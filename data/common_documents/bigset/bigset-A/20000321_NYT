MURRAY DOESN'T LIKE PASSING FANCY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Kings coach Andy Murray talks to players about
increasing their intensity, he also will mention the need to just
shoot the puck on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Monday he noticed the players passing a little too
much during Sunday's three power plays against Nashville, looking
for that one perfect chance.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget about it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take responsibility,'' Murray said. ``You say,
`I'm gonna get it to the net.' If it's in shooting position, you
should put it at the net.''
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT-WING LUC: Luc Robitaille practiced on the right wing
instead of his usual left wing. Murray said Robitaille approached
him before Sunday's game about the switch. Robitaille played some
right wing on Sunday, but he went scoreless for the eighth
consecutive game. He has one goal in his last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told Andy, if you get chances, the goals will come,''
Robitaille said. ``I've gotten a lot of chances lately: over 20
shots in the last three to four games. Got to keep shooting and the
goals will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille said playing right wing might give him a few more
one-time shots. Murray said Robitaille likely will be back at left
wing for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   FISET REACTIVATED: Goalie Stephane Fiset practiced strongly
Monday and will be removed from injured reserve in time for
tonight's game. Fiset strained the left side of his groin March 4
against Nashville and went on injured reserve two days later. He
will back up Jamie Storr tonight.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Fiset, the Kings assigned goalie Travis Scott
to Lowell of the American Hockey League. &QL;

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DON'T worry. Be happy. Whether Enron Field is only 90 percent
completed, or even 80, this diamond in the rough will be fit for
human occupancy. Not every nook and cranny may be painted or paved
or planted, but there will be baseball when the Yankees come to
town in the last days of March.
</P>
<P>
   The race to finish the ballpark at Union Station might even
offer a unique opportunity to demonstrate true Texas hospitality.
Remember those covered-dish suppers neighbors would bring to the
door when a family moved into a new home? This tradition is both
welcome and a way of easing the stress. The Astros deserve nothing
less.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of food, fans attending the opening of Enron Field may
wish to bring any heavy equipment or garden tool they happen to
have around the house _ a tractor, bulldozer, shovel, chainsaw,
hammer or pair of pliers.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, no additional contributions may be needed
from a sellout crowd of 42,500 fans. The voters showed they cared
three years ago by approving the funds that made the stadium
possible. Mi casa es su casa.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you have been reading, hearing or seeing, there
is no cause for panic. The grass is looking lush. The roof opens
and closes, which is about all one can ask of a roof. The
concession stands will be serving and the players playing. There
will be baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Those with tickets in the left- or right-field boxes are advised
to bring a large glove. They may even want to consider renting a
spare outfielder. The seats are closer to the foul lines than any
these eyes have ever seen. Drayton McLane Jr. said he wanted an
intimate ballpark. He wanted the fans to see the action up close.
Drayton has kept his word, just short of selling seats behind
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Any minor inconvenience, such as being stuck in traffic
overnight, may be viewed as part of the opening experience. Go with
it. Not many stadiums or arenas have been built without a flaw or
early shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   You know about the Astrodome, which was perfect but for the fact
the fielders could not follow the ball in the daytime, with the
sun's glare reflected off the spidery ceiling. You know about the
problems in Seattle and Milwaukee, which do not lend themselves to
cheap jokes.
</P>
<P>
   So take Philadelphia, please. The night they opened the
Spectrum, part of the roof blew away. Just like that, the 76ers and
Flyers were playing in an outdoor arena.
</P>
<P>
   And when the first hockey game was played in Madison Square
Garden, some of the sight lines were so bad you needed a periscope
to see what was happening in the corners. Who designed this place,
the critics inquired, a German U-boat commander?
</P>
<P>
   When hockey came to Cleveland, they had to cancel opening night
because the ice machine didn't work. At least there was no slime in
the ice machine.
</P>
<P>
   But in all the history of stadium building, there was nothing to
equal the unending complaints about Candlestick Park. When the
general manager stopped by one afternoon to see how the
construction was going, he saw boxes and machinery flying through
the air and workers clinging to various beams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the wind always blow like this?'' he asked one of the
workmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only between 1 and 5 in the afternoon,'' the laborer replied,
a time frame that did not bode well for day baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the hill they leveled to fill in the parking lot
was what kept the winds from blowing when the site was first
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   From the Candlestick press box, the writers discovered they
could see everything except home plate. The height of the
countertop and the placement of the chairs, which were bolted to
the floor, blocked any view of the batter, catcher and umpire.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the writers pestered the city to send out an engineer
to solve their plight. On the day he showed up, the Milwaukee
Braves were in town. When the engineer opened the door, what he saw
was the Braves' traveling secretary, 4-foot-2 Donald Davidson, the
original little big man, sitting on a stool, his legs dangling.
Donald had arrived early to update his stats. (Years later he
became a fixture with the Astros.)
</P>
<P>
   The engineer took one look, decided the writers had played a
tasteless trick at his expense, slammed the door and returned to
his office.
</P>
<P>
   If further encouragement is needed, there is the historic
example of Rice Stadium, with 70,000 seats, built at cost and in
nine months by Brown and Root, celebrating its 50th anniversary
this fall. They were still pouring concrete with three days to go.
The scoreboard was hooked up two hours before the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the stadium would be ready, George Brown paused, then
uttered his famous line: ``Is it a day game or a night game?''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LSU coach John Brady sounds like a man desperately seeking
attention when he blares, ``What's happened at LSU this year is the
greatest story in college basketball.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all, college basketball has produced no shortage of
inspiring, entertaining and courageous tales this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Brady's desire for a pat on the back is not unmerited. LSU
has undergone one of the top turnarounds in the country, going from
last place in its division in 1998-99 to a tie for first place in
the Southeastern Conference this season and, after wins over
Southeast Missouri State and Texas this past weekend, a trip to the
Sweet 16, the first for the Tigers since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, LSU went 12-15 and only 4-12 in SEC play. A year
later, the Tigers are 28-5, the second-most wins in school history.
Next up Thursday is Wisconsin at the NCAA Tournament's West
Regional in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I came to play for coach Brady,'' sophomore
sensation Stromile Swift said. ``I knew LSU had a good tradition,
and I believed in the coaches. I believed they would get good
players here. They have done an unbelievable job of bringing in
talent to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift, a McDonald's All-American in high school, was the big
coup for Brady's staff. The Shreveport native came to LSU despite
its probation for violations in recruiting Lester Earl, now at
Kansas, and its measly 9-18 record during Swift's senior season in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know about the probation matter, which has
limited the Tigers to nine scholarship players this season, with
only one scholarship to give for next year. But Swift said he
thought his arrival could help turn the team around.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, LSU posted six straight non-winning seasons before
this year's run. Four of those losing campaigns came under Dale
Brown, who coached the Tigers for 25 years, and two came under
Brady, who was a lowly 21-33 prior to this season's miraculous
turnaround. And many of those wins came against low-level
competition in non-conference play.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were 6-26 in the SEC in Brady's first two seasons.
Tiger Town was not a happy place to be.
</P>
<P>
   But the turnaround has been swift. Only two of the Tigers'
starters _ senior center Jabari Smith and junior Brian Beshara _
were even on campus at the beginning of last season. Swift was
sitting out his first semester to get a qualifying American College
Test score, Torris Bright was in high school, and Lamont Roland was
in junior college.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the Tigers turned things around, they have done it
against good competition. This year's squad has beaten seven teams
that were ranked in the Top 25, two more than LSU had ever
previously beaten in one season. A win over Oklahoma State in
December was the Tigers' first over a ranked opponent in 24 tries
dating to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tigers handled the pressure of the NCAA Tournament quite
well, thank you. Southeast Missouri hung around long enough to
threaten an upset, but LSU made big plays down the stretch to claim
a 64-61 win.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 seed Texas gave the fourth-seeded Tigers a scare as well,
sitting tied at 60 with three minutes to play. But LSU responded
with an inspired closing effort, highlighted by a sensational block
by Swift, to claim a 72-67 win.
</P>
<P>
   They have navigated previously uncharted waters with ease, and
according to Smith, the Tigers have seen enough to not be fazed by
any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've been stepping into the deep waters and all that
kind of water all year,'' Smith said. ``We're kind of used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Brady swam the waters at Samford, where he is
its all-time winningest coach, for six years before coming to LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Brady originally signed a five-year contract, but that was
extended an extra year following his first season. LSU athletic
director Joe Dean announced in February that he plans to seek
another extension and a hefty pay raise for Brady, who reportedly
ranks 10th in the SEC in pay, that will last through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Brady has us believing in ourselves,'' Smith said. ``We
had a different attitude coming in this year than we had last year.
We knew we were getting ready to make some noise toward the top of
the conference. A lot of other people didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a meteoric rise for the Tigers, who began the season
ranked No. 129 among Division I programs in the Jeff Sagarin
computer ratings. By January, LSU was in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until March before the Tigers moved into the top 10 of
the Associated Press poll, so Brady's suggestion that the media
were a bit sluggish in catching on to his Tigers' tale is accurate.
But LSU fans were a little slow in coming around as well.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful awaited the team's arrival from a win at Auburn,
which clinched a share of the SEC regular-season title. Nearly 200
were on hand in the wee hours Sunday, when the Tigers arrived from
a triumphant weekend in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament
at Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders how many will be on hand to pat Brady and his troops
on their backs next week, should LSU advance to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the LSU story is indeed one of the best in college
basketball.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
You saw this coming, right?
<TEXT>
<P>
   You saw Wisconsin over Arizona, North Carolina over Stanford,
Seton Hall over Temple, Miami over Ohio State, and Tulsa over
Cincinnati, right? (Actually, you should have seen Tulsa over
Cincinnati.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course you did. You also bought Microsoft when it was in the
teens and sold Procter &AMP; Gamble when it was still in triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, the back of that tear-stained NCAA
Tournament bracket that looked so promising Saturday morning will
make a good grocery list. Advil sales surged in Bracketville over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will point to all the high seeds losing,'' said Ohio
State coach Jim O'Brien, whose No. 3 Buckeyes lost to No. 6 Miami
in the South, ``but what it tells me is there are so many good
teams out there. You look at the 32 teams left after the first
round, and it was probably as good a 32 teams in the history of the
Tournament. There were some tough, tough games in the second
round.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the effect of all the favorites winning on Thursday and
Friday was better second-round games. For the first time since the
64-team field was instituted in 1985, the top five seeds in all
four regions won in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   No high-seeded team got a second walkover. Of those 20 teams
seeded 1-5 that advanced in the first round, 12 were bounced by
Sunday night. On consecutive days, the one, two and three seeds
from the West and South regions were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   There are more No. 6 seeds around (Miami, Purdue and UCLA) than
No. 1 seeds (Duke and Michigan State). There are the same number of
10th-seeded teams (Gonzaga and Seton Hall) as No. 1 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1981, two No. 1 seeds _ Arizona and
Stanford _ failed to reach the Sweet 16. And Duke, the top overall
seed, barely survived Sunday against Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to complain about where we were seeded,'' said
Tulsa coach Bill Self, whose Golden Hurricane seemed way too low at
No. 7. ``What you have in college basketball is a situation where
there are a number of really good teams. On any day, under the
right circumstances, a seven can beat a two, an eight can beat a
one. I'm not sure there are that many upsets in this thing
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   You want parity? For the first time since 1985, when the
Tournament was expanded to 64 teams, there is at least one team
seeded one through eight still alive after two rounds.
Interestingly, this is the first time since 1996 that fewer than
three teams seeded 10-16 remain.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 12 seeds in the Tournament, only five remain. That's
the fewest survivors among the top dozen since the current format
came into being in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Teams given up for dead _ like North Carolina, UCLA, Seton Hall
and Tennessee _ are alive. Teams that seemingly never had a shot _
like Wisconsin and Miami _ are ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then, this has to be the wildest Tournament ever. The
year with the most surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Using a formula that adds up the seeds of teams advancing to the
Sweet 16, this year's total of 85 is only the fourth-highest since
1985. The wackiest year was 1985, when the total was 89. In 1990
and '99, the total was 88.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this year's high total interesting is that there are
so few double-digit seeds remaining. Only the two No. 10s are still
alive. There isn't much left at the top or the bottom _ merely a
ton of teams seeded in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of second-guessing, last year's Tournament should
have been a tip-off that the way to figure the bracket is to look
for strong, underrated teams seeded in the middle or high end. And
beware vulnerable teams among the top four seeds _ Stanford,
Maryland, Illinois and Cincinnati come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there should have been neon lights around No. 6
UCLA playing a vastly overrated No. 3 Maryland. Tulsa was seeded
too low at No. 7, and the Golden Hurricane was a good choice
against a Kenyon Martin-less No. 2 Cincinnati in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga wrongly got no respect from the Selection Committee for
either its NCAA showing last season or its regular-season effort
this year. The Zags at No. 10 were a good upset pick for a couple
of wins, especially since No. 2 St. John's had no inside presence.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tennessee (No. 4 South) and Florida (No. 5 East) had
success in the tough Southeastern Conference. Ditto LSU (No. 4
West). The committee sold the SEC way short in the seeding.
</P>
<P>
   The real surprises so far have been Seton Hall, Purdue, North
Carolina and Wisconsin. Of those teams, Wisconsin is the only real
Cinderella. Among those who have made it this far, the Badgers had
to be the team least likely to make the Sweet 16 when the brackets
were announced.
</P>
<P>
   For a team with no basketball history, the Badgers look almost
like a team from another era _ the 1950s, say. They play a
deliberate motion offense and tenacious defense. Their game is most
assuredly below the rim. You almost expect Gene Hackman to be
coaching instead of Dick Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   They finished sixth in the Big Ten, playing only .500 in the
conference. If Wisconsin takes out LSU, don't be surprised if it
advances to the Final Four. Talk about setting college basketball
back a couple of decades. Nothing wrong with the Badgers' style of
basketball _ if you're a purist.
</P>
<P>
   However, most people watching the games this time of year
aren't. You can rest assured that outside of Wisconsin fans and a
number of high school coaches who preach fundamentals, not many
people are pulling for the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   Two points are clear after the carnage of top seeds over the
weekend. First, the Selection Committee doesn't have this seeding
business down to an exact science. For instance, did the committee
perhaps give the Pacific-10 a little too much credit?
</P>
<P>
   A case could have been made on Selection Sunday that neither
Arizona nor Stanford deserved a No. 1 seed _ Arizona because it was
without injured center Loren Woods; Stanford because it had lost
two of its final three games in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both were seeded No. 1, and both were bounced. Parlay
those defeats with No. 7 seed Oregon's first-round loss to Seton
Hall, and it's clear the committee didn't have a handle on the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the whole seeding process might need an overhaul.
Perhaps there is too much reliance on the Ratings Percentage Index
and strength of schedule and too little on what is actually
happening on the court, especially in the final two weeks before
the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious we can do better,'' said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski. ``I'm not blaming the people that do it. I think the
people that do it on the Selection Committee try to do the very
best possible job they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The second point that's clear? When filling out your
second-chance Sweet 16 bracket, it might be better to pick winners
based on what city you would rather live in.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ When talking about the Big Three who now reside
in the National League Central, it's understandable why Jeff
Bagwell gets overlooked.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire rewrote the record book, in the process redefining
the term power hitter, with his 70-home-run season for the St.
Louis Cardinals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa hasn't been far behind Big Mac with
129 home runs the past two seasons while beating McGwire for the
1998 Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   And how many times have we seen Ken Griffey Jr. _ the newest
addition to the Power Company after his offseason acquisition by
the Cincinnati Reds _ pose as he follows through with his crisp,
perfect swing?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   His home-run totals aren't as impressive, mostly the result of
playing his entire career in the pitcher-friendly Astrodome. He'll
also be the first to say he wrote the how-not-to book with his
unorthodox batting stance.
</P>
<P>
   Fans might crave the long ball, but across the board the Astros
superstar is on par with _ or slightly better than _ McGwire, Sosa
and Griffey in almost every other major offensive category:
</P>
<P>
   He has batted .304 each of the last two seasons, which happens
to be his career average.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit 20 or more home runs in each of the last seven
seasons, including 42 last season, one off his career high. He's
the only Astro to reach 40 homers in a season.
</P>
<P>
   He has driven in more than 110 runs five times, dating to his
MVP season in 1994, when he led the NL with 116 in a season cut
short by seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first full-time first baseman to reach 30 home
runs and 30 stolen bases in a season in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven major-leaguers who have hit 40 homers and stolen 30
bases in a season, only Bagwell and Barry Bonds have done it more
than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more of a complete player. He has been one the quietest
highly productive players in baseball the last seven years,''
Astros hitting instructor Tom McCraw said. ``He hasn't busted 70
home runs, but he's sure been steady with 30 or 40 home runs,
stolen bases and runs scored. He has no reason to take a back seat
to Sosa or McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in the background is fine with Bagwell, who has thrived in
a clubhouse of unassuming, hard-working players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a `legitimate' power hitter,'' said
Bagwell, the Astros' all-time leader in home runs (263), RBIs
(961), extra-base hits (598) and walks (885).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I hit for power, but I'm not like Mac and those guys who
are going to hit 10 home runs in a month. That's a lot of home
runs. I've hit (more than) 40 twice and 39 once, but it's hard to
maintain doing that. The legitimate power hitters are the guys who
hit the ball so far and are consistent with it. Those are the guys
who impress me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bagwell's teammates believe he would be included among
baseball's big bashers had he not played nearly a decade in the
Dome. Of Bagwell's 42 home runs last season, 30 came on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baggy would be hitting 50 for the last five years if we played
at any ballpark other than the Astrodome,'' teammate Craig Biggio
said. ``I'll take Jeff's numbers over any of those guys any given
day. That's not a knock on anybody, but I've played with the guy
and I know what he can do offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, 40-homer players are commonplace. The bar has been
raised, with Roger Maris' seemingly unreachable 61-homer plateau
shattered four times in the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Before '98, Sosa was recognized as a huge talent with big-time
pure home-run power, although not at the level he is today after
hitting 66 home runs two years ago and 63 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his appeal is as glamorous,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said of Bagwell. ``I think 65 or 70 home runs brings
a certain element of grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1996-99, Bagwell has a higher batting average (.302) and
on-base percentage (.439) while playing more games than McGwire,
Sosa and Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   He is a lifetime .304 hitter, 37 points higher than Sosa (.267)
and 35 points higher than McGwire (.269). Bagwell's career on-base
percentage is .416. His Gold Glove defense at first base also
attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question I have is how you get more consistent than what
he has been in his major-league career,'' McCraw said. ``He has
been as consistent a power hitter as anybody in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's teammates are also impressed with how he overcomes his
typically slow starts to still finish with a .300 average and more
than 40 home runs and 110 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you get a first baseman that hits 40 home runs
consistently the last five or seven years, that's something to talk
about,'' said pitcher Jose Lima. ``I've never seen anybody start
slow and still finish with 40 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw recalls, however, telling Bagwell there wasn't much he
could do to help with his unusual batting style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I don't know if I can help you with that, but
we're going to try and maybe we can work something out,''' McCraw
said. ``It's very unique, very different. It's something I've never
seen in 40 years of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said, ``He doesn't have a graceful swing. He bludgeons
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell doesn't regret the lack of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston usually does not get much attention,'' Bagwell said.
``I don't put myself in that realm anyway. People come to watch
Griffey, Sosa and McGwire. I'm not so sure people come to watch me
play, not to the magnitude of those guys. All their accolades and
all the publicity is well-deserved.''

LEE'S SUMMIT PATHOLOGIST APOLOGIZES FOR IGNORING CONGRESSIONAL
SUBPOENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the brink of a possible U.S. House vote to hold
him in contempt, Lee's Summit, Mo., pathologist Miles Jones has
apologized to Congress for ignoring a subpoena to testify about
fetal tissue marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Jones also for the first time denied allegations
that he sold aborted fetal tissue and organs for a profit, in
violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose fetal tissue business is under an FBI
investigation, said the last two weeks of scrutiny by the media and
members of Congress had ``resulted in significant personal and
professional ruination'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I now live in terror,'' Jones wrote in a letter
dated Friday and sent to Rep. Tom Bliley, a Virginian Republican
who is chairman of the House Committee on Commerce. Last week the
committee voted 34-0 to hold Jones in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be assured that I had no intention of undermining the
authority of Congress and do not want my actions to represent any
more than a personal failure of judgment,'' Jones wrote. ``I take
full responsibility for my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would be willing now to appear before any
committee of Congress ``without hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be enough to keep him from facing contempt action
in the House this week, said Steve Schmidt, spokesman for Bliley
and other Republicans who control the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee plans to move forward with contempt charges,''
Schmidt said. If the House votes for contempt, the Justice
Department would decide whether to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 47, was served a subpoena March 1 to appear at the March
9 hearing of the health and environment subcommittee. He did not
respond to the subpoena or to numerous calls from staff regarding
the subpoena, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Jones wrote: ``Unfortunately, my schedule was
completely filled, and I had patient care responsibilities during
the period requested by the subpoena. With limited time available,
I was unable to arrange for coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would not seek a lawyer and would submit to the
will of Congress on the contempt proceedings. Jones has not
responded to numerous calls from The Kansas City Star for comment
on the subpoena and the fetal tissue investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue and organs can be donated and fees charged only for
reasonable facilities, staff and shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   For about 10 weeks in 1998, Jones had a contract with
Comprehensive Health of Overland Park, Kan., the affiliated clinic
of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, to extract tissue
from aborted fetuses. He has done business in many states.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, in a hidden camera interview conducted by an ABC
News producer who posed as a potential investor in Jones' business,
Jones said he could make up to $50,000 a week and that a brain, a
liver or a kidney can bring ``what you can sell it for.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Jones said his secretly recorded comments on
national television ``have reinforced the opinion that I sold fetal
tissue for valuable consideration'' in conflict with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Jones wrote. But he
does not explain the numerous comments he made in the ABC
interview, shown on the 20//20 program, that the fetal tissue
business could be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the letter that would ease the concerns on
the committee about the undercover work of 20//20,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, a spokesman for the National Right to Life
Committee Inc., said a lot of unanswered questions remained about
Jones and his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me is that these matters need to be investigated
with Dr. Jones under oath,'' Johnson said. ``The questions need to
be answered under the penalty of perjury.''

SPRINT AND MCI WORLDCOM ADDRESS CRITICS OF PROPOSED MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint Corp and MCI WorldCom Inc. on Monday filed a joint reply
with federal regulators to address comments and petitions that were
submitted to deny their proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen parties, including competitors, labor groups and
individuals, weighed in with formal comments on the deal during the
public comment period at the Federal Communications Commission. The
commission also received a slew of letters from individuals, small
businesses, consumer advocates _ even a church.
</P>
<P>
   Critics think the merger would create too much concentration in
the long-distance and Internet markets, allowing the new WorldCom
to control prices and quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   Many have urged regulators to deny the merger or subject it to
strict conditions, such as the forced sale of some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In their filing, Sprint and MCI WorldCom focused on the
long-distance and Internet markets and tried to demonstrate that
``there's no basis to believe that the merger ... will jeopardize
vibrant competition in either sector,'' said Jonathan Sallet, chief
policy counsel for MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Sallet and Vonya McCann, Sprint senior
vice president of federal external affairs, summarized the 150-page
filing and stressed points that they said were supported by
independent studies:
</P>
<P>
   - More than 98 percent of households nationwide are served by at
least three carriers that own their own network facilities, with
more than 90 percent being served by four or more such carriers.
</P>
<P>
   - More than a third of customers who switched from MCI WorldCom
or Sprint in a 12-month period switched to an emerging carrier
rather than to AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom or Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   - More than a dozen emerging carriers provide the full panoply
of advanced voice and data services that large businesses need,
contrary to critics' claims that AT&AMP;T, Sprint and MCI WorldCom
dominate those markets.
</P>
<P>
   - The regional Bell companies intend _ when permitted by
regulators _ to enter the four states that account for more than
half the country's long-distance traffic. (Those states are
California, Texas, Florida and New York.) Reductions in
long-distance rates by the Bell companies would compel traditional
carriers to lower their rates further.
</P>
<P>
   - Fiberoptic capacity has doubled since 1995 and is still
increasing dramatically, allowing competitors easy access to the
Internet market and preventing any company from dominating the
market or controlling prices.
</P>
<P>
   - New technology allows Internet service providers to route
their traffic over the network providing the best service, which
would undermine the new WorldCom if it provided poor service.
</P>
<P>
   Sallet and McCann also said the new WorldCom would be
regulators' best hope for bringing a new, competitive
communications platform to American consumers in addition to their
phone and cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI WorldCom have invested heavily in fixed wireless
spectrum across the country, buying companies that used the
licenses to provide wireless cable television services.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is to use that spectrum to deliver voice and
high-speed data services to consumers and businesses, particularly
in remote areas where landline services can be uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to receive approval for their merger from the
Department of Justice, which examines the deal from an antitrust
perspective, in late spring. The FCC is expected to render a
decision in the second half of 2000.

60'S RIGHTS LEADER IS ARRESTED IN DEATH OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page.) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three days after he was accused of the shooting death
of a sheriff's deputy, the former civil rights leader who was known
as H. Rap Brown was arrested on Monday night in a rural Alabama
field after an exchange of gunfire in the small town of Whitehall,
police officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now a Muslim cleric known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the
fugitive had been the subject of a nationwide manhunt since Friday,
when a Fulton County Sheriff's deputy said Al-Amin had shot him and
another deputy as they tried to serve him with an arrest warrant
Thursday night on minor charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deputies, Ricky Kinchen, died Friday afternoon after
receiving several gunshot wounds from a high-powered assault rifle.
Aldranon English, the deputy who identified Al-Amin, was still
hospitalized with lesser injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Monday night, Atlanta Police Chief
Beverly Harvard said that Al-Amin was captured by federal marshals,
FBI agents and deputies of the Lowndes County, Ala., sheriff's
department. Whitehall is a small town between Selma and
Montgomery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In interviews broadcast on local television stations, Bill
Imfeld, an FBI agent based in Mobile, said that federal agents had
begun looking for Al-Amin in Whitehall all day after learning that
he had friends and associates there from his days of association
with the Black Panther party in the 1960s. After knocking on doors,
several agents were fired on near a house at about 5:30 p.m., and
then called in backup officers, Imfeld said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and local law enforcement agencies then flooded the area
with officers, helicopters and dogs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dogs were turned loose, they flushed out H. Rap
Brown, and he ran right into the arms of a waiting sheriff,''
Imfeld said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said that several people in the Whitehall area were
detained on the possibility that they may have been harboring
Al-Amin as a fugitive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said a handgun was found in the field where Al-Amin was
caught, but she did not know if it had been used in the Atlanta
shooting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officers did not find the assault rifle that had been used in
the shooting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett described herself as
``ecstatic'' that Al-Amin had been caught before the funeral, which
is set for Tuesday, of her deputy.
</P>
<P>
   English, was extremely relieved that the suspect had been
caught, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I can sleep,'' she quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was in custody in the FBI office in Montgomery, Imfeld
said, adding that he would likely be charged on Tuesday and then
transported to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard would not comment on reports that the FBI may have
tracked down Al-Amin through the use of electronic wiretaps and
cellular phone transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin had been underground for several years in the 1960s and
1970s after being accused of inciting a riot and transporting a gun
across state lines while under indictment. FBI agents had feared he
might stay in hiding for some time because of his experience on the
run, and because of what they called a large network of supporters
across the country who could hide him.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared after the Thursday night shooting, leaving behind
a bewildered flock of followers in the largely black Atlanta
neighborhood called the West End, who said Al-Amin had renounced
violence when he formed the mosque and began working with community
groups to clean up the area.
</P>
<P>
   A blood trail had been found from the site of the shooting to a
nearby vacant house, but authorities were unable to track him from
there.

IN SACRAMENTO, NADER SAYS OUTSIDER STATUS IS HIS STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SACRAMENTO _ Consumer activist and Green Party presidential
candidate Ralph Nader said Monday he is the only candidate left for
people who are disgruntled with the political system.
<P>
   The collapse of major-party candidates John McCain and Bill
Bradley, along with the disarray in the Reform Party, show that
there is room for another candidate, Nader told reporters before a
speech to the California Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the theme that unites both conservative and liberal
voters is that they are losing control rapidly over everything that
matters to them,'' Nader said. ``That's what we appeal to _ the
recovery of control so that we have a government of, by, and for
the people instead a government of Exxon, by General Motors and for
the Duponts.''
</P>
<P>
   America has been taken over by corporations that are only
concerned with the bottom line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our democracy is being highjacked by giant corporations that
are controlling everything from government to the media, the
workplace, even exploiting childhood with commercial
entertainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to show that there are a lot of solutions in this
country that are not being applied to serious problems,'' he said.
``And that can occur if we have stronger democracy and new
progressive political movement.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are
part of the problem, not a solution, Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting a broad-based, progressive political movement
to end once and for all the limited choice Americans have between
Tweedle Dum Republican and Tweedle Dee Democrat, both in hock to
big corporate interests and money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he plans to campaign across the country, hopes to
raise several million dollars and would like to qualify for federal
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's March 7 open primary, Nader received 101,165
votes, or about 1 percent. There were 108,904 registered Green
Party members as of February 7, according to the Secretary of
State's office.
</P>
<P>
   Nader received less than 1 percent of the vote when he ran for
president in 1996. He spent less than $5,000 of his own money on
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 250 nurses, Nader said the country's health
care system is in shambles, and called for a universal system
similar to one in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HMOs are destabilizing themselves by their own greed, by
their manhandling of the professions in the medical and nursing
areas, and their abuse of consumers,'' he said. ``I think we are in
a real transition period here that gives us a great opportunity to
recast our health care system into a nonprofit mode and expand to
universal health care.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nader said he does not see either Gore or Bush taking on the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have their fingers to the wind to see what
kind of public demand is out there,'' he said. ``Right now I see
piecemeal and complex proposals by two politicians who are afraid
to take on the big drug companies and the big HMOs.''

GRITTY GONZAGA RULES OVER ITS IN-STATE BIG BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Can't imagine the Kingdome looking any worse next
Monday morning than my NCAA men's basketball tournament bracket
does now.
</P>
<P>
   But after stepping through the dust, broken concrete and twisted
re-bar of the bracket carnage, there is a rose: Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's been there for two years. That might qualify it
as a weed, at least in the eyes of Washington and Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the college hoops world wants to pinch the
Zags' cheeks between thumb and forefinger and exclaim,
``wudgie-wudgie-wudgie!'' they are a mortifying embarrassment for
their state brethren in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough that a 4,000-student school in a second-tier
conference can beat the bejeezus out of the Huskies and Cougars,
then make madness from a No. 10 tourney perch.
</P>
<P>
   But doing it mostly with in-state kids ... well, the bag has yet
to be made big or thick enough to hide the chagrined faces of the
Huskies and Cougs.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the state of Washington in the Pac-10
this season gave new meaning to the term subterranean. The Huskies
tied for eighth at 5-13 (10-20 overall) and the Cougs were last
(1-17, 6-22). Included in each season was a 10-point loss to the
Zags.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen victories between the state's high-profile jock
factories while the Zags are at 26 and counting must be a little
like Garth Brooks winning the Grammy for best new hip-hop artist.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's small size, high tuition and academic standards and
remoteness (wait: I-90 does go through Spokane, so civilization is
reachable) would seem to be a recipe for Division I mediocrity.
Instead, the program flourishes while the Huskies and Cougars
languish.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason some smaller private schools can do well in
basketball is because there's no football program to drain athletic
department resources. St. John's, St. Bonaventure, Iona and Seton
Hall are among tourney teams this year that don't have campus
competition for the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest virtue for Gonzaga is it feeds well after the
big dogs eat, getting the most out of overlooked state kids. The
Pac-10 duo annually seems to lose a handful of elite players to
out-of-state programs, then keeps casting the net to California and
other national points where competition from basketball-serious
schools is more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, meanwhile, more than makes do with state leftovers.
Leading scorer Richie Frahm is from Battle Ground, near Vancouver.
Leading rebounder Casey Calvary is from Tacoma's Bellarmine.
Starting guard Mike Nilson, now injured, is from Seattle's
Shorecrest. Freshman forward Zach Gourde is from Vancouver's
Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Another four reserves are in-state, and floor leader Matt
Santangelo is from Portland. Next year, Prairie's Dan Dickau, a UW
transfer, figures to start at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had six state players on the roster, but only
Ballard's Michael Johnson and Sammamish's Chris Walcott played a
lot, and Walcott was a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   The state kids Washington missed on is a familiar story:
Stanford's Curtis Borchardt, Utah's Phil Cullen, USC's Brian
Scalabrine, San Jose State's Billy Landram and Oregon State's Jason
Heide, to name just a few double-figure scorers _ not to mention
struggling stars Jamal Crawford and Doug Wrenn, nor Arizona's
recent All-America guard, Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Huskies' collapse this year after consecutive
NCAA appearances, a historic trend has continued: In the past
half-century, Washington's nine tourney entries have coincided
exclusively with a quality 7-foot center.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, it was Bob Houbregs. In 1976, it was James
Edwards. In the mid-80s, it was Christian Welp, ably aided by
Detlef Schrempf. And the previous two years, it was Todd
MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   Though it can be argued that a good big man will make any
Division I team a contender, the Huskies have never recruited well
enough to make it during the many ``short'' years between goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fact of life not only for current coach Bob Bender, but
predecessors Lynn Nance, Andy Russo and Marv Harshman. Without an
occasional sprinkling of galootism, the Huskies' tourney drought
probably would have gone back before TV shows starring Milton
Berle.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would have happened had the Huskies not stumbled
onto the obscure MacCulloch, an ungainly, lightly recruited former
hockey player from Winnipeg. Every program gets lucky once in a
while, but Washington has shown little ability to flourish without
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a lack of in-state Division I talent _ nationally,
including UW, WSU, Gonzaga and Eastern Washington, 70 state kids
are playing at the top collegiate level this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, starting next year, will a bad gym be an excuse, because
Hec Ed's renovation should eliminate a big recruiting disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, who has demonstrated some strategic and recruiting
shortcomings, will definitely find his seat toasty next season. But
it can't be overlooked that Husky basketball mediocrity is almost
institutionalized. Whatever the causes of the UW travail, the rise
of Gonzaga has made the scrutiny more acute.
</P>
<P>
   Give Bender credit for a willingness to schedule the Zags every
year. But the results lately recall a mood 20 years ago, when the
Huskies were thrilled that another little Jesuit outfit, Seattle
University, gave up big-time basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Being given a can-o-whuppin' annually by the little brother
makes living in the state family real edgy.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The nation's breadbasket may ride a strong
economic boost from the Clinton administration's announcement
Monday that it will ban MTBE, the controversial gasoline additive.
</P>
<P>
   Although the additive cuts down on smog, officials said it has
caused widespread water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious effect of the announcement will be an increased
demand for ethanol, the corn-derived fuel that could replace MTBE,
said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have a dramatic impact on farm programs and farm
income,'' Glickman told the press Monday at a joint conference with
EPA Adminstrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   First, they said, MTBE should be banned. Then Congress should
remove a Clean Air Act requirement that gasoline in areas with
serious air pollution contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.
Both MTBE and ethanol have been used to meet that requirement; they
both add oxygen to fuel to help it burn cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Clinton administration wants to require a small
percentage of all gasoline to be made from renewable sources, such
as ethanol and other grain-derived fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA proposed banning MTBE on its own, but the process could
take three years, Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action by Congress is the fastest and best way to address the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the nation's fuel is reformulated gasoline,
which includes more oxygen. Nearly 90 percent of that has MTBE,
used in 17 states and the District of Columbia. St. Louis is the
only area where the reformulated fuel is used in Missouri or
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, actually, is in almost all gasoline, but in levels of only
3 percent to 8 percent. In reformulated gas, it's added by at least
twice those levels.
</P>
<P>
   Studies estimate thousands of community water wells in dozens of
states may be contaminated by MTBE, or methyl tertiarybutyl ether.
The problem is that MTBE is very soluble _ 30 times more so than
benzene, a common water contaminant related to gasoline. And MTBE
doesn't degrade as rapidly. All this makes cleaning up MTBE spills
more difficult and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The water pollution problem shouldn't be called a crisis,
Browner said, but it's a growing concern in many communities. Some
states, led by California, have already decided to ban the
additive. Missouri regulators had already said the fuel should not
be allowed here.
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural impact of today's announcement could reach
beyond corn growers, especially if the government requires the use
of more renewable fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news for our farmers, for our energy security and
for the environment,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri corn growers are happy to compete for the market, said
Gary Marshall, executive director of the Missouri Corn Growers
Association. But Marshall worries that partisan politics will
stymie the effort, especially because it is an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said Monday that the Clinton administration's
turn toward ethanol was political and follows a Republican lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the timing of this looks political,'' said David
Israelite, director of political and governmental affairs for the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have pushed for some time to boost ethanol, said
Daryl Duwe, spokesman for the Missouri GOP. ``Farmers know who was
with them and who wasn't,'' he said. ``Republicans have been with
them for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall noted that just last week some Republicans introduced
legislation in Congress similar to the Clinton administration
proposal introduced Monday. ``There should be some common ground
here where we can craft some bipartisan solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on Monday, Missouri's four Republican House members
released a letter they sent to the administration in January urging
a commitment to ethanol. Rep. Jim Talent of Chesterfield, speaking
for those House members, said the administration's actions Monday
were clearly the right thing to do ``regardless of the motives.''
</P>
<P>
   As for consumers, the impact is less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had projected a ban of MTBE could increase
gasoline prices up to 5 cents a gallon. But Browner on Monday
predicted little impact on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the use of ethanol, Marshall added, could even reduce
gasoline prices. Corn prices, after all, are at an all-time low.
Federal tax incentives also boost ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol is a steal right now,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, ethanol has a major environmental advantage over
MTBE, Browner said, because it doesn't pose great water pollution
threats. But tests found that MTBE did more to reduce ozone than an
ethanol blend. The ethanol blend was more volatile, meaning
pollutants more easily waft into the air to form ozone, the main
ingredient of smog.
</P>
<P>
   But some oil companies have recently begun to produce fuel for
ethanol blends that isn't as volatile, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it happen in the last year in St. Louis,'' he said.
``And they did it at the same price or below.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, increasing the use of renewable fuels might increase
gasoline prices, said Steve Mahfood, director of the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources. But, in the long run, it should
help decrease prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City metropolitan area, regulators hope the oil
companies can design a special blend _ not reformulated gas _ that
would reduce the city's ozone levels. The best solution for
everyone, including consumers, would be a national fuel that
reduced air pollution, Mahfood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the administration is finally stepping up to
the plate,'' Mahfood added. ``This is the right thing to do, and
it's about time that they did it.''

$1.72 MILLION AWARD ANOTHER BLOW TO TOBACCO COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A jury here delivered a blow to the embattled
tobacco industry Monday, awarding $1.72 million to a woman who
developed lung cancer after smoking for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The award against Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and R.J. Reynolds
Corp., which is expected to increase with punitive damages, is the
first in favor of a smoker who took up the habit after 1965 when
the Surgeon General required warning labels on all cigarette
packages.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the latest in a handful of verdicts that have gone
against the reeling industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really reflects a total collapse of the industry's
ability to defend itself in court,'' said Richard Daynard, a
professor at Northwestern University and head of a research project
on the tobacco industry. Until Monday's verdict, he said, cigarette
companies were considered unbeatable in cases brought by those who
took up smoking after the warnings labels came out.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's verdict, a jury of seven men and five women found
that Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds knew about the health hazards
of smoking and deliberately misled the public about those dangers.
After more than six days of deliberation, the jury awarded Leslie
Whiteley, a 40-year-old mother of four from Ventura County, $1.47
million for medical costs and pain and suffering. The panel awarded
her husband Leonard $250,000 for loss of companionship.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that the two tobacco giants had committed
fraud. The panel will go back to court to consider how much, if
anything, the companies should pay in punitive damages. The award
could far exceed the compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley began smoking at age 13 while growing up in Ventura
County and didn't quit until 1998 when she was diagnosed with lung
cancer. During those 25 years, she smoked Marlboros and Camel Light
100's.
</P>
<P>
   The Ojai woman, who is married to a truck driver, sued Philip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds last year, claiming that she developed the
cancer from smoking cigarettes and from exposure to the asbestos
that her father picked up on his clothes at his workplace.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's verdict, the jury found that Metalclad Insulation
Corp., which Whiteley said supplied and installed the insulation at
her father's workplace, was not liable for any damages.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, lawyers for the tobacco companies said that
Whiteley, who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, should shoulder
part of the blame because they said she smoked marijuana and
disregarded her doctor's warnings not to smoke during her four
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she liked smoking and didn't want to quit,'' Philip
Morris attorney Chris Hardy told the jury during closing arguments.
He said that the industry should not be held responsible for her
illness because she had been exposed to the warning labels since
she began smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury apparently was swayed by Whiteley's lawyer, Madelyn
Chaber, who said that the industry deliberately targeted its
addictive product to children and teenagers, including her client.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first case brought by an individual smoker to go
to trial in California since a jury in San Francisco last year
awarded $51 million to Patricia Henley, a longtime smoker who had
sued Philip Morris after developing lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The judge later reduced the verdict to $26 million and the case
is now on appeal. A month after the verdict in favor of Henley,
Philip Morris suffered another defeat when a Portland, Ore. jury
awarded $81 million to the family of a Marlboro smoker. The judge
later slashed the verdict to $32 million. Recent verdicts in New
Jersey and Florida in favor of smokers have been tossed out in
appellate court and are winding their way through the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The Whiteley case has been overshadowed by a class action
brought by smokers in Florida. Last year, the Miami jury found that
the nation's biggest cigarette makers had concealed from the public
the dangers of smoking. The industry is now facing what could be a
record-setting punitive damage award.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco jury returned the verdict after the close of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Philip Morris shares
fell 1/8 to close at 19 15/16. Shares of R.J. Reynolds, based in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, fell 5/16 to 16 1/2.

 CLINTON ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO PHASE OUT GASOLINE ADDITIVE MTBE  &HT;     By BERNADETTE TANSEY and KENNETH HOWE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Following California's lead, the Clinton administration moved
Monday to phase out the fuel additive MTBE to avoid further
contamination of groundwater by the suspected carcinogen.
<P>
   The announcement by the Environmental Protection Agency was an
about-face for EPA administrator Carol Browner, who has long
resisted calls by California legislators to ban the foul-smelling
chemical from gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is an octane booster that
was widely incorporated into vehicle fuels after Congress amended
the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require the use of smog-busting
oxygenates in regions with poor air quality.
</P>
<P>
   But the chemical that helped clean the air was soon found
leaking into groundwater tables, raising the concern that water
quality was being sacrificed to reduce harmful emissions. Gov. Gray
Davis has ordered the additive banned in California by the end of
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA plan, which isn't expected to have an immediate effect
on gas prices, pushes ethanol as a substitute to MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Browner is asking Congress to amend the Clean Air Act to phase
out MTBE, but she also proposed separate EPA regulations that will
ban the chemical under a federal toxics control law if Congress
defeats the legislative proposal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer said she was ``very happy'' at the
announcement, which could take an estimated three years to
implement. The California Democrat said she had argued that the EPA
had the authority to act on its own to ban MTBE, but the agency
insisted that only Congress had that power.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said Congressional action would avoid a long and
cumbersome process required under EPA rule-making procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislative action is the first and best line of defense,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EPA plan, the ethanol or other fuels from renewable
sources would replace MTBE. Ethanol, which can be made from corn,
is also an oxygenate.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint press conference with EPA, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said the plan would increase farm income and create
jobs in rural America.
</P>
<P>
   But some refining groups and administration critics said the
ethanol requirement was a politically motivated sop to boost Vice
President Al Gore's presidential election chances in Midwestern
agricultural states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it would be a mistake to substitute one (additive)
mandate for another,'' said Edward Murphy, a spokesman for the
American Petroleum Institute. ``That's how we got into this in the
first place, legislating the content of gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis asked EPA in April to waive the ethanol requirement and
allow California refineries to make gasoline without ethanol or any
other oxygenate. Davis said new techniques allow oil refiners to
forgo oxygenates and still meet the state's strict clean fuels
requirements as well as the federal air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., blasted EPA for ``stalling''
a decision on that request. He said EPA recently informed him no
decision would be reached until summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Solomon, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, praised Browner's plan but said the group will be
``watching EPA like a hawk'' to make sure MTBE is completely phased
out with no increase in harmful emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differ on whether the price of gasoline would rise in
California when MTBE is phased out and if manufacturers are
required to use ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Tosco Corp., an early advocate of the MTBE ban, has suggested
that price increases could be minimal as refiners substitute other
additives for MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating MTBE from California's gasoline supply is likely to
boost fuel prices, at least in the short run. That's ironic because
adding MTBE in the first place cost about 5 cent to 8 cents a
gallon by some estimates and reduced fuel efficiency as well.
</P>
<P>
   Taking MTBE out of gasoline raises prices because it reduces the
amount of fuel available in California, according to Severin
Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   That's because refineries in California can produce a maximum of
about 1 million barrels of gasoline a day. That total grows by
about 10 percent when MTBE, produced outside the state, is added to
the refined fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Because California refineries cannot physically produce more
gasoline, the elimination of MTBE shrinks supply by 10 percent and
raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE now functions as a sort of gasoline extender because it
makes up about 11 percent of the volume of fuel. Removing MTBE
would require replacing that percentage with gasoline, boosting
demand and raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron spokesman Fred Gorell said adding ethanol as a
substitute could also raise gas prices because it would force
refineries to change fuel formulas in a way that would increase
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The California Energy Commission has estimated that if the state
switches to ethanol, gasoline prices in the first three years would
increase by 6 to 7 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The prime reason for the price hike is the increased demand for
ethanol. Currently U.S. production stands at about 110,000 barrels
a day, according to the commission. California alone would need
about 50,000 to 60,000 barrels to meet its needs _ about half the
total supply _ injecting enormous new demand on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, as ethanol production ramped up, the increase would
shrink to 2 to 3 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But spokeswoman Claudia Chandler noted that the commission's
estimates were based only on California changing to ethanol. If the
federal rules required all states to make the switch, the effect on
supply and thus prices would be far greater.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica, where groundwater wells had to be closed down
in 1995 due to MTBE contamination, officials warned that a
phased-in MTBE ban will not bring a quick end to the problems
caused by the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Perkins, the city's director of environmental and public
works management, said clean-up costs for the area's groundwater
table could mount as high as $150 million, and no surefire method
has yet been devised to remove MTBE from water.
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Monday by the American Chemical Society
estimates that as many as 9,000 groundwater wells in 31 states may
be contaminated with MTBE.
</P>

RARE SEA BIRDS, MAMMALS ENDANGERED BY FISHING PRACTICE IN  MONTEREY
BAY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thousands of rare sea birds and hundreds of
marine mammals are being entangled and killed in fishing nets in
the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary _ and it's all perfectly
legal.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage is caused by commercial fishing boats that lay gill
nets in the sanctuary to catch halibut. Populations of the esteemed
fish have surged off the Central Coast in recent years, leading to
a fishing industry boomlet.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally not illegal to fish either commercially or
recreationally in national marine sanctuaries, which were
established to protect marine resources. Evironmentalists are
increasingly pushing for greater fishing restrictions inside the
sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two wild species have proved particularly vulnerable to the gill
nets in the Monterey sanctuary: a deep-diving seabird known as the
common murre _ which is not particularly common _ and the harbor
porpoise. Sea otters, California sea lions, harbor seals, and
elephant seals have also been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
the federal agency that manages the sanctuary, estimate that up to
2,500 murres and more than 100 porpoises may be killed by the gill
net fleet each year.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the kills, NMFS began posting observers on some of
the halibut boats last April. Don Peterson, the coordinator of the
halibut gill net observer program for NMFS, said the agency is
empowered with enforcing the federal law aimed at protecting marine
mammals, the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is the porpoises,'' said Peterson, ``but
speaking as a private person, the murre take does seem high to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   William Sydeman, a marine ecologist and the director of marine
sciences at the Point Reyes Bird Observatory, said ``perhaps 12,000
to 15,000 murres have been killed (by gill nets) during the past
five years. That's very significant, because murre colonies (in the
area of the sanctuary) are very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Murre populations have also been diminished in recent years by
other factors, said Sydeman, most notably oil spills. In the early
1980s, there were about 600,000 murres living off the California
coast; now there are about 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   So many murres and porpoises may be dying, say some scientists,
that government efforts to bolster the flagging populations of
these species may be undermined.
</P>
<P>
   The state is spending $5 million to re-establish a murre colony
on Devil's Slide south of Pacifica. While the program has been
successful, many of the birds fly south after the nesting season to
forage in the Monterey sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ironies implicit in the situation. The first is
the abundance of the halibut, which is stimulating the gill net
fishery. Until a few years ago, halibut populations off Central
California were relatively small, due to pressure from trawl net
boats.
</P>
<P>
   But state regulations restricting the trawlers have brought the
halibut back, creating a small bonanza in the process. Up to a
dozen boats now set gill nets for the succulent fish, which can
reach forty pounds in weight and bring $2 to $4 a pound to the
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if a state law had not been passed that resulted
in a resurgence of halibut, murres and porpoises would not be
drowning in gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it is likely many of the afflicted murres are
beneficiaries of a costly government program calculated to revive
their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, a petroleum barge owned by the Apex Oil Co. leaked
about 25,000 gallons of oil as it travelled off the coast. Ten
thousand or more seabirds died as a result, and the company agreed
to pay $6.4 million to settle a suit brought by the federal and
state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money, explained Paul Kelly, a marine wildlife
biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game, is
devoted to re-establishing a murre colony on Devil's Slide south of
Pacifica.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last 20 years, humans have pummeled murres on the
Central California Coast,'' said Kelly. ``We're using $5 million in
public funds to restore this valuable wildlife resource, and it's
being jeopardized by gill net drownings.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said his agency will continue to collect data through
next year, and then recommend possible policy changes. These could
include requiring gill netters to fish deeper water, where birds
and porpoises are fewer. Currently, gill net fishermen can fish in
water no shallower than 30 fathoms, depths that lie about three
miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Gill nets, which catch fish by ensnaring their gills with mesh,
are popular with commercial fishermen. Though gill nets are
associated with the killing of untargeted species, they are not
considered as environmentally destructive as drift nets and trawl
nets. They are not, however, as benign as hook-and-line.
</P>
<P>
   The agency may require fishermen to install ``pingers'' _
devices that attach to the nets, sonically alarming the mesh so
that the porpoises can avoid entrapment. The pingers also work well
to alert murres, said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation
of Fishermen's Associations, a commercial fishing lobbying and
education group, said he was not aware that there were problems
with the Monterey gill net fishery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of it, but our approach has
always been that if there's a problem, we're going to fix it,''
said Grader. He noted that his organization has worked to reduce
wildlife mortality in other state fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a lot of other industry organizations, we're not in
denial about these kinds of things,'' said Grader. ``We're going to
look into it. We don't want anyone gratuitously screwing with
fishermen, but we will do what's necessary to stop birds from being
killed _ we don't care whether they're endangered or if their
populations are healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the gill net mortality is so high that it may be hard
for the fishery to justify operating in the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism represents tremendous money in Monterey,'' he said.
``There is a huge economy based around people who go out to see
marine birds and cetaceans in their natural habitat. When you look
at the small number of boats involved in gill net fishing and
factor in the money expended on the murre restoration program and
the observer program, it doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson acknowledges that tourism is a huge business in
Monterey, but maintains the halibut fishery also contributes
substantially to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, commercial halibut fishermen using all types of gear
_ including gill nets and hook-and-line _ landed 199,099 pounds of
halibut in the region between northern Big Sur and Moss Landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a very lucrative fishery for these guys,'' Peterson
said. ``During the summer, a boat can land 200 fish a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how it will ultimately be addressed, the Monterey
gill net problem points to a bigger issue: What activities are
appropriate for marine sanctuaries?
</P>
<P>
   Warner Chabot, West Coast director for the Center for Marine
Conservation, observed that each of the country's 12 marine
sanctuaries operate under different rules, but that fishing is
generally allowed in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Monterey sanctuary was created in 1992, fishermen were
guaranteed that there would be no new regulations beyond those
already established by the California Department of Fish and Game
and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without those guarantees, the fishermen would've withdrawn
their support, and the whole plan could've collapsed,'' Chabot
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a provision in the 1972 federal legislation that provides
for the creation of national marine sanctuaries requires a
re-evaluation of each sanctuary's management plan every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it has been eight years since it was created, that
process has just begun for Monterey,'' Chabot observed. ``This is
an excellent opportunity to look at the management policies for all
the living resources there _ including fishing.''

OIL EXECS LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sure, gas prices are high, but you get more for
your money these days.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night at the Chevron at 24th and Geary in the Richmond,
Tom Sweeney reports, a saxophone player was accompanying motorists
who were singing the blues while pumping unleaded regular at $1.99
a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   There was no cover charge for the show, but there was a
two-gallon minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Al Cattalini was filling up at a station in Rohnert Park when he
was approached by a panhandler with an empty gas can. Brother, can
you spare a gallon?
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest thing: Canhandling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the big boys at the oil companies really aren't milking us
like the last cow on the farm, but explain this:
</P>
<P>
   In Carmel, a home on the Pebble Beach golf course has been
rented for $1.2 million for the 10 days of the U.S. Open. My Carmel
spy, Daryl Glen, says his impeccable sources tell him the renter is
a big oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the kicker: The oil boys aren't even going to use the
house, only the patio. That's $120,000 per day for a few people to
sit on a redwood deck and say, ``Hey now, is that Davis Love III?''
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING ELSE scary about gas: I heard an expert on the radio
say that surplus gasoline can't be stored to carry us through times
of shortage, because gas goes bad.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you just drop some Rolaids down the tank?
</P>
<P>
   How do you know when gas has gone bad? Does it start to smell
good?
</P>
<P>
   If you get a tank of bad gas, in order to send it back, do you
have to go to the station attendant's booth and demand to speak to
the  &UR; sommelier? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I KNOW who really stole the Oscar statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   It's so obvious, you'll kick yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment of trophies got ripped off from a loading dock in
Los Angeles last week and was found early Monday morning in a
Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Fulgear, Dumpster diver by trade, made the find. Fulgear
said, ``My foot hit one. It was heavy and I opened it up. ...
Everybody knows who Oscar is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood does the movie version, Willie Fulgear will be
played by Willie Nelson. It will be a loose remake of ``The Maltese
Falcon,'' another suspense thriller that was much ado about a
statue.
</P>
<P>
   But whodunit? Well, the motive was jealousy. The Academy named
the award after him and then never gave him one. They treated him
like dirt. He is disgruntled by nature. He lives in a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it was Sesame Street's Oscar the Grouch.
</P>
<P>
   A SAD STORY behind every sale at the car auction at SFO's
long-term parking lot. You leave your car there too long, they
seize it and auction it off.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Jacobs is a regular at the auctions, and last Thursday, a
young woman approached him before the bidding. She's a Cal student,
British accent, her car was being auctioned off, she was desperate
to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs told her the used VW would go for about a grand, maybe
$1,200. She was distraught. He told her, ``Try making an
announcement.'' So with dewy eye, she told her story to the 35
assembled bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to understand,'' Jacobs says, ``this is a
ruthless crowd. I go to a lot of auctions, and the group here is
the bottom-feeders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidding starts, auctioneer asks opening bid of $25. Woman bids
$25. Crowd starts chanting, ``Sold! Sold! Sold!'' Nobody bids.
Woman buys back car for the price of a tank of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it didn't hurt that she was pretty,'' Jacobs says.
</P>
<P>
   WHY JOHNNY can read: Because of people like Amanda Gerrie.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern California Children's Booksellers Assn.,
independent Bay Area booksellers, gave out its 18 literacy grants
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   One went to Gerrie, who works for the S.F. Department of Human
Services and has a caseload of about 100 families on public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those families don't own book one, so the kids start
school with two strikes against 'em. Amanda will use her grant to
give books to kids on special occasions _ birthdays, holidays _ and
encourage parents to read with the children.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody said education is not filling the bucket, but lighting
the fire. So here's to a great bunch of pyromaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER LOPEZ brought Union Square to its knees Sunday. John
Konstin, prom-dress shopping with his daughter, saw Lopez in Saks
and then in Neiman-Marcus, shopping-bag-loaded like a pack mule.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, remember, stunned the Grammys with a dress that was a
designer version of a hospital gown worn backwards. If Ms. Lopez
were to steal a phrase from cowboy poet Baxter Black, she might say
that dress ``exposed my expose.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you get dresses like that off the rack at Saks and Neiman?
If so, how come you don't see 'em around town?
</P>
<P>
   THE SPIN from new 49ers' owner Denise DeBartolo York's spokesguy
is that both parties walked away happy, but you can't bet (sorry,
bad word choice) that Eddie DeBartolo wasn't whistling a peppy tune
when he signed away his beloved 49ers to his sister Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She gets the team that Eddie built to greatness, then kissed
away in a sordid gambling mess. He gets a bunch of stuff worth a
lot of dough.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Denise declined Eddie's offer to flip a coin, double or
nothing.

WATSON HAS LASER EYE SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA point guard Earl Watson had laser surgery
Monday to repair a mildly detached retina in his left eye. The
incision- free procedure took 15 minutes and is not expected to
impair Watson's vision for Thursday's Sweet 16 game against Iowa
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great spectrum of retinal detachments, and this was
mild,'' said Dr. Steven D. Schwartz, an eye specialist who
performed the surgery at UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not affect his vision. He'll be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson will not wear goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz believes the detachment existed before Watson was
elbowed in the eye during the Bruins' 105-70 victory over Maryland
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary because it was dealing with my eye,'' said
Watson, whose eye was swollen and purple _ like he'd been hit by
Oscar De La Hoya. ``It was throbbing during the game, but now it
feels a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the most celebrated eye injury to a UCLA basketball player
since Lew Alcindor suffered a scratched cornea before the historic
game against Houston at the Astrodome in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know this, but (Alcindor) had one eye dilated,
and that's why he had a bad night,'' Schwartz said. ``He had a
corneal abrasion. Earl's injury is a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be the most important injury of Watson's
career.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was elbowed in the left eye by Maryland guard Steve Blake
three minutes into the game _ just before the celebrated sequence
in which Watson blocked Blake's layup at one end, then tossed an
alley-oop pass to Jerome Moiso for a dunk at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Watson left the game for three minutes as UCLA's trainers
stopped the bleeding. He played the game of his life (17 points, a
school-record 16 assists and no turnovers) and then received four
stitches in his eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   When Watson awoke Monday, his eye was throbbing and almost
swollen shut. Coach Steve Lavin sent him to the Stein Institute for
a checkup, and that's when a small amount of retinal fluid _
signaling a detachment _ was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   During the procedure, called a laser retinopexy, Schwartz sent a
laser beam through Watson's pupil to the back of the eye. The laser
``tacks the retina down,'' Schwartz said, which seals the
detachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had (the detachment) for quite a long time, and it
just happened to be discovered today,'' Schwartz said. ``For that
reason, we were lucky to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Watson hadn't gone for the checkup, the detached retina
wouldn't have been discovered until preseason medical exams next
fall, Schwartz said. By then, the detachment could have become
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Watson did not practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Bruins will depart Los Angeles this morning for
Detroit. They'll practice Wednesday afternoon at The Palace of
Auburn Hills. Thursday's game will start at approximately 6:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 placed Cal center Nick Vander Laan on probation for
elbowing UCLA center Dan Gadzuric in the mouth during the Bruins'
March 2 victory in Berkeley. Conference commissioner Tom Hansen
ruled Vander Laan's swinging elbow did not come in the normal
course of protecting the ball. He is on probation for the
pre-conference portion of next year's schedule, meaning a repeat
offense could result in a suspension. &QL;

VISORS OR NO VISORS? THAT IS THE QUESTION IN NHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Toronto's Bryan Berard undergoes surgery today
in an attempt to regain some sight in his right eye, NHL players
are debating whether visors should become standard equipment with
every helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Berard would be playing today, and the Maple Leafs would be
trying to overtake New Jersey for the top spot in the Eastern
Conference, if he had been wearing a visor when Ottawa's Marian
Hossa inadvertently struck him with his stick following through on
a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto was streaking before the March 11 incident. It is 1-2
since and it will be difficult to make up five points on the Devils
with just 10 games to go. But the bigger issue now is whether
players can overcome a longstanding prejudice against the visor and
make the league a safer place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to some guys and they still go, `Look at those
chicken Europeans putting the visors on.' What a bunch of
(bleep),'' Alexander Mogilny said after he was traded from
Vancouver to New Jersey. ``What are those guys going to tell
(Berard's) family? That he took one for the team? You protect
yourself first and you don't listen to what anyone else says. We're
talking about a man's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons players claim they don't wear them.
The puck often looks distorted when players stare down through
visors. They often fog up and get wet when players go into the
corners. Some players feel claustrophobic. And they often spend the
entire time between shifts cleaning the shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went away from the visor because it bothered me a little
when I looked down at the puck,'' the Red Wings' Sergei Fedorov
told reporters in Detroit. ``It changes perception when you look
down to handle the puck. I want to see everything well and the
visor didn't give me a chance to have excellent vision. For guys
who work with the puck most of the game, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also is a macho thing. Fans and opposing players taunt
players who wear visors as if it is not manly to protect your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Vincent Damphousse said he sometimes hears insults
from opponents because of his visor.
</P>
<P>
   ```You're a (bleep), you wear a shield.'`' Damphousse told the
Oakland Tribune. ``It's just the old attitude. I think it's
childish. It's probably like when guys first started wearing
helmets. I'd rather save my eyes. If I get my teeth knocked out, I
can still smile. If I get my eye knocked out, I can't see from one
side. If players are smart enough, they'll start wearing them if
they're smart enough to understand the importance of their eyes,
they'll start wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The league is littered with stories of eye injuries, but none as
gory as Berard's. It is likely he will never play again.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators' Chris Phillips, who plays on the same line as
Hossa, almost lost an eye two years ago when he took a puck in the
face. He's been wearing a visor ever since. Radek Bonk, the other
member of Hossa's line, also has put on a visor. ``Losing your
vision was definitely a scary thought,'' said Phillips. ``That's
why I still wear my visor. I learned the hard way. It took a puck
in the eye for me to learn a lesson to put it on. I feel safer with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Joe Sakic played 11 years without a visor but started
wearing one this season after taking a stick in the eye. His new
teammate Ray Bourque has worn a visor since early in his 21-year
career after he was hit with a puck above his eye and was sidelined
for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said peer pressure prevents some players from wearing
visors. ``Especially kids who come in with something to prove,'' he
said recently. ``They don't want to come in with a visor. But some
guys just don't want to take the time to get used to them, too. The
sweat gets in there, and the fog. It takes some getting used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar to the 1979-80 season, when the NHL
mandated that every player coming into the league had to wear a
helmet. The ruling was grandfathered in, meaning if you didn't wear
a helmet, you didn't have to start. Now it is standard equipment.
Visors are mandatory in youth, junior and college hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Damphousse says there are products to apply to the visor to cut
down on fogging. He also thinks it's a bad rule that anyone wearing
a visor who initiates a fight gets an extra two-minute penalty. The
league says players with visors who start fights have an unfair
advantage and the rule isn't going to change.
</P>
<P>
   And some players think wearing visors makes players less
respectful of one another because there is no fear of injuring
someone's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wear a shield and I bet I was cut seven or eight
times around the mouth by high sticks,'' Tampa Bay defenseman Paul
Mara said. ``Then I took it off, and I can't remember the last time
I was hit with a high stick.''
</P>
<P>
   ISLANDERS PULL DEAL
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before sending rookie center Ryan Johnson and
minor-league left winger Dwayne Hay to the Lightning for Mike
Sillinger, the Florida Panthers thought they had agreed to a
blockbuster deal that would have brought New York Islanders
defenseman Kenny Jonsson and leading scorer Mariusz Czerkawski to
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders general manager Mike Milbury and Panthers GM Bryan
Murray apparently had worked out a deal that would send Oleg Kvasha
and Ivan Novoseltsev to New York. But Islanders owner Ed Milstein
stepped in and killed the trade because he did not feel two
unproven prospects were worth the price of both Jonsson and
Czerkawski, who is having a career year.
</P>
<P>
   Murray isn't happy, especially after watching a three-for-three
deal featuring Jonsson, Jorgen Jonsson and Claude Lapointe derail
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury and Murray say talks can continue over the summer
because Jonsson and Czerkawski will be Group II free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury is concerned with Jonsson's history of concussions and
was looking to deal Czerkawski because if the forward gets five
more goals for 30, it would trigger an $800,000 bonus in his
contract. &QL;

FIZER &AMP; CO. WILL BE PLENTY FOR UCLA TO HANDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA can thank Dayton coach Oliver Purnell for its
latest predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, Central Connecticut State, the Big 12 and everyone else
Iowa State thrashed this season they can all thank Purnell, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the coach of the U.S. World University Games team (WUG) last
summer, Purnell cut Iowa State junior forward Marcus Fizer after
the final round of tryouts. That made Marcus mad. And when Marcus
got mad, Marcus hit the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State hasn't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   Picked last in the Big 12 in preseason polls, the Cyclones won
their first conference title in 55 years and are 31-4 entering
Thursday's Sweet 16 showdown with UCLA at The Palace of Auburn
Hills (Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus has made our team,'' Cyclones coach Larry Eustachy
said. ``The (WUG failure) was a real motivator for him. He worked
real hard to make the team, then he slacked off. He got
comfortable. He got out of shape. (The experience) changed him.
He's just a lot more motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer wasn't bad before he got mad. He was a McDonald's
All-American at Arcadia (La.) High and a first-team All-Big 12 pick
last year. But a Purnell-inspired summer has turned him into a
first-team All-American and leading contender for player of the
year awards.
</P>
<P>
   He added 17 pounds to his 6-foot-8 frame while dropping his body
fat dropped from 16 percent to 9. His bench press increased from
300 pounds to 350. His vertical jump improved two inches. He shot
hundreds of 3-pointers and has improved his percentage from 21.4
last year to 39 this year. He's quicker, stronger, more durable and
closer to unstoppable than any player in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (the WUG), coach Purnell and I talked, and there are no
hard feelings; he just chose other guys,'' Fizer said. ``Once that
was over, I just dedicated myself to Iowa State.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer averages 23.2 points and has five 30-point games in the
last month. He's shooting 59 percent from the field and 72.5
percent from the foul line, where he spends most of his time. He
averages 7.8 rebounds a game. He's been double-teamed,
triple-teamed and zoned, and nothing's worked. He can overpower
defenders in the post or step outside and bury 3-pointers. In
talent and body type, he's strikingly similar to another Louisiana
power forward, Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could lock him in the locker room, that would be my first
choice,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said when asked about defending
Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had more success against Fizer than any coach in the
Big 12, holding Fizer to 34 points in two games. But the Jayhawks
lost both because they couldn't score against the Cyclones'
ferocious defense (opponents shoot 41.6 percent) and because they
couldn't contain Fizer's supporting cast: undersized power forward
Stevie Johnson; shooting guard Michael Nurse, a third-team
all-conference selection; and point guard Jamaal Tinsley, the Big
12 newcomer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A junior from Mt. San Jacinto Junior College, Tinsley has given
Iowa State the floor leadership required for March Madness
survival. He's a Brooklyn native with a flashy, slashing New York
City game. He's a superb penetrator who's averaging 19 points and
6.5 assists in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference-maker between them being an average team last
year and a great team this year is Jamaal Tinsley,'' Oklahoma coach
Kelvin Sampson said at the Big 12 tournament. ``Marcus Fizer is a
great, great player, don't get me wrong. But do you know why he's
stepped up his game? A lot of it has to do with Tinsley, who I
consider one of the top point guards in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a lot about (Ohio State's) Scoonie Penn and (Michigan
State's) Mateen Cleaves, but Tinsley is right there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the tournament began, few outside the Big 12 had ever
heard of Tinsley, Nurse or Johnson. That's because Iowa State is
the anti-UCLA. It was on national television once during the
regular season. It has never been to the Final Four. (UCLA has won
11 NCAA titles.) It has one McDonald's All-American, Fizer. (UCLA
has four.) Even the teams' makeup is different. The Cyclones have a
slew of no-name, overachieving junior college transfers, while UCLA
has none. The Cyclones have one starter over 6-4, Fizer, while UCLA
has four. They have an injury-depleted bench, while UCLA is healthy
and goes 11 deep.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the No.2 Cyclones might be the higher seed, but
they have a smaller margin for error Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA may be the most talented team, when you add depth, in the
country,'' Eustachy said. ``There's all kinds of areas they can
murder you.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State is a product of its coaches: Tim Floyd, who recruited
many of the players, including Fizer, before bolting for the
Chicago Bulls in 1998; and Eustachy, an Arcadia native who looks
like David Duchovny and coaches like Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Equal parts motivator and strategist, Eustachy turned an
undersized, modestly talented team that finished 15-15 last year
into the Big 12 champ and Final Four contender. With Fizer's help,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the worst, and none of us wanted to go through
that again,'' Johnson said. ``We added Jamaal, and everything has
fit just right. We knew we weren't going to finish eighth or ninth.
When people asked if they thought we could make the NIT, we'd say,
`Yeah, blah, blah, blah.' But we knew we'd be better. Coach
Eustachy made us mentally tough, and when we saw how well Marcus
was playing, we knew no one would stop him.'' &QL;

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CLEVELAND _ The least the Cavaliers could have done is send those
who sat through this thing home with free chalupas. It was all the
smattering of friends, family and neighbors seemed to want anyway.
A 98-85 win over the worn-out Rockets on Monday did not seem to
interest them.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A five-game road trip weighed on the Rockets as if they were
sloshing their way through the Ohio mud. They hit the accelerator,
but the engines coughed and the tires spun with futility.
</P>
<P>
   For even the Cavaliers, the Rockets were mere road kill. Losers
of six straight themselves coming in, the Cavs rolled over the
Rockets as if they were a speed bump.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not satisfy. The 13,241 _ many cleverly disguised
as empty seats _ wanted their chalupas. And when the Cavaliers,
scoreless against the Rockets' drive-through defense in the final
two minutes, dropped the chalupa chance, they were booed.
</P>
<P>
   In a new indignity for the Rockets, a victory over them was
apparently not deemed worth Cleveland's cheers without the literal
greasing of the customers' palms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young team to be out nine days, four games in five days,
it's pretty tough,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``We're a
road-weary team right now, and that was about as ugly as it gets.
We couldn't make plays in the open court, and we couldn't shoot it,
and we turned it over.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have gone on, but there was little point. The more the
Rockets seemed to press to stay within range of one of the NBA's
worst offensive teams, the more they seemed to run themselves back
in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   They held their last lead with 4{ minutes left in the third
quarter when Steve Francis scored six consecutive points to finally
offer some help for Walt Williams, who had scored the Rockets'
first 15 points of the second half. But both players seemed to wear
themselves out by the effort. No one came close to picking up the
slack.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Francis each finished with 17 points. But a day
after scoring 25 in Toronto, Shandon Anderson did not score at all
in 27 minutes. A day after scoring 12 points in 27 minutes, Hakeem
Olajuwon had two points, making one of five shots, in 16 minutes.
Even when the Rockets did not have to move to score, they misfired,
making just 12 of 23 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was tired,'' Francis said. ``Everybody was thinking
of going home. It shouldn't have been like that. I thought we had a
good chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely took a step backward tonight, because we didn't
play with much intensity, and we didn't make any shots. Our defense
was really lacking tonight, and it doesn't make a difference who
the team is, Cleveland or LA. We still didn't play that good. They
wanted to win. We wanted to win. But we didn't prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets walked slowly out of the Gund Arena locker
room, the midnight charter never looking so good, it was not the
road that had them feeling so worn and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The setback extended their losing streak to eight games, their
longest uninterrupted stretch of defeats since they began the
1982-83 season 0-10. The winless road trip was their worst since
another 0-5 trip in January 1973 _ before any of their current
guards were born.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, the Rockets have gone 4-13. And no
matter how difficult the road might be, the losing has begun to
weigh on them more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to get used to losing,'' guard Cuttino Mobley
said. ``I've never lost like this. I'm not a loser. I'm having a
lot of trouble with it. I don't know how to cope with it right now.
I don't like losing. Nobody likes to lose. But I take it real
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Rockets had effective moments, they seemed out of
sync, almost haphazard offensively and slow defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs came in having made just 43.7 percent of their shots to
rank 24th in the league. But after shooting just 35 percent in the
first half, they made 55 percent in the second half, even with
Randy Wittman clearing his bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tired,'' Cavaliers guard Bob Sura said of the
Rockets. ``We didn't feel like they were ready in the beginning,
and we took advantage of it in the second half and wore them down a
little bit with the fast break.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Cleveland wore them down a lot. The Cavaliers did not
play particularly well, but their most free-wheeling players, Andre
Miller and Sura, took over, combining for 28 points, including 23
in the second half. The Cavaliers rolled up 59 second-half points.
But even they did not seem too enthused with the rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the prettiest of basketball games _ especially in
the first half, when I thought both teams struggled shooting the
ball,'' Wittman said. ``But for us, we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the surge by Williams and Francis put the Rockets ahead,
the Cavaliers easily outscored them 26-10 over the next 10 minutes.
The Rockets made four of 12 shots in that stretch, committed five
turnovers and finally gave in and sat every starter with 7:41 left,
knowing they had nothing more to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had eight-day road trips before, but never with so many
games and not with two back-to-backs,'' Williams said. ``I was
tired out there. I was just trying to fight through it. Losing so
many games, we were just trying to fight through that, just trying
to win a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're losing like this, you just try to stay positive,
to think of positive things. It's hard to take. We have to keep
fighting. We have to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night moved closer to home, victory seemed further away.
But the Clippers are in town Thursday. And for the first time in
two weeks, so are the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, however, the best they could manage was to prevent a
run for the border.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TRUE NORTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Kimberly Kafka (Dutton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of Kafka's first novel is Bailey Lockhart, a
35-year-old woman who has fled a troubled past to find solace as a
medic and bush pilot in the remote wilderness of Alaska. She lives
alone in a cabin 80 miles upriver from the nearest community, a
Native village with which she stays in touch by radio. The book
opens when she agrees to fly two tourists _ they claim to be
looking for a ``wilderness adventure'' but are really searching
illegally for Alaskan gold _ from Anchorage to a deserted lodge
five miles upriver from her camp. Add to this the romantic
attentions of Kash, a Native leader and realistic man who is trying
to look after the interests of his people, as well as the despair
and animosity felt toward Whites by many residents in the village,
and you have a pretty interesting look at major issues in Alaska
today. The plot lags a bit during the characters' seemingly endless
travels up and down the river, but Kash is appealing, Bailey is
strong and utterly capable, and their wilderness lives make for
good reading. Kafka, who is a wilderness emergency medical
technician, lives in Alaska and Wisconsin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PENGUIN BOOK OF IRISH FICTION'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Colm Toibin (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toibin begins this anthology with a challenge: ``If you want to
read about the vagaries of the human heart,'' he says, ``or the
fleeting nature of love or time, read Goethe's lyrics; but if you
want to know about the unreliable nature of narrative in a time of
landlords, read Maria Edgeworth. If you want to know how love can
lead to marriage, read Jane Austen; but if you want to delve into
the secret and dark unconscious of an embattled ruling class, read
Bram Stoker, Charles Maturin and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.'' Such is
Irish fiction, a territory in which, to paraphrase Maria Edgeworth,
reality is too strong, passion too violent, the world too feverish
to look upon without the disguising balm of language. Toibin has
assembled fiction from the time of Jonathan Swift to that of Emma
Donoghue, who was born a mere 31 years ago. Included are broad
selections from James Joyce, as well as excerpts from Roddy Doyle's
``The Snapper,'' Edna O'Brien's ``The Country Girls,'' Oscar
Wilde's ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' John Banville's ``The Book
of Evidence,'' Iris Murdoch's ``The Red and the Green'' and many
others.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By David Liss (Random House, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Weaver is a man who performs work of a ``delicate
nature'' on behalf of rich and illustrious men, clients who are
driven to insult him but whose barbs Weaver shrugs off ``as a bear
tosses off the dogs sent to bait it in Hockley-in-the-Hole.''
Weaver is the consummate outsider: He is a former boxer who now
works as a private investigator, of sorts; a brainy, brawling
thug-for-hire. He is also a Jew, which distances him further from
the men he serves. More important, he is the tremendously appealing
narrator of this first novel, one of the best to come along in
yearszk)])in 18th-century London, ``Conspiracy'' takes Weaver into
a complex case that begins when he learns that the seemingly
accidental death of his father, a stock-jobber to whom Weaver had
not spoken in 10 years, was really a murder. Weaver's work becomes
personal then, and he throws himself into an investigation that
goes deep into the world of British finance and into the dark
territory of the city's criminal elite. It's great entertainment,
which Liss serves up with intelligence, historical accuracy and
rip-roaring ambition. Enjoy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``JANE GOODALL: 40 YEARS AT GOMBE'' &QL; 
 &UR; (ST&AMP;C, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had a conversation recently with a man of a certain age, who
told us that the consensus among men of his generation is that Jane
Goodall was, as he put it, ``a babe.'' We confess we had never
heard that word applied to Goodall (and we imagine that she would
be amused to know of it), but we were reminded of the sentiment as
we looked at the early photographs in this book. They are personal
memories for so many people, these images of a barefoot, slender
young woman in shorts, long hair tied back, her attention given
over wholly to the intelligent animals that she would study all her
life. Her first article on the chimpanzees of the Gombe Stream Game
Reserve in Tanzania appeared in ``National Geographic''in 1963, and
it was not long before everyone knew who Goodall was. Today, she is
66 and travels constantly on a public relations mission to preserve
and enhance the lives of the creatures she came to love. This book
is a reminder of what a great combination youth, daring and
commitment can be. And he's right: She was something to see.  &QL;

 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED IT; ALSO MOVING IN THE

 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller's takes a quick looks at some current magazine
issues and a popular website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CONSUMER REPORTS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for
used cars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely Science Lite, but the April issue includes a
couple of interesting pieces. The cover story details the discovery
of ancient Roman ships near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the
Tuscany region of Italy. Researchers have found the remnants of at
least 17 ships dating from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 and yielding
a number of artifacts, including incense burners, oil lamps, fish
hooks, sewing needles and numerous amphorae _ large earthen jars
used to transport goods around the Mediterranean. There's also an
interesting story on the world's ``deadliest carnivore'' a
half-mongoose, half-cloud leopard called a fossa, which lives in
Madagascar and apparently spends much of its food budget on Lemur
Helper. Our intrepid explorers actually manage to catch one of
these slick dudes, and then pass the tranquilized cat around for
polaroids. Way to be ecosensitive, dude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOLF'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong message emanating from this magazine, and that
message is: ``We want to sell you some really expensive golf
clubs!'' Or a luxury car. Or both. Still, this issue includes some
interesting features, including an 18-hole ``course'' on everything
from repairing divots to teaching your kids to play. Of course,
like most articles in the magazine, some of these helpful hints
double as ads _ many of the ``solutions'' involve buying cool stuff
or going to a ritzy resort. If you really want to ruin your swing,
consult some of the technical-sounding instructions in the back,
with lines like ``the upper spine is farther from the target than
the lower spine.'' Uh huh. And the ball is rolling through the
desert. There is also a fun feature that names the nation's 10 best
public courses. Arizona made the list, with Apache Stronghold in
San Carlos. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE NEW YORKER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Includes one of those great articles that keep you coming back
for more _ a feature story on the top writer for ``The Simpsons,''
a former ``Harvard Lampoon'' staffer named George Meyer. It is
Meyer who writes many of the lines that are quoted from the wildly
successful series. Even his fellow writers stand pretty much in awe
of him. ``I would rather make George Meyer laugh than win an
Emmy,'' a colleague notes. Meyer, who traces his comedic roots back
to ``Mad'' magazine, culled his craft working for David Letterman
and Lorne Michaels. Writer David Owen does a nice job drawing Meyer
out, getting him to describe a less-than-idyllic childhood filled
with way too much television. There is also a well-done piece by
political correspondent Joe Klein which notes that John McCain
spent much more time adopting a posture of indignance than actually
explaining his positions. He says McCain plowed his jet into the
George W. Bush aircraft carrier, crippling both campaigns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE REVIEW: www.yesterland.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are things that just work better on the Web.
Yesterland is one of them. With an astounding commitment to detail,
the site chronicles Disneyland attractions that have closed over
the years, complete with pictures and narrative histories.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about nostalgia. All those rides that you remember from
childhood are here: the campy Submarine Voyage (``helmsman, steer
clear of the teetering columns!''), the Old Matterhorn (pre-1978)
and the Skyway to Tomorrowland/Fantasyland
</P>
<P>
   (those old buckets that hang on the wire, closed in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   There is a piece on the old PeopleMover (presented by Goodyear,
closed in 1995), which pushed guests around with motors installed
in the track, taking them through Tomorrowland's indoor attractions
and above its outdoor attractions. And don't forget Rocket to the
Moon, a ``D'' ticket that later became Mission to Mars, until it
closed in 1992. Today, it's a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   How deep does this site go? It even includes a long feature on
the old parking lot, which has been closed to make way for a new
slate of rides and other attractions. The article notes that those
who arrived early could park in the ``convenient Bambi section,''
but those who came late ``could be way back in Thumper or Winnie
the Pooh.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Al-Amin nabbed after shootout in Alabama
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the former Black Panther wanted in last
week's shooting death of a Fulton County sheriff's deputy, was
captured Monday night in White Hall, Ala., after an exchange of
gunfire with federal marshals, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, formerly known as H. Rap Brown, had been the subject of
a nationwide manhunt since Thursday night when two Fulton County
sheriff's deputies were shot while trying to serve an arrest
warrant in Atlanta's West End.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Richard Kinchen, 35, died of his wounds; Deputy Aldranon
English, 28, is recovering from his injuries at Grady Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's arrest was the result of information investigators
received soon after the deputies were shot, Atlanta Police Chief
Beverly Harvard said at a late-night press conference at City Hall
East.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was located Monday afternoon at a house in White Hall,
between Selma and Montgomery. As federal authorities closed in
around 6:30 p.m., shots were fired, Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowndes County Sheriff Willie Vaughner said no one was injured
in the exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin fled to some nearby woods, which were surrounded by law
enforcement authorities. With the help of tracking dogs from the
Alabama Department of Corrections, Al-Amin was flushed from the
woods and arrested without further incident, Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents took Al-Amin, who was wearing a white shirt, sweat
pants and sunglasses, into custody at the Montgomery Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said a handgun was found in the woods after Al-Amin's
arrest. She said it is not known whether this gun was used in the
shooting earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said Deputy English had
expressed relief about Al-Amin's arrest. ``He said, `Tonight I can
sleep.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that it happened in this time frame,'' the
sheriff said, referring to today's funeral service for the slain
deputy. ``This will add a different air to the service. On a good
day this would be a difficult service, this will help us through a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said Al-Amin will be arraigned in Alabama on federal
charges of firing on federal agents. A warrant has been issued in
Atlanta charging him with murder and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she does not know when Al-Amin will be returned to
Georgia. She would not elaborate on how investigators tracked him
to Alabama beyond saying that it was due to information they
received early in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Several other people were detained in White Hall, she said, ``as
it relates to the possibility of their harboring a person that we
had a warrant on.'' About six people were being questioned but were
not under arrest as of Monday evening, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she does not know what connection Al-Amin has to
the White Hall area in general or specifically to the house where
he was found.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, as H. Rap Brown, was a field organizer for the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Greene County, Ala., and
worked to register voters in Lowndes County, then a segregationist
and racist stronghold, in 1966 and 1967, according to historians.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Panther Party had roots in Lowndes County. The panther
was adopted as a symbol of black voting rights after a mass meeting
in the county more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The late civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael left Lowndes
County after that meeting and helped lead the Black Panther Party
to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn University history professor J. Wayne Flynt said the
Black Panthers capitalized on the Rev. Martin Luther King's
Selma-to-Montgomery march, which passed through Lowndes County, and
organized people who may have regarded the Panthers as part of
King's movement.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Panther movement in Lowndes County today, Flynt
said, but Al-Amin would likely still have friends there. ``What I'd
think you'd find is people who were personal friends of Brown and
Carmichael.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she does not know how Al-Amin was able to travel
from Atlanta to Alabama. She said investigators still have not
found either the black Mercedes that was at the scene of Thursday
night's shootout on West End Place, or the .223-caliber assault
rifle that was used to shoot Deputies English and Kinchen.

   BANGLADESH-VILLAGE (Joypura, Bangladesh) _ Of all the distant
villages, in all the poor countries, in all the Third World,
President Bill Clinton was supposed to visit theirs. And sitting on
a cane stool under a 150-year-old banyan tree, he was to talk with
the peasants of Joypura. It was to be Clinton's rare chance to hear
from people of the Bangladeshi soil and, in turn, their opportunity
to rub elbows with a man of global power. But at the last minute,
the visit was canceled. Instead, buses with hundreds of villagers
were taken to Dhaka to meet Clinton, who became the first American
president to visit this populous, impoverished nation. By Barry
Bearak. 1,300 words.

COYOTE RETOOLS TO PIONEER NEW MARKET
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Coyote Network Systems Inc., which
began as a maker of telecommunications switching equipment, is
reinventing itself, complete with a new name, the company said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders at the Westlake Village company are being asked to
approve a new name, Quentra Networks Inc., to go with the new
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Tony Squeglia said the company wants to emerge
as a provider of Internet services through a specially designed
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is going through a transition period,'' he said.
``We believe there are a lot of people who are not comfortable with
adapting to a new type of technology like a PC.''
</P>
<P>
   The company took its new name, Quentra, from the word entrance
because its new service will allow customers an entrance to
services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The future, according to Coyote, is being able to do online
shopping, bill paying, stock trading and other Internet services
through a telephone with a screen and keyboard and a port to insert
a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The company is working on developing partnerships with credit
card companies and utilities it isn't naming yet. The partners
would allow their customers to use the phone and the service to pay
their bills or to receive special offers, Squeglia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we'll be the first to market these services,'' he
said. ``We're not creating anything new; the technology all
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Vik Grover of Kaufman Bros LP, an investment bank, said
the movecould expand the market for Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales and revenue models are untested, however,
and the service itself is so new it is difficult to say with
certainty how the company will perform, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally new company; they have had a lot of doubters of
the old management,'' Grover said. ``It's a work in process.''
</P>
<P>
   One marketing strategy might be to give away the phones to
customers who sign up for the service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Squeglia said the company hopes to integrate the services of a
company it purchased in 1998, Inet, which provides international
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to begin launching the service by summer.
</P>
<P>
   It has some advantages over PC-based Internet access, Squeglia
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will always be on. You're always connected, so it's not a
question of having to boot up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is in discussions with digital subscriber line
companies to provide high-speed broadband Internet access, he said.

SCRAP COLLECTOR FINDS OSCARS; MAY GET $50,000 REWARD, ATTEND
AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Willie Fulgear came from Chicago to Los Angeles
some 40 years ago to find fame and fortune as a rock 'n' roll star.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 61, the junk salvager finally has found celebrity and
appears headed toward the Academy Awards and a $50,000 reward _
after finding 52 of the 55 stolen Oscar statuettes in a Koreatown
trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go, me and my son,'' Fulgear said Monday. ``I
think I earned it. I saved Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan is to buy me a home. I'm going to put it in my son's
name so it will be his house. I'm 61 years old: I want to leave my
son something.''
</P>
<P>
   Academy of Motion Picture Arts &AMP; Sciences officials said they
hope to invite Fulgear to the awards ceremony Sunday as a way of
expressing their appreciation for his good deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to wait until the Police Department completes its
investigation before we decide who we thank, acknowledge and
appreciate, but we'd certainly love to invite him,'' said academy
spokesman John Pavlik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling a little nervous yet. We're hoping to invite
him, but we want to be absolutely sure before we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Fulgear deserves the reward, and they have arrested
two men they suspect stole the golden boys from a loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank him from the bottom of our hearts for coming
forward,'' Los Angeles police Detective Robert Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Hollywood-perfect happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Fulgear found the Oscars, detectives announced on
Monday that they had solved the March 10 theft of the statuettes
from a Roadway Express shipping dock in Bell. And they have clues
about the whereabouts of the three other missing statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway dock worker Anthony Keith Hart, 38, of West Covina and
Roadway truck driver Lawrence Edward Ledent, 38, of Los Angeles
were arrested over the weekend on suspicion of grand theft, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   They were being held at Parker Center with bail for each set at
$100,000, and are expected to be arraigned in court this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they could make some money off them,'' said Los
Angeles police Detective Marc Zavala.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime employees knew what was in the boxes they were
loading: Fifty-five unengraved Oscars, valued at a total of
$18,000, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the theft of filmdom's most coveted awards became an
international !ital!cause celebre!off!, the thieves wondered
whether they had made a blunder of ``Ishtar'' proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they knew they couldn't do anything with them and
everyone was looking at them, that's when they panicked,'' Zavala
said. ``They figured it was just a matter of time before somebody
would tell on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The men dumped the Oscars next to a green Dumpster behind a
supermarket at Venice Boulevard and Western Avenue near Koreatown,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Fulgear comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Once a rock 'n' roll musician who warmed up shows for big-name
acts in Chicago, Fulgear now makes his living recycling metal he
scavenges. ``In Jackson, Miss., I won the talent contest. I came in
third place, but that's still a winner,'' he recalled wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, he was going through trash bins looking for
boxes for his belongings because he and his son had been evicted.
He literally stumbled on the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked over to the bin and my foot hit something heavy. I
picked it up and opened it. I didn't know what it was. I loaded it
into my car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing them real fast into the trunk because I was
afraid somebody might come and take them. I'm a junk man, a scrap
man. I deal with metal and stuff. I thought it might be brass or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of what he had, Fulgear opened the cardboard boxes later
and found the 24-karat gold-plated symbols of Hollywood's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The police _ and Academy _ were glad to get Fulgear's call, even
though three of the statuettes are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said detectives are investigating whether Hart or Ledent
might have kept the three missing Oscars for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the person who does have possession will do the
right thing, call the police and turn in the missing Oscars,''
Zavala said.
</P>
<P>
   Academy President Bob Rehme said another batch of Oscars was
made in case the missing ones were not located in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough for three years,'' he said. ``I think you can
rest assured this won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Gerloff, security manager for Roadway Express, said the
company intends to pay the $50,000 reward once the investigation is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to pay the reward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Fulgear, the money couldn't come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he lost his job as a bakery mechanic in the mid-1980s
and the death of his wife shortly afterward, Fulgear has been alone
to raise his son, who is now 22.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Fulgear said his father helps everybody he comes across.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody is hungry, he gives them food,'' he said. ``That's
the way he is. He looks to help and please others more than
himself.''

60'S RIGHTS LEADER IS ARRESTED IN DEATH OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs to provide addititional background material) (sw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three days after he was accused of shooting to death
of a sheriff's deputy near downtown Atlanta, the former civil
rights leader who was known as H. Rap Brown was arrested on Monday
night in an Alabama field after an exchange of gunfire near the
small town of Whitehall, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Muslim cleric known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, he had been
the subject of a nationwide manhunt since Friday, when a Fulton
County Sheriff's deputy identified Al-Amin as the man who had shot
him and another deputy while they tried to serve him with an arrest
warrant Thursday night on minor charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the deputies, Ricky Kinchen, died Friday afternoon after
receiving several gunshot wounds from a high-powered assault rifle.
Aldranon English, the deputy who identified Al-Amin, was still
hospitalized on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Monday night, Atlanta Police Chief
Beverly Harvard said Al-Amin had been captured by federal marshals,
FBI agents, and deputies of the Lowndes County, Ala., sheriff's
department.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehall is a small town between Selma and Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews broadcast on local television stations, Bill
Imfeld, an FBI agent based in Mobile, Ala., said federal agents had
begun looking for Al-Amin in Whitehall all day after learning that
he had friends from the days when he associated with the Black
Panther party in the 1960s. After knocking on doors in the town,
several agents were fired on near a shed at about 5:30 p.m., and
then called in backup officers, Imfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and local law-enforcement agencies flooded the area with
officers, helicopters and dogs. Al-Amin had run into a field when
the dogs found him, Imfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dogs were turned loose, they flushed out H. Rap
Brown, and he ran right into the arms of a waiting sheriff,''
Imfeld said. Al-Amin was arrested about 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said several people in the Whitehall area had been
detained on the possibility that they may have been harboring
Al-Amin as a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   She said that a handgun had been found in the field where
Al-Amin was caught, but she did not know if it had been used in the
Atlanta shooting. Officers did not find the assault rifle that had
been used in the shooting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett described herself as
ecstatic that Al-Amin had been caught before the funeral, scheduled
for Tuesday, of Kinchen. English was extremely relieved the suspect
had been caught, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I can sleep,'' she quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was in custody in the FBI office in Montgomery, Imfeld
said, where he would probably be charged on Tuesday and then
transported to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard would not comment on reports that the FBI may have
tracked down Al-Amin through the use of electronic wiretaps and
cellular phone transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when he was stopped by a police officer in suburban
Atlanta while driving a car that turned out to be stolen, Al-Amin
claimed to be a police officer in Whitehall, and flashed a badge he
said was from the Whitehall police department. But he was unable to
name the chief of police there, and was charged with impersonating
an officer, among other violations.
</P>
<P>
   After he failed to show up in court, a warrant was issued for
his arrest, which the deputies were serving when they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   As H. Rap Brown, Al-Amin was one of the best-known and most
confrontational black militants of the 1960s and 1970s. He spent
several years underground after being accused of inciting a riot
and transporting a gun across state lines while under indictment.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with inciting a riot in Cambridge, Md., in 1967
after he told a crowd of about 400, ``It's time for Cambridge to
explode, baby. Black folks built America, and if America don't come
around, we're going to burn America down.'' Afterward, Brown was
wounded and a police officer were wounded when gunfire broke out
between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the
1960s, he was known for proclaiming that ``violence is as American
as cherry pie.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving five years behind bars in New York on a robbery
charge, he converted to Islam, changed his name and moved to
Atlanta in 1976, where he has lived in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   He disappeared after the Thursday night shooting, leaving behind
a bewildered flock of followers in the largely black Atlanta
neighborhood called the West End, who said Al-Amin had renounced
violence when he formed the mosque and began working with community
groups to clean up the area.
</P>
<P>
   He was chosen to be the imam, or prayer leader, of his mosque,
and later became a prominent figure in Orthodox Muslim circles in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's arrest, FBI agents had feared Al-Amin might stay
in hiding for some time because of his experience on the run, and
because of what they called a large network of supporters across
the country who could hide him.

L.A. SCHOOL CROWDING TO WORSEN AS CONVERSION PLAN DERAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A sweeping plan to ease overcrowding by converting
middle schools to high schools won't work at many campuses, Los
Angeles Unified officials said Monday, raising the specter that the
district's classroom shortage could worsen.
</P>
<P>
   While the school district hasn't ruled out the possibility of
converting some campuses, the idea has proved too complex and
unpopular with parents to work on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   That means Los Angeles Unified will need to build even more
schools than previously planned, with estimates soaring from 100 to
150 and now even higher. The exact number has yet to be determined
but overcrowding at existing schools _ many of them already packed
with portable classrooms and operating on multitrack schedules _
will grow until the construction program gets into gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the magic bullet,'' school board member Caprice
Young said of the plan to convert middle schools. ``It isn't going
to save us.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the neighborhoods Young represents, North Hollywood, was
supposed to be the plan's first test. Last fall, Chief Operating
Officer Howard Miller proposed turning two North Hollywood middle
schools into high schools, rearranging seven elementaries to
include grades four through eight and building 11 small primary
centers to handle kindergarten through grade three.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, Miller said, would allow the district to house a
growing high school population without needing to find and buy the
large parcels of land required for a secondary school campus.
</P>
<P>
   But fierce opposition from parents and other complications
forced officials to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   At James Madison Middle School in North Hollywood, parents
complained about placing fourth-grade students on the campus with
much older children in grade eight. At Sun Valley Middle School,
district officials worried that a nearby landfill could cause
environmental problems if the school expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always an option that depended on finding the right
locations and community input, and it turns out the community
opposition was considerable,'' Miller said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Without the changes _ or new high schools _ the eastern San
Fernando Valley will have about 5,620 more high school students
than existing campuses can handle by 2006. Miller said the
district's staff hopes to present, in the next few weeks, more
options for easing overcrowding in the area's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district also encountered stiff resistance to its school
conversion plan in South Gate, where the school board's decision to
abandon a contaminated site for a future high school only
exacerbated a serious classroom shortage.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 parents attended one community meeting on the plan,
and most of those who spoke were critical of converting schools to
meet growing enrollment demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelmingly rejected by the parents,'' Assistant
Superintendent Gordon Wohlers said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the district has shifted its emphasis to finding
alternative sites for new South Gate schools. That policy will
apply to other schools as well.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, when Miller presents the school board with ways to
replace the now abandoned Belmont Learning Center downtown,
converting middle schools won't be one of them. The district needs
to construct 5,000 new classroom seats for students and Miller has
identified possible locations for 18,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Although board members and others initially praised the idea's
creativity, it has proved difficult to implement. Many middle
schools simply don't have the space needed for a comprehensive high
school, lacking adequate science labs or sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also posed instructional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sol Bialeck, assistant principal of Madison Middle School,
worried that the changes would destroy middle schools by lumping
those grades in with others. Students at that age, Bialeck said,
are undergoing significant changes and need a school specifically
focused on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sacrifice educational soundness for the need
to have a building,'' Bialeck said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   District officials said the conversion idea remains a
possibility in places where it would make sense and that it is
still an option in North Hollywood. But it no longer appears to be
the kind of large-scale solution many had hoped it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an alternative,'' Wohlers said, ``but it's an alternative
only when all other options have been exhausted.''
</P>

AFTER LAKERS BEAT HEAT, EVEN JACKSON IMPRESSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a season in which the Lakers have made few
concessions to the powers of the NBA, their coach has made even
fewer concessions regarding his own team's awesome potential.
</P>
<P>
   Predict a championship? Never.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadow even a finals appearance? No.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil Jackson is starting to give in. He has little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after Monday night, when the Lakers overcame a
15-point deficit and used a dominant second half to put down the
Miami Heat 100-89 before 20,075 at American Airlines Arena. And
this, just 24 hours after the Lakers beat the New York Knicks at
Madison Square Garden _ as impressive a back-to-back set of
victories as there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making me a believer,'' Jackson said. ``This team is
really making me a believer.''
</P>
<P>
   He joins a growing legion. Jackson's team won 4 of 5 on this
road trip, has now won 22 of its last 23 games to improve its
league-best record to 56-12, and extended its lead over Portland to
five games.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers are winning converts at every turn, that must make
Shaquille O'Neal the Big Proselytizer. O'Neal led the Lakers with
28 points and 12 rebounds, but it was his four blocks of Alonzo
Mourning _ all in a four-minute span to open the third quarter _
that turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had trailed 57-42, and O'Neal had been hampered by
three first-half fouls. But his defensive crush ignited a 22-2 run
that gave the Lakers a 64-59 lead and the momentum that carried
them to the win. O'Neal scored eight points in the run, while Kobe
Bryant added seven and finished with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to wake up,'' O'Neal said. ``I know I had to wake
up personally. I was tired in the first half, then I woke up,
somebody ticked me off, so I had to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal didn't identify the culprit, but Mourning was a good
candidate after scoring 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting in the first
half on his way to a 33-point night. More likely, it was the
officials who slapped O'Neal with the early fouls and later ejected
teammate Rick Fox for a verbal spat with referee Derek Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, O'Neal responded. The Lakers won the third
quarter 33-14 and never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille, with the effort defensively out of the gate, was
impressive,'' said Fox. ``He controlled the paint and got three or
four blocks in a row there. I think he set up a tone going down the
stretch, that there was not going to be the easy play in the paint.
That changes (the Heat's) confidence level on that side of the
court when they see their leader being controlled the way Shaquille
was controlling him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat was also battling through injuries _ P.J. Brown and
Otis Thorpe didn't dress, and Dan Majerle was hobbled and
ineffective. Yet it was the Lakers, perhaps battling some fatigue
playing their fourth road game in five days, who stumbled out of
the gate.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed the Heat to shot 56.4 percent in the first half
while falling to a 55-42 halftime deficit ``We did everything wrong
defensively in the first half,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were challenged at halftime as a basketball team to play
better basketball than we got mired into in the second quarter, ''
Jackson said. ``Shaquille came out and played a great defensive
quarter against Alonzo and just turned the momentum around in the
ballgame. ... And for a fourth game in five nights, that was a
terrific effort by these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The final piece was Glen Rice, the former Heat star who again
scorched his former team with 28 points on 7-of-15 shooting,
including 3 of 6 from the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's no coincidence at all,'' said Rice, who scored 23
points when the Lakers beat the Heat in L.A. two weeks ago. ``I
just try and go out here and give my best performance. At times
they leave me open when they shouldn't. That's kind of hard to
believe at times, but I'm happy for it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Jackson now believes his team has something special. His
team wonders what took so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a believer. The Big Believer,'' O'Neal
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely have always been confident amongst
ourselves in this locker room, '' said Fox. ``But that's a nice
compliment coming from the coach, when you ... take it to another
level and prove to him in his mind that we're definitely
improving.'' &QL;

DE LA HOYA - MOSLEY WILL BE L.A.'S BIGGEST PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the moment, it seems, Los Angeles is the
center of the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya, one of the sport's biggest names, and Shane
Mosley, one of its brightest talents, formally announced Monday at
Staples Center that the homegrown rivals will meet on June 17 at
the new downtown arena in what will be the biggest-money fight in
the history of California.
</P>
<P>
   Also, promoter Bob Arum announced that he is negotiating to
stage three !ital!more!off! boxing cards featuring big-name
fighters the same weekend at other sites in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   All that, combined with the prospect of the Lakers playing in
the NBA Finals at that time, could turn downtown into an
energy-packed sports circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an exciting thing for L.A. fans,'' said De La
Hoya, who will defend the WBC welterweight belt he was formally
awarded on Monday. ``This is history, the very first fight at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big. I'm very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight is significant purely in boxing terms.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (32-1, with 26 knockouts) and Mosley (34-0, 32 KOs)
are two of the best fighters in the world and in the prime of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, from East L.A., is rebuilding his image somewhat
after a disappointing loss to Felix Trinidad in September, while
Mosley, from Pomona, is hungry to build a bigger name for himself
and claim a bigger share of boxing's sizable monetary pie.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact the WBC handed De La Hoya the belt he lost to
Trinidad which Trinidad gave up when he won the WBA junior
middleweight title and De La Hoya reclaimed when he knocked out
Derrell Coley in January only adds drama to the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored to accept the belt,'' De La Hoya said. ``Just one
thing, though: On June 17, I will !ital!officially!off! consider
myself champion of this belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big fight. It'll go to the best man.''
</P>
<P>
   That the fight is in Los Angeles completes a particularly
fascinating picture for local fans.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. area is starved for big-time boxing. It hasn't seen a
fight of this magnitude since the late 1960s and early '70s, when
popular Mexican fighters performed regularly at packed local
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   And no fight even approaches this one in terms of money: Gate
receipts could exceed $8 million if the arena sells out, which
would dwarf the previous high of approximately $700,000 for the
1990 bout between Tony Lopez and Jorge Paez in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya will earn $8 million, Mosley $4.5 million, although
both could make more if pay-per-view sales go well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money is a motivating factor for the fighters.
However, both also find gratification in the fact the fight will
take place in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who hasn't fought in L.A. since he knocked out John
Avila on Dec. 10, 1994, has been angling to get back here since.
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley, one might think that the site of the fight would be
insignificant compared to its magnitude because this is the big
break he's waited for since he turned pro in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's been all but lost in the glow of De La Hoya's superstardom
in this town. He wants to show local boxing fans what they've been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be in L.A.,'' he said. ``I think the fans, the
crowd need to see what I'm really about, they !ital!deserve!off! to
see what I'm about. I don't know if they understand how good I
really am.
</P>
<P>
   ``... They should know there's another great fighter in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Leiweke, president of Staples, has said that this fight in
large part will determine whether Staples will bring big-time
boxing to L.A. on a regular basis. He wants to see no empty seats,
an exciting card and an electric atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   For now, both he and Arum are bursting with optimism that this
is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what's happening now,'' Arum said. ``(WBC lightweight
champion) Steve Johnston fights in his hometown of Denver last
Friday and the place sells out, every ticket gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``... The same thing will happen here. Two local guys, two
world-class fighters at the Staples Center. It's going to sell out.
It's a natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``For boxing to flourish, we have to, to a large extent, take
boxing out of the casinos and bring it into the arenas where people
can afford to watch the events.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The additional card on Friday will be televised by ESPN2
while afternoon cards Saturday and Sunday will be on ABC, Arum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arum and Leiweke said the Olympic Auditorium and the 2,000-seat
Variety Arts Center a few blocks from Staples are possible sites,
although a Variety Arts spokesman said it hasn't been determined
whether the building is logistically suited for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said WBA bantamweight champ Paulie Ayala and Johnston could
headline the smaller cards.
</P>
<P>
   Also, WBC junior featherweight titleholder Erik Morales is
expected to fight on the De La Hoya-Mosley undercard.
</P>
<P>
   The De La Hoya-Mosley card will take place in the ring used for
so many years at the Forum. &QL;

PEPPERDINE HOPES THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The irony is that Jan van Breda Kolff's
Vanderbilt teams played a slow-down, grind-it-out style on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly the same system that Pepperdine players resisted under
Lorenzo Romar.
</P>
<P>
   But van Breda Kolff never considered that type of game for the
Waves. At Vanderbilt, his team lacked depth and speed, two
necessities for a fast-paced, pressing system.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he wouldn't have that problem at Pepperdine, which says
a lot about van Breda Kolff. When he replaced Romar in April, he
looked at the Waves roster and crafted a plan to take advantage of
the team's quickness, size and depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he let us play,'' point guard Tezale Archie said.
``It's a style that suits us best, being from the West Coast and
wanting to run. And the guys enjoy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what kind of difference (van Breda Kolff) has made,''
Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Romar wanted the Waves to grind games to halfcourt sets and
pound the ball into the post. Two players Jelani Gardner and Gibbs
provided most of the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a good team, but it was like a slugfest,'' Archie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed under van Breda Kolff, the Waves won a school-record
number of games (25-9) this season, won the regular-season West
Coast Conference championship, gained an at-large berth into the
NCAA Tournament and shocked Indiana 77-57 in the first round of the
East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine fell 75-67 to Oklahoma State in the second round
Sunday, but as disappointing as the loss was, the Waves made great
strides this year. The key now is taking advantage of the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the foundation returns next year, including
leading scorer Brandon Armstrong (14.1), starting forward Kelvin
Gibbs (nine points, eight rebounds) and key reserves Craig Lewis
and David Lalazarian.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has NBA-type ability, is able to shoot from the
outside and get to the basket by beating his defender on drives. He
needs to get stronger and be more consistent, but his future is
bright.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs sacrificed offense this year to play a more versatile
role. Next year he'll get more scoring opportunities in the low
post, where his size and strength are a plus. Lewis and Lalazarian
came off the bench, and both are in line for starting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves are also high on sophomore center Cedric Suitt (6-10)
and freshman forward Boomer Brazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's success in Buffalo created name recognition for the
program, and that awareness should increase its stature among high
school recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really know much about Pepperdine outside of the
West Coast and California, other than when Ken Starr was on
(television) a lot,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``Now that we're on
national (television) and in the NCAAs winning games, maybe we can
do some recruiting in the regional areas of the West Coast, start
to get some kids from the East Coast and the Midwest. That will be
an exciting situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be holes to fill. Archie, who developed into a
trusted leader, graduates, as do starters Nick Sheppard and Tommie
Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine hopes to minimize those losses with the players
coming back, plus two gifted recruits who the Waves secured in the
early signing period. Forwards Robert Turner (Anaheim Western High)
and Will Kimble (San Bernardino Pacific) are expected to make
immediate contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff envisions a consistently powerful program, the
type that can compete nationally every year. By adding players such
as Turner and Kimble, he may be on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed two (recruits) early that are very good players and
we're involved with a few other excellent players,'' van Breda
Kolff said. ``I think they could really put us in the top 25 range.
If we can get those guys, hopefully we can be a powerhouse on the
West Coast.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers, who seem a bit light on heart,
courage and basketball smarts, thought they had a remedy:
</P>
<P>
   They scheduled a Monday night house call from the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Their next move should be suing for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Before 11,443 in the waiting room known as Staples Center, the
Clips were pronounced defeated, 105-93, by the 23-45 powerhouse
from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (14-54) rolled over against the Wizards by
following the standard format.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I see us winning,'' said Clippers interim coach
Jim Todd, ``is playing defense and shooting over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The only place to see such activity may be the Psychic Hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Todd's team had to play without one of its heroes;
this time it was rookie Lamar Odom (strained right calf). They also
had another cozy, first-quarter lead (23-15 at the 2:05 mark) that
was discarded so that they might spend the second half eating dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole key to everything was not having Lamar,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   And the unexpected Washington depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were served a second-quarter slice of humiliation
by the Wizards' bench, which produced a decisive 17-0 run.
Sub-Wizards Tracy Murray (9 points), Chris Whitney (9), Aaron
Williams (6), Richard Hamilton (4) and Don Reid (3) teamed up for
all 31 of Washington's points in that period. Reid, claimed off the
waiver wire from Detroit last week, finished the game with 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   Reid as secret weapon?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a new phrase used with my name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wizards' bench went berserk, the mighty Clippers
finished the second quarter with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting team had a 55-39 advantage at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby scored 20 points to lead the home team. Maurice
Taylor, with less than a month remaining on his Clipper expiration
date, had 15 and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And it was almost fun for a moment or two.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby's lay-up at 9:40 of the first quarter made it 8-0
Clippers. His 3-point bomb made 23-15 at 2:05.
</P>
<P>
   But a 3 by Whitney at 9:40 of the second stanza finally pulled
Washington even at 31.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Clippers scored again, Washington led by a
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards' offense was paced by Mitch Richmond, who bagged 13
of his game-high 21 points in the third quarter. Washington pushed
its lead to 68-49 at 6:51 in that period, but the Clippers rallied
to trail 78-70 leading into round four.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Chilcutt scored 7 points off the bench in that quarter,
which was won by the Clips 31-23.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't even bother teasing anyone with a fourth-quarter
rally, and Taylor limped to the locker room on a sprained left
ankle at slightly under 4 minutes before it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just dug ourselves too deep of a hole,'' said Todd, whose
team had the decency to throw the dirt on itself.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Atlanta Tipoff Club selected Clippers assistant coach
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the Naismith College Basketball Player of
the 20th Century. Abdul-Jabbar, who led UCLA to three national
championships as Lew Alcindor, was chosen by a panel of coaches,
journalists and administrators. &QL;

DE LA HOYA-MOSLEY A BIG GAMBLE FOR STAPLES CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I don't know Tim Leiweke from Tim Robbins or Tim
Conway, but I do know this much about the clean-cut,
youthful-looking, 42-year-old president of Staples Center: he isn't
fearful of taking a risk.
</P>
<P>
   He has plunged feet first into one of the more dangerous
businesses in America _ professional boxing _ quite aware that it
is a field littered with promotional corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sleeping very well at night these days,'' claims Leiweke,
the driving force behind bringing the Oscar De La Hoya-Sugar Shane
Mosley welterweight title fight to the new Los Angeles arena on
June 17.
</P>
<P>
   That's a surprising development for a guy who has guaranteed the
promoter of the event, Bob Arum, a minimum $5 million payoff, come
rain, shine or a lousy turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fight is going to do 8 million dollars at the box
office, and I think half of the tickets will be gone by the end of
the week,'' says Leiweke confidently. ``That means we already will
have pocketed $4 million. And I expect by fight time, all the
tickets will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural attraction for L.A. Two great fighters from
the area. You wouldn't believe how many ticket requests we've
already received from people in the entertainment industry. I
realize the risks involved. We could blow millions. But that won't
happen. Oscar's a great draw.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Oscar De La Hoya such a great draw since his fadeout
against Felix Trinidad?
</P>
<P>
   Was he ever a great draw at the box office without a Julio Cesar
Chavez, or Felix Trinidad as an opponent?
</P>
<P>
   Pay per view phenomenon, yes, but fistic aficionados haven't
exactly stormed the turnstiles to buy expensive tickets to watch
him fight. And many of those people who have sat in ringside seats
at his Las Vegas matches were high-rollers who had their tickets
purchased for them by the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, De La Hoya did draw a huge crowd once in El Paso for his
three-round farce with Patrick Charpentier, but the tickets prices
were minimal and not faintly comparable to the $900, $700, $500,
$300, $100 and $50 price scale that Arum has established for De La
Hoya's debate with Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke is oozing with unrestrained optimism, and that's
understandable in the wake of the stunning success his arena
already has enjoyed since its opening last October 17, with
sellouts being routine for the Lakers, as well as for the Grammy
Awards, Bruce Springsteen, the Eagles, Cher, Bette Midler, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be the top entertainment venue in the
entertainment capital of the world,'' says Leiweke. ``We just feel
to reach that plateau you have to also get involved in boxing. We'd
like to have at least two major boxing shows a year.''
</P>
<P>
   That might turn out to be the case, but Tim Leiweke has to
realize that boxing is a sport that has a sacred history of leaving
brash newcomers with bright hopes disillusioned and drenched in red
ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried a bit,'' says Leiweke.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Bob Arum, a sly fiscal operator whose deal with
Staples also assures him of getting 75 percent of the gate receipts
after he banks the first $5 million from tickets sales and after
Staples takes out for its expenses that's expected to be in the $1
million range.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Leiweke might be right when he says half of the tickets
might be peddled by the weekend especially the 5,500 ones going for
$50 and $100 but getting rid of those next 10,000 might pose a
problem and make him and those people bankrolling him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Staples will encounter too many obstacles getting rid of
the quality $900 tickets, but who in their right mind will fork out
$700, or $500, or even $300 to watch De La Hoya after his ignoble
retreat against Trinidad?
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is a quality fighter with exciting skills, and the former
lightweight champion figures to seriously challenge De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   But Mosley doesn't exactly have a passionate following like
Trinidad or Chavez, and there is still skepticism among many fight
fans about his moving up 12 pounds in such a brief time _ he began
fighting at 147 only last September _ to face someone the caliber
of De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Tim Leiweke knows something I don't know, and that there
are tons of people out there set to gobble up all those $700 and
$500 tickets to assure Staples Center of not suffering a severe
financial setback.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters certainly won't.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is being guaranteed $8 million, and will get a
percentage of all the other various goodies connected to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar's take could go as high as $20 million,'' said Bob
Arum's roly-poly mouthpiece, Bill (Bozo) Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is being guaranteed $4.5 million, with a percentage of
the pay per view proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar Shane could wind up with $8 million,'' said Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if the fight turnout is as large as the fight press
conference turnout was Monday afternoon at Staples Center _ it had
to be the best-attended one I can recall in L.A. _ then Bob Arum
and Tim Leiweke might, incredibly, still be warm friends after the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was on their best behavior at the event, and the
typical hyperbole by Bob Arum _ ``this is going to be the biggest
non-heavyweight pay per view show in boxing history'' _ left you
absolutely breathless with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was in prime rhetorical form, saying he would be in
the best shape of his life, saying he was not going to run away
from Mosley, saying he had a New Year's Day epiphany in which he
had come to his senses and would ``fight like I used to fight when
my best defense was my offense.''
</P>
<P>
   I've heard it all before, and you can be sure when the fight
starts against Mosley that ol' Oscar will do what he does best _
stick, move, attack once in a while and keep himself at a safe
distance to avoid as much as he can getting hit.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the fight would be a Alexis Arguello-Aaron Pryor-like
classic if De La Hoya doesn't retreat because Mosley certainly
won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm preparing for a war and I will go after Oscar,'' promises
Mosley, and I believe him.
</P>
<P>
   But I have a hard time believing that Staples Center will sell
out for this one, especially with the most reliable ticket buyers
in America _ the Las Vegas casinos _ staying on the sidelines. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ ``If only there was woman candidate we could vote for.
The men have made quite enough of a mess in this country with their
aggression, their drunkenness and their corruption. A woman could
hardly do any worse. I would give her a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was Pavel, a middle-aged man, talking about the
dearth of inspiring politicians in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If he thought like that, imagine how the millions of
still-downtrodden Russian women felt after all the disappointments
of former President Boris Yeltsin's flawed rule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this weekend's upcoming presidential elections, they do
have a woman for whom they can vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although, because of Chechnya and the way the establishment has
backed him, acting President Vladimir Putin has a huge advantage in
the election on March 26, it is inaccurate to say that voters are
deprived of choice.
</P>
<P>
   There are no fewer than 11 other candidates, among whom is the
first woman to run for the Russian presidency, the liberal reformer
and former social affairs minister, 46-year-old Ella Pamfilova.
</P>
<P>
   If she won the Kremlin, she would be the first woman to rule
Russia since the Empress Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, on the eve of International Women's Day,
when Russian women receive token attention from their sexist men,
Pamfilova held a press conference to launch her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant in black velvet in keeping with her soft image, avoiding
any suggestion of strident feminism, she called for ``capitalism
with a human face.'' In 1968 the doomed Czechoslovak leader,
Alexander Dubcek, sought to improve the imperfect system in his
country by advocating ``socialism with a human face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the economy is important and we should not be thinking of
reversing privatization,'' Pamfilova said, ``but in the process of
market reform, we have not cared enough about human beings. This
has led to national degradation and a sense of hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must invest in job creation, education and science so that
we can compete in the modern world. If we learn to respect
ourselves, others will respect us. But if our social decline
continues, no amount of military might will save us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the resources we need to get up off our knees by
our own efforts. Russia is a rich country and we simply do not have
the right to live as poorly as we do now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which would be music to the ears of doctors, teachers,
scientists, librarians and artists, the natural middle class
reduced to poverty in the Yeltsin years and the kind of people
Pamfilova sees as her constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova, an electronic engineer, first entered politics in
1989 when the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, abolished the
monopoly of the Communist Party and allowed for the election of a
semi-democratic parliament that included some independent MPs.
</P>
<P>
   After Boris Yeltsin defeated the coup in August 1991, Pamfilova
joined his first reforming government as minister for social
affairs. Her personal struggle was always against ``the
indifference of bureaucrats'' and ``the unfairness of privileges,''
a battle that Yeltsin also fought in his early, energetic days.
</P>
<P>
   But while the now-retired Russian leader allowed power to
corrupt him, Pamfilova remained loyal to her ideals. Today she
lives in nothing more luxurious than a two-room apartment with her
husband, daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first war in Chechnya from 1994-1996 that prompted
Pamfilova to go into opposition against her president. She stayed
on in parliament, campaigning against deputies' rights to immunity
from prosecution and taking part last year in the unsuccessful
attempt to impeach Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Duma elections last December, she lost her seat as
the ``bears'' of the new Unity Party packed parliament to support
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's first woman presidential candidate admitted that she
had virtually no chance of winning the election but said she had
reason to hope for third or fourth place, which might inspire
younger Russian women coming up behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel said he would be voting for Pamfilova, at least in the
first round of the election. But the women of Russia, who should be
showing her solidarity, looked as if they would betray their
pioneering sister.
</P>
<P>
   They were all going weak at the knees about Putin, described by
one Russian actress as a ``real man.''
</P>
<P>
   On Women's Day, the acting president adopted his softest
``father of the nation'' tone of voice when he said that Russian
women were held back in many ways but had one advantage: ``their
absolute right to be protected by men.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a brave man, or a foolish one, to step between mortal
enemies spoiling for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton may be the leader of the world's most powerful
country but, if he puts a foot wrong during his tour of India this
week and his brief touchdown in Pakistan, he could exacerbate the
tensions that last year brought these two sibling states to blows
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, however carefully Clinton treads, the tensions may well
come to breaking point again in a few months' time, as the winter
snows melt along Kashmir's increasingly misnamed line of control.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of war between these two novice nuclear powers has
America's diplomats desperately reaching for instruments to promote
good-neighborliness _ but finding little to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can expect no diplomatic souvenirs for touring South
Asia either (he will also visit Bangladesh).
</P>
<P>
   India will not humor him with pledges of nuclear or missile
restraint, or even a minimal concession such as its belated
signature on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (though both India
and Pakistan may sign the CTBT eventually).
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Pakistan's military-led government shows no sign
either of handing back power to civilians or of being willing to
rein in the Islamic insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   When this took the form of an infiltration by militants at
Kargil last year, the result was a spectacular end to the earlier
efforts to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
   The best Clinton can hope to do now is to remind both India and
Pakistan that they have much more to gain by shaking hands than by
shaking fists. That gets harder as the two countries' economies
drift apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, income per person in the subcontinent was similar
to Southeast Asia's; it then fell far behind. But India has started
to pull itself out of its state-planned hole.
</P>
<P>
   Previously blessed with more democracy than good government, it
has recently started to accept the enriching value of
privatization, competition and freer trade.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of its history and of its higher-tech future, India's
ambition is to be a world-class power with a seat on the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, by contrast, is falling apart. Venal politicians have
sucked the country hollow, leaving the void to be filled by Islamic
extremists, or military coup-makers, with troubling signs of
alliances between the two.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is primitive, corrupt and weakening by the day.
Pakistan badly needs foreign aid if it is not to implode. Yet its
military-dominated government and its violent meddling in Kashmir
make it a frustratingly hard place to help.
</P>
<P>
   Stung, not just by Pakistan's Kargil incursion, but also by the
hijacking in December of an Indian Airlines jet by Islamic
extremists from organizations supported by the Pakistani regime,
India is doing all it can to isolate and ignore Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   That is the second of the government's two big mistakes. The
first was the detonation of five nuclear bombs in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   India's Hindu-nationalist-led government trumpets its nuclear
prowess as a source of Hindu and national pride. Since economic
revival will take a lot more sweat, tears and time, the bomb tests
were also meant to be a shortcut to greater world prominence. Yet
India refuses to count the cost of measuring its worth in military
plutonium, rather than industrial silicon.
</P>
<P>
   One is the development spending forgone as a result of the huge
cost of building nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them.
That is in addition to last month's 28 percent increase in the
defense budget, ascribed to the need for better defenses in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   These two burdens are more closely linked than the Indian
government likes to admit. Tit-for-tat testing handed
conventionally weaker Pakistan a great equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Its present leader, General Pervez Musharraf, thinks he can now
make mischief in Kashmir with impunity. He assumes Pakistan's bomb
will both deter India from striking back hard and also force India
to accept mediation over Kashmir from worried outsiders like
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He is wrong. America will no doubt do its best, as it has
before, to pull India and Pakistan back from a fight. But that will
do nothing to solve the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Should that dispute come to war, it will be because India's
nuclear folly has been matched by a fatal Pakistani miscalculation
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, far from raising itself above South Asia's
poverty and insecurity, India has put its future at even greater
risk from a failing, nuclear-armed Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   It need not be that way. The two have far more to gain from
mutual trade than from armed hostility. But for their leaders to
say as much would take political courage that is at present beyond
them.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be hoped for now is a cooling-off period to
reintroduce a measure of predictability in dealing with the two
most dangerous issues: nuclear weapons and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   As a lame-duck president, unable to get the CTBT through the
Senate, Clinton is not well placed to win concessions from India.
But he comes ready to offer a new start in relations _ one that has
inevitably been delayed by the nuclear tests _ which India also
wants.
</P>
<P>
   This is Clinton's chance to make clear that, for relations to
flourish, at a minimum there must be responsible management of the
nuclear genie India has unleashed. For India, as for Pakistan, that
means no exporting know-how, no testing new weapons, but instead
exploring ways to avoid stumbling inadvertently into nuclear war. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is still the most likely trigger of such a war. As one
of Pakistan's few friends, America needs to lean on General
Musharraf to adhere to past agreements with India by which both
countries vow not to try to change the status quo by force.
</P>
<P>
   As for India, past misrule in Kashmir has both weakened its case
for running the place and stoked the discontent that allows
Pakistan-backed extremism to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   India will have to talk to Pakistan about Kashmir eventually.
When that time comes, India will be in a stronger position if it
has already made peace with its own Kashmiri people. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problems between India and Pakistan are difficult, not
insoluble. Clinton can at least remind them of that. &QL;

<P>
   The Indian high-tech boom is one of the great under-publicized
stories of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   For many years the Indian subcontinent has produced talented
computer people who did, in general, head off to the developed
world to make their fortunes. Silicon Valley in California is
attracting upwards of 50,000 of them a year.
</P>
<P>
   True, there was an established software business in India,
located principally around Bangalore, but as recently as 1995
Indian software exports were only $300 million a year. This was
despite the fact that Indian programmers are paid less than half
the rate they would et in the U.S., and are of higher quality too.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure this by counting the errors made in lines of
code and apparently Indian programmers make only one-third as many
mistakes as their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, however, the Indian high-technology
sector has moved up a gear. Last year Indian software exports were
nearly $3 billion _ ten times the level of four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Four things account for this takeoff. Most obviously there is
the Internet, which has both increased demand for computer skills
and make people aware that they can buy such skills from anywhere
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given a simple online delivery mechanism for
software, which in theory existed before but in practice has become
much easier. Expect this to grow as demand for the Internet booms
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003 it looks as though there will be more Internet users in
Asia than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there was the Millennium Bug. Fixing it demanded vast
amounts of competent computer programming time. India could deliver
that in abundance and buyers have now discovered that the people
they thought they had brought in to fix problems could now help
them do much more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem proved a blessing, for it gave these people an
entree into companies that they would never have got into
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is the emergence of English as the default language
of the world. Other less developed countries can offer computer
skills, but frequently there is a language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Few can offer the combination of English and technical
competence. As a result it is not just programmers that are in
demand: India is becoming a call-center, handling the nighttime
calls for a number of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   This night shift does not just apply to voice traffic. The
development of a true 24-hour world economy has created a demand
for a computer night-shift.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. computer workload can be passed at the end of the
working day to Indian operators who can carry on the software
development _ or simply fix problems _ before America wakes up. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia needs a strong leader, able to get laws passed and
obeyed, and institutions built, rebuilt or cleansed of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, its new president, seems a strong, determined
man, supported since parliamentary elections in December by a
fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing a fine chance of
being elected as president in the popular vote on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   So Putin is just what the Russian doctor ordered? Not so fast.
Before jumping to that conclusion, it is as well to review what is
known about this man and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of a secretive, clannish place, Putin's
background is fairly clear but that still does not make him
well-known. The trouble is that the few facts that are available
reveal little about his political inclinations or his ideas about
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became prime minister last August, and especially since
becoming president on Jan. 1, he has made sure to offer reassuring
noises to all the appropriate constituencies: to sound democratic
to democrats, reform-minded to reformers, tough to tough-guys,
reasonably western to reasonable westerners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not what he says that matters. It is what he does. And
most of the significant things that he has done, both in his short
career as a political leader and in his longer career as a spy,
have been scary.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that longer career that the worries begin. In any
country, it would be hard to imagine the former head of the
domestic counterintelligence service becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush may have been head of America's CIA, but that was a
political appointment and he was not a career spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, you might argue, everyone who is anyone has a dodgy
background of some sort, given seven decades of communism. And in
lawless Russia, to have the trust of the secret police and the army
will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But a more sinister interpretation is just as
plausible. For much of this year, the role and influence of the
secret police and the army have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated by Russia's failed war in Chechnya in 1994-96,
derided around the globe for years as a clapped out bunch of
incompetents, the Russian army has long been looking for a way to
restore its pride and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's NATO offensive in Kosovo left Russia looking both
unprepared and fourth-rate, apparently incapable of defending
interests or standing by allies. This was an exaggeration, but one
the security services and the military appear to have exploited to
begin their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Then, following the incursion by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Dagestan in the summer came a series of deadly bomb explosions in
Moscow and other Russian cities. This was the beginning, remember,
of Putin's rise to power and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   No clear evidence has yet been found for who was responsible for
those bombs, and no one has claimed responsibility. Chechen rebels,
which include some pretty nasty characters, may well have been the
culprits. But, in the absence of evidence, other candidates should
also be kept in mind.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the very service that Putin used to head, once
the core of the KGB and now called the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that it laid the bombs, either. Yet given
the huge benefits that he, and the security forces in general, have
gained from those tragedies it would be foolish to rule that
thought out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that this possibility needs to be weighed in
any assessment of what a long-term President Putin might be like.
</P>
<P>
   In a different way, the manner of President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation was also ominous.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that it was long overdue; Yeltsin would have
done his country a service by standing down at least two years ago.
But there is also a lot of doubt over whether he really wanted to
stand down even six months before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to protect him and his family from prosecution for
corruption, struck with a powerful prospect in the forthcoming
elections, may be explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not look terribly voluntary, and despite gestures of
change in the Kremlin (such as the ostentatious sidelining of
Yeltsin's daughter) the signs are that the same court of business
oligarchs and security toughs will be running things in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was, at least in his last years, their puppet. Which end
of the strings Putin holds remains to be seen. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, better possibilities. Out of the
Putin-strengthening evil of the Chechen war could come
institution-building, rule-of-law-enforcing, enterprise-creating
good.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin may indeed believe, as he says he does, in an
open society, with free speech, democratic liberties and pro-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to crush the Chechen rebels may, in due course, be
tempered by a realpolitik desire to stay on reasonable terms with
the Islamic world. His desire to stand up for Russia against the
West may be tempered by a realpolitik desire to keep open Russia's
access to foreign money and to avoid outright confrontations with
America. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests that outsiders and Russians alike should give
President Putin the benefit of the doubt. They should keep an open
mind, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the sobering truth is that the facts _ such
as they are, given that he is a former spymaster _ lean more
towards doubt than benefit. &QL;

Before jumping to that conclusion, it is as well to review what is
known about this man and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of a secretive, clannish place, Putin's
background is fairly clear but that still does not make him
well-known. The trouble is that the few facts that are available
reveal little about his political inclinations or his ideas about
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became prime minister last August, and especially since
becoming president on Jan. 1, he has made sure to offer reassuring
noises to all the appropriate constituencies: to sound democratic
to democrats, reform-minded to reformers, tough to tough-guys,
reasonably western to reasonable westerners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not what he says that matters. It is what he does. And
most of the significant things that he has done, both in his short
career as a political leader and in his longer career as a spy,
have been scary.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that longer career that the worries begin. In any
country, it would be hard to imagine the former head of the
domestic counterintelligence service becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush may have been head of America's CIA, but that was a
political appointment and he was not a career spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, you might argue, everyone who is anyone has a dodgy
background of some sort, given seven decades of communism. And in
lawless Russia, to have the trust of the secret police and the army
will be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But a more sinister interpretation is just as
plausible. For much of this year, the role and influence of the
secret police and the army have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated by Russia's failed war in Chechnya in 1994-96,
derided around the globe for years as a clapped out bunch of
incompetents, the Russian army has long been looking for a way to
restore its pride and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's NATO offensive in Kosovo left Russia looking both
unprepared and fourth-rate, apparently incapable of defending
interests or standing by allies. This was an exaggeration, but one
the security services and the military appear to have exploited to
begin their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Then, following the incursion by Chechen rebels into neighboring
Dagestan in the summer came a series of deadly bomb explosions in
Moscow and other Russian cities. This was the beginning, remember,
of Putin's rise to power and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   No clear evidence has yet been found for who was responsible for
those bombs, and no one has claimed responsibility. Chechen rebels,
which include some pretty nasty characters, may well have been the
culprits. But, in the absence of evidence, other candidates should
also be kept in mind.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the very service that Putin used to head, once
the core of the KGB and now called the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that it laid the bombs, either. Yet given
the huge benefits that he, and the security forces in general, have
gained from those tragedies it would be foolish to rule that
thought out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that this possibility needs to be weighed in
any assessment of what a long-term President Putin might be like.
</P>
<P>
   In a different way, the manner of President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation was also ominous.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that it was long overdue; Yeltsin would have
done his country a service by standing down at least two years ago.
But there is also a lot of doubt over whether he really wanted to
stand down even six months before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to protect him and his family from prosecution for
corruption, struck with a powerful prospect in the forthcoming
elections, may be explanation enough.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not look terribly voluntary, and despite gestures of
change in the Kremlin (such as the ostentatious sidelining of
Yeltsin's daughter) the signs are that the same court of business
oligarchs and security toughs will be running things in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was, at least in his last years, their puppet. Which end
of the strings Putin holds remains to be seen. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, better possibilities. Out of the
Putin-strengthening evil of the Chechen war could come
institution-building, rule-of-law-enforcing, enterprise-creating
good.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin may indeed believe, as he says he does, in an
open society, with free speech, democratic liberties and pro-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to crush the Chechen rebels may, in due course, be
tempered by a realpolitik desire to stay on reasonable terms with
the Islamic world. His desire to stand up for Russia against the
West may be tempered by a realpolitik desire to keep open Russia's
access to foreign money and to avoid outright confrontations with
America. &QL;

<P>

<P>
   All this suggests that outsiders and Russians alike should give
President Putin the benefit of the doubt. They should keep an open
mind, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the sobering truth is that the facts _ such
as they are, given that he is a former spymaster _ lean more
towards doubt than benefit. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Spies are good at concealing their motives. Presumably Vladimir
Putin, acting president of Russia since Jan. 1, most of whose
working life has been spent on active service for the KGB, is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Does he come to power with the bottled-up energies of a hitherto
frustrated reformer, determined to take Russia into Europe? There
is some evidence for it.
</P>
<P>
   Or does his heart lie in the paranoid, ruthless old world of the
Cold-War Soviet security services? There is evidence for that too.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he in reality a Kremlin insider, a crafty new-Russian
power-broker who revels in sleaze and arm-twisting? Also quite
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of these three faces could be the real Putin, the other
two just political disguises.
</P>
<P>
   The former spy's extraordinary rise to power certainly
demonstrates his ability to give his masters what they want:
loyalty, efficiency, and a polite nod of apparent agreement.
</P>
<P>
   What he himself really thinks, however, is the big question now
facing Russia and the world. What is clear is that Putin currently
enjoys both huge power, and huge popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Enfeebled by ill-health and public disdain, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, who announced his resignation on Dec. 31, rarely
used his constitutional powers to the full.
</P>
<P>
   Putin will be different. The war in Chechnya, which he has waged
with undisguised enthusiasm since becoming prime minister last
August, has been a great success with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential election on March 26 looks to be a formality,
with Yevgeny Primakov, Putin's main non-Communist rival, suffering
a seemingly fatal loss of support in early January as a big chunk
of his party swung behind the acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Even if things go badly thereafter, the world faces four years
with President Putin's finger on the nuclear button.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's official biography is sketchy, far more is
known about him than about most of the shadowy Kremlin henchmen _
chiefly Yeltsin's daughter and her friends _ who have in effect
been running Russia.
</P>
<P>
   One important Kremlin figure, an oil tycoon called Roman
Abramovich, is so camera-shy that when attention focused on him
last summer, one Russian newspaper offered a prize to anyone who
could unearth a photograph of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with Putin. For someone who affects reticence he
has proved remarkably camera-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Pictured the other day flooring his opponents in a judo contest,
he meets Russians' yearning for a leader who is physically fit:
Mikhail Gorbachev aside, they have not had one for years.
</P>
<P>
   In battle dress, visiting the front in Chechnya, for example, he
plays the military man. He takes care to appeal to liberals too,
meeting writers, criticizing the scandalous conditions in prisons,
and even laying flowers on the grave of Andrei Sakharov, the icon
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   On taking office, he declared encouragingly that free speech and
private property were the fundamentals of a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, not being one, does he sound like a politician. Putin
speaks in a clipped, matter-of-fact style, a world away from the
wordiness of Gorbachev, or Yeltsin's earthy and often incoherent
utterances. That goes down well too.
</P>
<P>
   So much for impressions. But what will his arrival in power mean
in practice? Putin's track record is so ambiguous that there are at
once grounds for hope, despair and panic.
</P>
<P>
   With his firm grip, he might well be the man to tackle Russia's
lawlessness, which is at the root of its economic misery; indeed,
on Jan. 6, he signed a decree ordering the security forces to
concentrate more on organized crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If gangsters were put in prison rather than in government, and
if corruption were the exception rather than the rule, and if
courts protected property rights, Russia's prospects would be
immeasurably brighter.
</P>
<P>
   Putin certainly has some of the necessary qualities. He
understands the dimensions of Russia's backwardness: it would take
GDP growth rates of 8 percent a year for 15 years, he noted
recently, just for Russians to reach the living standards the
Portuguese enjoy today.
</P>
<P>
   He has lived abroad, in his days as a spy probably crossing a
lot into West Germany from his base in Dresden, East Germany. And
he was a leading economic aide to the St. Petersburg municipality,
in its liberal heyday.
</P>
<P>
   That is all heartening as far as it goes. But his background
suggests that Putin may be keener on modernizing Russia than on
democratizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed head of the KGB's domestic successor, the Federal
Security Service, in August 1998, he revealed no enthusiasm for
reforming it. It retained its secretive and bullying habits _
tormenting environmentalists, for example _ while showing no zeal
for hunting down the assassins of Galina Staravoitova, a
human-rights leader gunned down in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For all his fluent German and time spent abroad, Putin's ideas
about the rest of the world seem pretty old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last December praising Russia's security services,
he declared: ``Several years ago we fell prey to an illusion that
we have no enemies. We paid dearly for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, he retreats into Soviet-style bombast. An
authoritarian is an unappetizing prospect for outsiders. For now,
though, this may be the best they can hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are two outstanding worries. One is that his military
enthusiasms will propel him to further recklessness and excess, as
they have already done in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that he is, in fact, something of a mediocrity. KGB
talent-spotters seem not to have thought him worth bringing back
from Germany to a top job in Moscow. His stint in St. Petersburg
ended amid much disappointment with the city's government.
</P>
<P>
   As a Kremlin bureaucrat, he made no great mark. As prime
minister, he tolerated corrupt and incompetent ministers. Apart
from letting the generals loose in Chechnya, which although popular
so far in Russia has not brought the speedy victory he promised,
Putin seems to have achieved remarkably little.
</P>
<P>
   If the war-fever that has stoked his popularity turns to
war-weariness, and Russians begin to take against him, what might
he resort to then? &QL;

for around 12 percent of the population; within the next five
years, they will overtake blacks to become the largest minority

hard, prickly exterior, but its center is surprisingly soft. The
rules that govern immigrants' entry into America and their legal

officially dates back to 1965, when Congress dropped the hated
national quotas it had imposed in the 1920s. Instead, it brought in
quotas that favored family ties. In some ways the act was a

of people who have shown their willingness to compete and their
belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the

   In the 1950 census, America was 89 percent white and 10 percent
black. Other races hardly got a passing glance. Now Latinos account
for around 12 percent of the population; within the next five
years, they will overtake blacks to become the largest minority
group. This survey will seek to answer three fundamental questions:

   America's immigration law is rather like a hedgehog: it has a
hard, prickly exterior, but its center is surprisingly soft. The
rules that govern immigrants' entry into America and their legal
status thereafter are, in turn, contradictory, disingenuous,
hypocritical, downright cruel and ridiculously overly generous.
Were they to be efficiently enforced, the result would be total
chaos...By John Micklethwait, The Economist &QL;

   Like so many other revolutions, America's ethnic make-over
officially dates back to 1965, when Congress dropped the hated
national quotas it had imposed in the 1920s. Instead, it brought in
quotas that favored family ties. In some ways the act was a
surrender to the status quo. Today, most immigrants fall into one
of five categories...By John Micklethwait, The Economist &QL;

 &HT;    Sad end to photo mystery: Air Force officer died in cycle crash
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some stories have happy endings. This one doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force Capt. George Ray Herren, whose Vietnam-era
photographs were published Monday in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at the Atlanta History Center, who had just mounted a
display of the pictures, knew only that they were taken by an Air
Force captain named Herren. They had hoped the display would help
them find him.
</P>
<P>
   But Herren's widow and two grown daughters, all of whom live in
Atlanta, saw the newspaper story and contacted the History Center.
Herren survived his 1968-69 tour of duty in Vietnam but was killed
in a motorcycle accident in the Philippines in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Gue, a graduate student at Emory University, found the
cache of 300 or so negatives a month ago at a flea market in
southwest Atlanta and gave them to the History Center. The center
mounted the display because the photos show a side of life in
Vietnam that most people don't see: tourist-type pictures that
don't make magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   Herren's widow, Mayme Herren, 57, said the negatives were stolen
from her home in 1995, along with her wedding ring and other
belongings. She has never remarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost fainted,'' she said, when she saw Monday's newspaper.
``I knew immediately: `It's my husband.' It was a shock to see the
pictures in the paper. It was the last thing I was expecting to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Herren, a counselor at Fulton County's Price Middle School, said
her husband was killed while the couple was living in the
Philippines with their son and two daughters. Mrs. Herren and the
children returned to her hometown of Mobile, then moved to Atlanta
in 1973 so she could pursue graduate studies at the Atlanta
University Center. Her daughters, Theresa Herren, 28, and Lisa
Herren Blount, 29, also live in the Atlanta area. Theresa is a
district manager for Blockbuster, and Lisa works in human resources
for Sears. Son George Raymond Herren, 32, is an aeronautical
engineer in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Herren, a native of Nacogdoches, Texas, was a mechanical
engineer. After his tour of duty in Vietnam, the family moved to a
base in California, then to another in Minot, N.D., before he was
sent to the Philippines to fly support missions to and from
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been 30 the year he was killed,'' Mayme Herren
said Monday. ``He's buried in the veterans' cemetery in San
Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Blount said she has no memories of her father, but she
remembers seeing some of the same photos in family albums.
</P>
<P>
   Family members plan to meet with History Center officials to
discuss the use of the pictures. For its exhibit, the center wants
to include more information about the man who took them, or whose
friends took pictures of him with his camera.
</P>
<P>
   Blount and Herren said they will try to ascertain where Gue got
the negatives, in hopes that the wedding ring might be found too.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Patriotism and pineapples in WWII
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in America. Back then, or at least the
way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Hynes
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   A couple of 5-pound sacks of sugar were among the most precious
household items that my husband and I brought to our furnished
apartment in Chicago when we were married in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sugar? Well, the United States was at war and the
government had imposed a rationing system to ensure supplies for
the armed forces, and also to prevent hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the imposition of food rationing, I realize that it
was a unique event in the history of our country.
</P>
<P>
   We had all been accustomed to freedom of choice in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries suffering under the control of dictators might
have restrictions placed on their purchasing power, school
attendance, travel or religion, but never in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   We should have been indignant but we were not.
</P>
<P>
   The infamous bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, had united
our people in such a passion of patriotism that we were almost glad
to have this way of showing our cooperation in the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone in the same boat, living under that rationing
system became sort of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the market entailed a great deal of figuring because
suddenly there were two prices on most items: the money price and
the point price.
</P>
<P>
   If a can of fruit cost 16 points, it was too expensive. Instead,
you made the best of it with whatever fresh fruit was available.
</P>
<P>
   Butter was also scarce and expensive in ration points.
</P>
<P>
   Margarine had been available before the war but had not been
popular because it was white and looked like lard.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy industry had fought against this cheaper spread and
won to the extent that it could not be colored yellow by the
manufacturer to look like butter.
</P>
<P>
   However, in each package of margarine was a small capsule of
yellow food coloring that could be mixed in by the customer, and
the ration-free margarine quickly became acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chore that most of us hated, but we did it anyway:
dumping the margarine into a bowl, softening it up with a spoon,
then slowly working in the yellow coloring.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the food items rationed, meat proved the most
difficult for me, since I had grown up eating the best steaks and
roasts from my father's meat market.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, organ meats did not require points. A favorite meal was
boiled beef tongue with mustard sauce, boiled potatoes and spinach.
For leftovers we had cold tongue for sandwiches and beef broth as a
base for vegetable soup.
</P>
<P>
   Each week I would lay out my supply of meat stamps and then make
a shopping list of what I could afford.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, if we were having company, we would splurge and
have a roast, but not often.
</P>
<P>
   One poignant memory comes back to me.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1945 I gave birth to my first son and was kept in the
hospital for several days, suffering from a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   Great efforts were made to bring down the temperature. I was
given a series of shots and had to drink great quantities of water.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, late one night, a nurse announced that the fever had
broken and I could have something to eat.
</P>
<P>
   With that she produced a dish of canned pineapple, something I
had not been able to buy for probably three years.
</P>
<P>
   It was delicious!

   WHITE COUNTY, Ga. _ It's late afternoon, that time of day in the
mountains where the sun seems to hang up for a moment just before
taking a nose-dive behind the nearest hill. The time when I like to
move out onto the deck of my rented cabin-on-stilts, and watch the
woods come alive - deer, raccoons, a possum or two, even an
occasional bear.
</P>
<P>
   But the night life will have to wait a bit. First, I need to pay
a visit to the country store down the road - the one that boils its
own peanuts and has three rocking chairs and a pay phone on the
front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peanuts,'' the lady behind the counter tells me. ``Too
early in the season.'' I pick up some homemade peanut brittle
instead and head for the porch as the screen door slaps familiarly
behind me.
</P>
<P>
   For a minute I stand there in front of the phone, fishing in my
jeans pockets for the long distance calling card I'd slipped in
there earlier. I'm overdue to call my son and let him know I'm well
and happy, down here in the north Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, I was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven numbers I punched in, carefully following instructions on
the flip side of my card. Okay, fiber-optics, do your thing. Ring
me through to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, that doesn't happen. Instead, a recording tells me
I've done it all wrong and I should hang up and try again. I
express my feelings about this to a dead wire and start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beep. Beep. Beep. We are sorry. We cannot complete your call
as dialed. Please hang up and try again.''
</P>
<P>
   All-ll right. I'm doing it again. Punch. Pause. Another beep
followed by a whole different set of instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Very deliberately, and with as little visible loss of patience
as I can muster, I prop my calling card on the windowsill and start
over.
</P>
<P>
   DIAL 0 + Area Code + Phone No. LISTEN for tone and AT&AMP;T. ENTER
Card Number. I do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beep. Beep. Beep.'' Now a different voice is reminding me I
must enter my card number AND my PIN number.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a pin number?'' I catch myself shouting into the
receiver even though I know better than this. There are no humans
left to listen at the phone company. Then I remember how I used to
razz my mother for saying ``Thank you,'' to the time-of-day
recording. She'd remind me that good manners dictate polite
responses - even to a machine.
</P>
<P>
   So I thank the dead mouthpiece, hang up, and repeat the process.
This time, before I can punch in the ``Auth. Code'' which I have
decided may or may not be my PIN number, a voice says it's sorry,
but I've screwed up again and maybe I need to talk to an operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I KNOW I NEED TO TALK TO AN OPERATOR!'' I yell, ashamed of
myself for being reduced to screaming at dead chrome things on
walls. ``I'd give my last bite of peanut brittle for an operator.
Just tell me how do I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there is no answer so I read the card again.
</P>
<P>
   ``DIAL 10 + ATT + 0 + Area Code + Phone No. then ENTER Card
Number after the tone and AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't work either. Now I'm shouting. ``I have just pushed
30 buttons in a row and you're telling me that's not good enough? I
demand to talk to a people!'' I'm beginning to draw a crowd. The
rockers are filled and it's SRO for the crazy lady on the phone
show.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to give it one more try and that's when this odd thing
happens. Somewhere around button 14, something sounding remarkably
like a human voice comes on the line and asks how he might help me.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned silence. He asks again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a recording?'' I ask back. Silence. Finally, I demand
to know: ``Are you, or are you not, a real person?''
</P>
<P>
   His polite response? ``No ma'am. I'm the AT&AMP;T operator.''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't progress just grand?
</P>

 &HT;    Timely tips for tax season
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three out of four American taxpayers expect to get
refunds from the Internal Revenue Service this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans think of that money as a forced savings plan, or
even as a sort of annual bonus from Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Another way of looking at it is this: Your refund was an
interest-free loan to the government. The IRS kept your money for
as much as a year, then gave it back without saying ``thank you''
or rewarding you _ as a bank would _ with an interest payment.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup Poll showed that 46 percent of the 1,000
respondents believe that overpaying their taxes was a good thing
because it prevented them from spending the money as they went
along.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of them spent some or all of their refunds, mostly
for fun or travel. Somewhat larger percentages said they put refund
money into paying bills or savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   They moved the money along quickly, too. About a third spent or
saved their refunds within a week, and 69 percent had disposed of
the money within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The refunds build up when employees have too much money withheld
for taxes from each paycheck. They get the money back the following
year, in refunds.
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessarily a bad thing. ``If you don't have any
other way of saving, it's a good idea,'' said John W. Masters, a
certified public accountant in Atlanta. ``The idea is that if you
have it taken out of your pay, you can't decide to spend it.
Frankly, that was my salvation as a younger person.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you have self-discipline, you're better off keeping and
saving the money by yourself. It's easy enough to arrange: Go to
the payroll department where you work and change the amount you
have withheld from your paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can call (800) 829-1040, ask the IRS to send you
Publication 919 or Publication 505, and figure it out yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do just about anything you want, and it's OK as long
as it's enough to pay your taxes,'' Masters said. ``The real risk
is that you'll end up owing more than you withheld. It's a shock
having to come up with an extra $500 or $1,000 or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with self-discipline, Masters suggests setting up a
direct deposit to a credit union or other financial institution.
The money comes out of your paycheck and marches into your savings
account automatically.
</P>
<P>
   You never get your hands on it, which is the same advantage you
get with too-generous withholding. You also get some interest
payments, which Uncle Sam does not provide.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a refund this year, here are some rewarding ways to
use the money:
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest it in a tax-deferred retirement account. The average
refund last year was $1,542. If you dropped that amount into an
individual retirement account and achieved an average annual return
of 10 percent, you would have $10,374 in 20 years or $26,907 in 30
years. It's a nice start on a retirement savings program.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth individual retirement account is probably the most
beneficial for younger investors.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to pay taxes now on the money you contribute, and
higher-income people could bump their heads on the income ceiling.
But you will owe no taxes at all when you start taking the money
out, assuming you meet certain minimal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Save it for earlier goals. You might get a head start on
buying a house or paying for college for your children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay debts. That feels good, too, especially if you're knocking
off high-interest credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start an emergency fund. That will feel really good if you
lose your job or run into some other disaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give some to charity. It's a case of feeling good by doing
good. You might also get a deduction on next year's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's a question of what makes you happiest. You can
reward yourself with a splurge right now, or you can do the
responsible thing and reward yourself later.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, you could split the money between current and future
goodies. That's what many of the Gallup Poll respondents did and it
is what I would do.

 &HT;    Belly dancing moves women to accept their bodies
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By JoLee Hammer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Belly dancing is not your mother's two-step.
It's not even her Lambada.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's better because it's all about being a woman _ in
a way that Shania Twain can't touch. But she probably could learn a
few things on Friday nights when Melodee Huey teaches three classes
of women more than just how to slide their hips and crunch their
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches them how to love themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started dancing, my stomach had not seen daylight since
1976,'' said Huey, a Mineola resident. ``Like most women I was
never, ever, ever comfortable with my body. I never was pleased
with it. I was always too short, too chubby, too, too, too
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began to belly dance, I started accepting my body and
understanding that I'm supposed to be round. I'm a woman,'' Huey
continued. ``It's nothing to be ashamed of. Even those that are
rounder than some have nothing to be ashamed of. Even those whose
hips are wider have nothing to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey has been belly dancing for about six years. She began
teaching classes this winter at the Panther Park Community Center
in Longview through the city's parks and recreation department. The
course attracted more students than anticipated, and what was
originally supposed to be one class became three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't turn away a woman who wants to belly dance,'' Huey
said one night during class, as she begged for a break, explaining
that she already had taught two other classes that night.
</P>
<P>
   But Huey wasn't complaining. Her smile is almost a constant
fixture on her face as she dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really like to spend the rest of my healthy life
teaching, and as long as there are women who want to learn, and it
won't cost me money to teach, then I will continue to teach,'' Huey
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to see the challenge Huey faced as she stood before
the group of women who gathered the first night of class. The women
were excited. But some were stiff that first night, timidly copying
Huey as she demonstrated the ``isolation techniques'' that are the
root of belly dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation techniques concentrate on moving specific parts of the
body while the rest of the body remains still. Rib cage slides move
the upper body from side to side at the waist, while the hips and
shoulders remain immobile. Figure eight hips make an ``8'' on the
floor or the wall, depending on how the hips are moved, while the
upper body doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Huey urges her students to be patient with themselves as they
learn the isolation techniques. She seems to read some of her
students' minds through the fear in their eyes that says ``my
mother told me not to move like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way Huey explains it, maybe our mothers should have. As
she explained at the beginning of class, belly dancing began as a
physical and spiritual preparation for childbirth thousands of
years ago. Several women would surround another who was in labor,
rolling their stomachs and breathing in a way that resembles
present-day Lamaze to help facilitate the birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do what comes naturally with a smile,'' Huey said.
</P>
<P>
   Huey, who previously was a classical style dancer, knows some
are skeptical about belly dancing. She was one of those people. Her
husband's mother was a belly dancer, and he encouraged his wife to
learn also.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Excuse me. I'm a dancer,' '' she said. ``I was
real snobby about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it changed her life when she started. First, it made her a
lot busier, but Huey said it also increased her self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a sense of self that I had never quite been able to
get a handle on,'' Huey said. ``I haven't been real successful at a
lot of endeavors. I made good grades in school, but I didn't finish
(college). ... It's given me something that is really going to be a
part of my life for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like a rebirth,'' she added. ``I started
studying ancient history, other cultures, other religions, other
literature. ... I started sewing again, which I thought I would
never do. It was kind of like a Renaissance for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks of class progressed, it was easy to see that Huey's
lack of self-consciousness had rubbed off on her students. Some
made traditional belly dance costumes to wear to class. The
stiffness from the first class melted with each passing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Huey showed infinite patience at each class, never laughing or
ridiculing students if their bodies weren't quite moving in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to know that everybody dances at their own
level,'' she said. ``My goal as an instructor is not to produce
performers every time. My goal as an instructor is to produce women
who will belly dance. Everyone's on their own level, and you just
have to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey still takes lessons herself, and is part of a performing
group called ``The Dream Harem'' that performs at Renaissance fairs
and other functions. They occasionally perform at Bernard's
Mediterranean Restaurant in Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best teacher is the perpetual student,'' she said. ``I
truly believe in all my heart that if you had three lifetimes to
spend studying (belly dance) you would never learn it all. It's a
living changing entity all its own. It's so ancient that there's
just so much to know about it.''

 &HT;    Protection from poison
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Child resistant doesn't mean childproof.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than a million children nationwide younger than
age 5 were exposed to potentially poisonous substances.
</P>
<P>
   The 39th annual observance of National Poison Prevention Week is
March 19-25. As always, the focus is prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education and awareness are the keys to prevention,'' said
Brenda Street, poison prevention coordinator for the Carolinas
Poison Center in Charlotte. ``If parents and child-care providers
know the dangers, they can prevent most injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The home is supposed to be a safe haven. All too often it isn't.
The home poses many threats, especially for young children.
Household cleaners, cosmetics, medicines, pesticides and even some
plants are hazards found in almost all homes.
</P>
<P>
   The saying ``out of sight, out of mind'' is perfect when
referring to poison safety and children, said Karen Ramsey, Nash
County Health Department's health education supervisor. To
understand it best, she urges all parents to act like a child for
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get down on the ground and start crawling,'' Ramsey said.
``Put yourself in your child's position. On your hands and knees,
make your way around your house like a child would and look for
potentially harmful substances, like plants or cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   Children learn by exploring the world around them. They're
constantly touching and tasting everything they see. As a child's
mobility increases, so does their ability to reach for a dangerous
product.
</P>
<P>
   Children younger than 5 can't read. They rely on their senses to
help feed their curiosity. If something smells good, looks colorful
and resembles a piece of candy, they'll ingest it.
</P>
<P>
   So don't keep products unattended while using them, Street said.
And use child-resistant products whenever possible, but don't place
too much faith in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a label reads child resistant, it gives parents a false
sense of security,'' Street said. ``Everyday children break into
child-resistant containers. Parents still have to be cautious. It's
best to keep any potentially hazardous substances under lock and
key.''
</P>
<P>
   If a child ingests a potentially hazardous substance, Street
urges parents to call the poison center at (800) 848-6946 or (800)
84TOXIN. Certified specialists in poison prevention are on-hand 24
hours a day, seven days a week, ready to address any and all
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes a certified poison prevention specialist will advise
a parent to feed their child activated charcoal, a substance which
can be bought at most pharmacies. Activated charcoal is specially
processed charcoal that is packaged in a fine power form. When
mixed with a liquid and ingested, the formula absorbs any foreign
chemicals in the body and passes them through one's system the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts warn parents against taking matters into their own
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents get scared and they want to do something, but all too
often they make the situation worse,'' said Cindy Hayes, supervisor
in children's health at Edgecombe County Health Department. ``Some
give their children milk. Others induce vomiting. But really no
action should be taken until you call for help first.

 &HT;    Forsythia wasn't a sign to treat for crabgrass
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One rule of thumb for crabgrass control is that
you should apply a pre-emergent crabgrass-control agent by the time
forsythia bushes start to bloom. That rule is out the window this
year, said Mark Webber of Mark Webber Landscaping Co.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the forsythia bushes in the area were full of their
bright-yellow flowers last week, but they bloomed at least a month
earlier than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Crabgrass seeds probably were germinating in the soil at the
same time the forsythias were blooming. But like many of the
premature blooms from last week, any crabgrass that sprouted
probably was killed by last weekend's cold snap.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT A WHILE BEFORE ATTACKING CRABGRASS
</P>
<P>
   Webber said the best time to apply a crabgrass agent is still
late March and early April, the same time crabgrass preventers are
applied in normal years.
</P>
<P>
   The bluegrass and fescue breeds most people prefer in their
lawns are perennial plants. They go dormant in cold weather, but
they revive and spread as the soil warms.
</P>
<P>
   Crabgrass is an annual plant. Crabgrass plants die in the late
fall and drop seeds that wait until spring to sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Crabgrass-control chemicals work by attacking the seeds as they
germinate so that the crabgrass doesn't get a chance to mature.
However, the chemicals don't stay in the soil very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to have the crabgrass agent on the ground while
the bulk of the germination is going on,'' Webber said. ``That
happens when the soil temperature goes up and stays up.''
</P>
<P>
   Before worrying about applying a crabgrass-control agent, you
should first be sure you have a crabgrass problem.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy lawn is covered with an even, dense growth of grass
plants where mostly grass blades rather than stems are visible.
</P>
<P>
   Crabgrass plants show lots of stem, and the stems and grass
blades tend to sprawl on the ground rather than growing upright.
</P>
<P>
   Crabgrass blades come to a point and are about a quarter-inch
wide. Large crabgrass, the most common variety, has fine hairs on
the tops of the grass blades. A mature crabgrass plant produces a
crest of fingerlike seed pods.
</P>
<P>
   In the height of summer, crabgrass may blend in with the rest of
the lawn. Except for its coarse, stemmy look, you might not notice
it.
</P>
<P>
   But with the first frost of fall, the crabgrass dies. That can
leave brown, bare spots in the places where crabgrass has displaced
perennial grass.
</P>
<P>
   If you have remnants of plants around your yard that fit the
crabgrass description, or if you have bare spots where grass was
growing last summer, applying a crabgrass-control chemical along
with your early spring fertilizer is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   HOW ARE YOUR EVERGREENS DOING?
</P>
<P>
   The odd warm spell we had in late February and early March isn't
the only unusual climatic condition our plants are dealing with,
Webber said. We're also in the midst of several years of
below-average rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly hard on evergreen trees, Webber said.
``People are seeing needles dropping and limbs dying back, and the
problem is that 90 percent of the population doesn't call until the
plant is two-thirds dead, and that's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Cramer, horticulturist for Siebenthaler Nurseries, said
people don't usually realize their evergreens are in trouble until
they're in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at Christmas trees,'' she said. ``They're cut down
in the fall, and they still can look healthy when you throw them
away in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said one sign of health that should be monitored is
budding _ the tips of limbs should have live buds.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for branches that are obviously dead and browning.
Look for excessive insect infestation and signs of fungus attacking
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Webber and Cramer said most evergreens don't like either too
much water or too little. The stress of too little rainfall has
been building up in local trees for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Webber said tree owners should look for signs that their
evergreens are not flourishing and call in a professional if they
suspect trouble. ``If we catch the problems early enough, there are
often ways a tree can be saved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said it's important to keep trees watered during drought
periods. Trees need about an inch of rainfall a week, and, when not
much rain is falling, the tree owner needs to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn sprinklers that spray water in the air over a large area of
grass aren't best for trees. Trees need water on their roots, not
branches.
</P>
<P>
   A soaker hose or sprinkler hose placed on the ground under the
branches does the best job. Remember that the roots of the tree
usually spread out underground from the trunk of the tree to about
as far as the branches extend outward.
</P>
<P>
   A gradual, thorough soaking that moistens the first inch of soil
once a week is better than several lighter sprinklings several
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   If your evergreen has dead branches, but you don't want to call
in a professional arborist, Cramer said you shouldn't start cutting
the dead branches away immediately. Most evergreens aren't like
leaf-shedding trees, which usually tolerate late winter pruning
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until late summer to remove dead branches, and think
before you cut,'' Cramer said. ``Branches on tree evergreens don't
grow back.''

 &HT;    Honda S2000 roadster a fun, hot item
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Honda's high-profile S2000, an all-new and virtually
hand-built head-turner, comes with all the classic characteristics
of a real sports car. It's as quick as credit card debt, hangs on
like a bad reputation, is as noisy as a jackhammer and rides like a
pogo stick.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's delightful. And that's why would-be buyers and
sellers are prompting inflated prices, with some classified ads
appearing in cities offering nearly new cars for as much as
$38,500.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that this is a car base-priced at $32,000; the
tester with add-on floor mats totaled $32,477. Honda hopes the
market will perceive it as offering more performance than cheaper
performance convertibles (the Mazda Miata and Ford Mustang, for
example) and being a bargain compared with its performance peers
(Chevrolet's Corvette and Porsche's Boxster, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews give Honda execs grins akin to those of first-time
drivers. Automobile magazine calls the S2000 a ``tech-head's
dream,'' Consumer Guide says it's a ``bargain'' packed with
performance and Honda quality, and Road &AMP; Track finds it
``stylish'' and ``exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivetrain is superb. Honda found 240 horsepower in its
2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine _ quite an accomplishment for a
street-legal car _ and hooked it to a six-speed transmission that
requires only a flick of the wrist to shift. The problem is
avoiding premature shifts because the engine redlines at 9,000 rpm,
with peak power and torque at 7,500-8,500 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting virtually everything right, Honda did manage to
include one bit of foppery: To crank the S2000, turn on the
column-mounted ignition switch to the right of the steering wheel,
then push the large red button reading ``engine start'' on the dash
to the left of the wheel. It reminds one of 1940s and '50s
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is a comfy cocoon for two. Seats are body-fitting
hip to head, and controls can be finger-operated without really
taking a hand off the wheel. But the power cloth top (up or down in
about six seconds) and plastic rear window cut visibility. Drivers
who rest their arm on the wide center tunnel while cruising or
shifting gears may find the drink holder and storage hole
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But the aggravations are minor in view of what the S2000
delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Purists may even forgive the digital speedometer and tachometer
arched across the speedo because of the ease and speed with which
they run up the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Honda S2000 roadster
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $32,477 (base: $32,000, plus $415 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (240
horsepower), six-speed manual transmission
</P>

 &HT;    Getting back to nature with organic gardening
 &HT;    By Christine Moran
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ A growing trend among gardeners today is
organic gardening. Maybe you've thought about starting an organic
garden, but it seemed too overwhelming. It really isn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you can grow a conventional garden, you can grow an organic
one, said Dr. Mary Peet, a professor in the department of
horticultural sciences at N.C. State University.
</P>
<P>
   Organic gardeners don't use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides
on plants. When you garden organically, you think of your plants as
part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and
includes the water supply, wildlife and even insects.
</P>
<P>
   Just like you would do if you were starting a conventional
garden, look around your yard for an area that receives 6 to 8
hours of direct sunlight daily. Prepare the site by loosening the
soil with a shovel. Add several inches of compost to it.
Vegetables, fruits, herbs and flowers thrive best in raised beds,
which are built 4 to 6 inches above the ground, Peet said. Soil in
raised beds drains quickly so plants never sit in water.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting plants, choose ones that aren't prone to
diseases. Ask your neighborhood nursery and garden center for help
in selecting plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most organic gardeners go through a trial-and-error period,''
said Jeffery Hedgepeth, manager at The Green Thumb Nursery in Rocky
Mount. ``Gardeners usually have to experiment to find the best
crops or plants that work best with their soil conditions. We can
only help point you in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional gardeners control weeds with herbicides, but not
organic gardeners. They arm themselves with mulch. Decaying plant
wastes, such as grass clippings, leaves and vegetable scraps from
the kitchen are great building blocks for compost, the ideal
organic matter for your garden soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reuse and recycle,'' Peet said. ``Don't put waste in the trash
when you can put it back in the ground. Live with nature, not
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   A layer of mulch blocks light from weeds and stops or slows
their growth. If weeds make their way to the surface, Peet says,
buy a good hoe and get to work. Conventional gardeners apply
pesticides to the garden to ward off threatening insects. Organic
gardeners don't use synthetic chemicals, but they can take other
steps to protect their garden from pests.
</P>
<P>
   Insects usually attack stressed or sick plants. The best
defenses against insect attack are preventative measures, Peet
said. Grow plants suited to the site and they'll be less stressed.
Don't let plants get too wet, too dry or too shaded.
</P>
<P>
   Many plant diseases are encouraged by constant moisture and too
little air circulating around plants, Peet said. To remedy that,
plan your garden with enough room to accommodate full-grown plants,
because water evaporates more slowly and air doesn't circulate well
among crowded plants.
</P>
<P>
   Organic gardeners work constantly to build nutrient-rich soil.
Peet describes the ideal soil as dark-colored, sweet smelling and
full of earthworms. Gardeners can achieve ideal soil by continually
adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to their soil.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in organically grown food is evident at grocery stores
everywhere. Consumers are reading labels and buying products that
were raised without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.

 &HT;    Oscar nominees' talent shines through in previous performances
 &HT;    By Steve Uhler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gearing up for the annual ritual of the Oscars
is kind of like embarking on a new love affair: A lot of foreplay
and speculation, the Big Event itself, and, depending on the
outcome, either a satisfied smile or a morning-after headache.
</P>
<P>
   While you can't watch this year's nominated performances on
video or DVD yet, it's a perfect time to look back at some of the
nominees' earlier performances that helped get them to where they
are today. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Best Actor nominee (``American Beauty'') Kevin Spacey is
arguably the most admired actor in movies, creating a gallery of
unforgettable characters, and he just keeps getting better. Savor
his breakthrough role as clubfooted chatterbox Verbal Kint in
1995's clever ``The Usual Suspects.'' It was a dream part, and the
versatile Spacey made the most of it in a tour-de-force
performance, winning him the Oscar that year for Best Supporting
Actor (where he memorably thanked Keyser Soze as he accepted the
award.)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember a year in which Meryl Streep hasn't
received a Best Actress nomination (this year's is for ``Music of
the Heart''); her nominations are as ubiquitous as her dialects.
She's been nominated 12 times and won twice, as Best Supporting
Actress for her role as the conflicted mother who deserts her child
in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (1979), and Best Actress for her wrenching
performance as a Polish prisoner-of-war at Auschwitz who must
decide which of her two children will live in ``Sophie's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Best Actress nominee, Annette Bening has not had that
many high-impact, showcase roles. Her best performance is in Steven
Frears' gritty ``The Grifters'' (1990), where, as manipulative and
ambitious femme fatale Myra, she schemes to get boyfriend and
small-time con artist Roy (John Cusack) into the big leagues. It's
a great, eye-opening turn _ but inevitably upstaged by Angelica
Huston as Lily, Roy's seen-it-all, ``reformed'' mom. When Myra
introduces herself as ``Roy's friend,'' the savvy Lily looks her
down and smiles, ``Yes, I imagine you're lots of people's friend.''
And the claws are out.
</P>
<P>
   Best Actor nominee for ``The Straight Story,'' 79-year-old
Richard Farnsworth may not have the most high-profile acting career
but, after 53 years in the profession, he's had one of the most
enduring. He made his film debut in the Marx Brothers' 1937 classic
``A Day At The Races'' and has been going ever since. Farnsworth
finally achieved stardom in 1982 when he starred as ``The Grey
Fox,'' an over-the-hill gentleman bandit in 1901 who, after serving
33 years in San Quentin prison, is released into the 20th century _
where there are no stagecoaches to rob. It's an elegiac, wistful
performance in a wonderful film.
</P>
<P>
   The academy passed on Tom Cruise this year for Stanley Kubrick's
lethargic ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' but he did get a nod for his
supporting turn in ``Magnolia'' as sex guru Frank T.J. Mackey.
Cruise first gained attention as the entrepreneurial teen in 1990's
``Risky Business,'' but didn't get respect until his powerful
performance as hustler Charlie Babbitt, Dustin Hoffman's
self-centered brother, in ``Rain Man'' (1988). He was even better
as real-life veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's ``Born On The
Fourth of July'' (1989), convincingly evolving from patriotic teen
to embittered paraplegic activist.

 &HT;    For gun lobby, ounce of prevention is worth pound of blather
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The talking head of the Gun Owners Association
appeared cool, composed and not in need of medication.
</P>
<P>
   So why was he talking about pill bottles?
</P>
<P>
   Well, because they're suddenly relevant to gun control, that's
why. Here. The association has a position paper on it.
</P>
<P>
   Through its chromium-throated spokesman, the association was
voicing outrage over Smith &AMP; Wesson's agreement to sell external,
unremovable trigger locks with its handguns, among other
concessions to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Safety measures like this won't make people safer, the gun lobby
says. As an example, it points to a Harvard University study
asserting that child-resistant medicine-bottle caps have resulted
in 3,500 additional poisonings of small children annually. Really?
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, parents let down their guard because of
child-safety caps, making the world less safe.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating. Comparing apples to deer droppings, but
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Apples: Show of hands, now. Who wishes, in the name of safety,
to ban the use of child-resistant medicine caps? (You can ask your
pharmacist that your pill bottles not have them. That's another
matter.) I didn't think many of you would ban child-proof caps. You
know they're worth having.
</P>
<P>
   Deer droppings: The gun lobby will peddle anything to stall
reasoned efforts to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   At its root, the gun lobby's base argument against trigger locks
is that they are an impediment to split-second use. That might be
valid if every gun were locked every moment. But the definition of
a gun lock is that it can be unlocked. So one who doesn't want to
lock his or her gun wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   In gun locks, as with any other form of merchandise, you get
what you pay for. You can either get one that can be easily
compromised by a child, or one that baffles the owner.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Smith &AMP; Wesson is confident that the combination
trigger locks it plans will meet the test.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is a spurious argument that trigger locks are a
danger in and of themselves, just like that rhetorical flier on
medicine bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Just as one could leave his Smith &AMP; Wesson gun unlocked even
with its built-in gizmo, one could leave his pill bottles open so
as not to hassle with a child-proof cap. That person had better not
have children around in either case.
</P>
<P>
   Only because we have come to think of a handgun as something as
common as a cantaloupe do we have arguments about things like this.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine auto manufacturers disputing the need for keys to the
car. No argument. You are within your rights to leave the keys in
the ignition in the driveway, just as you would be with your
handgun unlocked on your nightstand even with a mandatory trigger
lock as the U.S. Senate would require.
</P>
<P>
   A lock's simple function is to give the owner control over who
uses something of value. If a gun owner chooses not to use a
trigger lock, he proceeds at his considerable risk if he has
children in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby proceeds to do what it can to stall and ensnare
reasoned efforts to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   It is fascinating these days to hear, as the National Rifle
Association's new No. 1 position, that the federal government isn't
doing enough to enforce the laws on the books. You'd almost think
it supported those laws, like Brady background checks for gun
sales. The fact is that the NRA fought Brady with all of its might.
And the only reason we needed Brady was to enforce laws that were
already on the books banning gun sales to felons, minors, illegal
aliens and others.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to keep up with the gun lobby. But don't stop trying.

 &HT;    World-class bass lake's fish could all be dead in 2 years
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lake Okeechobee has long been known as
one of the top bass lakes in the world, but some say soon that may
be nothing but a memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conditions of the lake remain the same, in two years,
there will be no fish in the lake,'' said Steve Gornak, biologist
with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in
Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate crisis, he said, is caused by the abnormally high
water level of the lake _ 15.3 feet. ``There are supposed to be
periods of naturally high and naturally low levels of water. But
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is using the lake as a reservoir.
Their schedule for releasing the water is causing high water levels
even when they do release.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh and lake-bottom vegetation crucial to the fish and
wildlife is being destroyed by wave action caused by the deeper
water, Gornak said. Young fish, nesting birds and wildlife are
beginning to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The corps is responsible for maintaining the lake level. At a
recent meeting with lake residents, biologists and environmental
groups, the engineers agreed the lake was now being used as a
reservoir and said they would be lowering the level, but they
hedged on saying how much and when.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gray, manager of the Audubon Society's Lake Okeechobee
sanctuaries, acknowledges the lake must be used for water storage
but, he said, ``it has to be managed with the lake's health in
mind. And while the current level is the single most important
threat to the health of the lake, it's not the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Phosphorus levels in the lake are high, the result of runoff
from farms and dairies around the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely in trouble,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Head of Okeechobee has organized a Friends of the Lake
organization, a nonprofit group dedicated to saving the lake. For
more information, call (863) 763-3568.

realize it has gone mostly unrecognized until someone finally makes
it out loud. Thus with U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley's
mention that in its immigrant population, the United States has a
potentially huge advantage over most other nations in an
internationalizing world. Riley has put the Clinton administration
_ and one hopes, beyond that, U.S. policy _ strongly behind a form
of bilingual education that mixes English-speaking students with
classmates reared in other tongues, with the objective of making
both sets fluent in both languages. (Teepen, Cox News Service.)

   COXNET WHEELS 0321 _ The ``pocket rocket'' segment of the auto

concerns and fuel costs, but Pontiac blithely soldiers on with its

<P>
   TEEN-CARS _ Baby boomers who remember the days when hot teen-age
cars packed 350-plus horsepower and macho nameplates like Mustang,
Barracuda and GTO will be surprised at what passes for ``hot''
among today's teens. Faced with exorbitant sticker prices and
environmentally correct engines, young car enthusiasts are buying
econo-boxes like Neons, Escorts, Cavaliers and Civics, then jazzing
up the peripherals to turn them into lean, mean street machines _
at least from the outside. (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News). 30. WITH

   POISON-PREVENTION _ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Child resistant doesn't

Prevention Week is March 19-25. As always, the focus is prevention.

   BELLY-DANCERS _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ Belly dancing is not your
mother's two-step. It's not even her Lambada. Actually, it's better
because it's all about being a woman _ in a way that Shania Twain
can't touch. But she probably could learn a few things on Friday
nights when Melodee Huey teaches three classes of women more than
just how to slide their hips and crunch their stomachs. She teaches
them how to love themselves. (Hammer, Longview News-Journal) MOVED.

vulnerable during periods of uncertainty or rejection. Ask any job
hunter. Sometimes there will be hurt feelings no matter what you

December, 1941. On March 22, 1933, a few miles north of Munich, the
German government opened Dachau, the first in a series of

 &HT;    Police search Ala. woods for gun used to kill deputy
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers searched for a murder weapon today in a
wooded area near White Hall, Ala., where Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin was
arrested Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still trying to determine how Al-Amin, who is
charged in the shooting death of a Fulton County sheriff's deputy
and the wounding of a second deputy, got from Atlanta to White
Hall, said William Imfeld, special agent in charge of the FBI's
Mobile office.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin had been staying with a fellow Muslim in a rented house
in White Hall, said Lowndes County Sheriff Willie Vaughner.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was being represented at his arraignment hearing today
in federal court in Montgomery by state Sen. Hank Sanders of Selma
and J.L. Chestnut, according to the U.S. Marshal's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Imfeld said three U.S. marshals were in White Hall looking for a
Toyota 4-Runner registered to Al-Amin at a White Hall address on
Monday when, at about 5:30 p.m. CST, they were fired upon by
.223-caliber rounds. The Fulton County deputies were shot with
rounds from a .223-caliber assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, a 1985 Cadillac came by and picked up the
(unknown) shooter, drove down County Road 40 and pulled into a
house at 531 County Road,'' Imfeld said. Imfeld said he was not
sure why the car pulled in at that house.
</P>
<P>
   The car then circled around the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that very odd. We were looking to see if it was part
of a scheme, if he was with them, or if it gave them an opportunity
to draw attention away from where Al-Amin may have been,'' Imfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI set up a roadblock and arrested six occupants of the
Cadillac, two of them juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Four were being held in federal custody in Montgomery today for
questioning for shooting at the marshals and possibly for harboring
Al-Amin, Imfeld said. The juveniles were released to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   About three hours after the marshals were initially shot at,
marshals were fired upon again, and Al-Amin was seen running into a
wooded area at the corner of White Hall Road and County Road 80,
Imfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughner said no one was injured in the exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 law enforcement personnel, including dog teams, gave
chase and Al-Amin ``basically ran out of the woods into the arms of
a deputy,'' Imfeld said. ``Within seconds there were about two
dozen agents on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of White Hall said today he has known Al-Amin since
the 1960s , when he was known as Black Panther leader H. Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Jackson said he and Al-Amin met in 1965 and were
members of the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, a nonviolent
Christian organization that tried to put black candidates on the
ballot. The organization used the Black Panther emblem as a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a year ago, (Al-Amin) came in to try to start up a
mosque but there were not enough people,'' Jackson said. ``They
opened a restaurant. It is the only one in town that does not sell
alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Al-Amin came to White Hall ``about every two or
three months,'' but added that the last time he saw him was in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said in the past he had Al-Amin talk to the children of
White Hall about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in the struggle for a long time but when someone
crosses the line, we have to deal with it,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents arrived in Lowndes County, Ala., about four days ago,
said Vaughner. They suspected Al-Amin might return to his activist
roots and knew that he had a vehicle registered in the area,
Vaughner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Panther Party's origins are in Lowndes County. The
animal was adopted as a symbol of black voting rights after a mass
meeting in the county more than 30 years ago. The late civil rights
activist Stokely Carmichael left Lowndes County after that meeting
and helped lead the Black Panther Party to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin had been the subject of a nationwide manhunt since
Thursday night. Deputy Richard Kinchen, 35, and Deputy Aldranon
English, 28, were trying to serve a warrant on Al-Amin. Kinchen
died; English is recovering from his injuries at Grady Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's arrest was the result of information investigators
received soon after the deputies were shot, Atlanta Police Chief
Beverly Harvard said at a late night news conference at City Hall
East.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Celeste Armstead agreed: ``It was unbelievable
cooperation between several agencies that worked hard to catch this
man.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, FBI agents took Al-Amin, who was wearing a
white shirt, sweat pants and sunglasses, to the Montgomery Police
Department. He was fingerprinted and booked at the Montgomery City
Jail late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said a handgun was found in the woods after Al-Amin's
arrest. She said it is not known whether the gun was used in the
shooting earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said English had expressed
relief about Al-Amin's arrest. ``He said, 'Tonight I can sleep.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that it happened in this time frame,'' the
sheriff said, referring to today's funeral service for the slain
deputy. ``This will add a different air to the service. On a good
day this would be a difficult service, this will help us through a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said Al-Amin will be arraigned in Alabama on federal
charges of firing on federal agents. A warrant has been issued in
Atlanta charging him with murder and aggravated assault. He has
also been charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she does not know when Al-Amin will be returned to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Several other people were detained in White Hall, she said, ``as
it relates to the possibility of their harboring a person that we
had a warrant on.'' About six people were being questioned but were
not under arrest as of Monday night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   White Hall is a little country town located off State Highway
80. It does not have stop lights or sidewalks.There is a town hall
and church at the intersection of County Roads 23 and 30 and some
houses and general stores nearby in the town, which the mayor said
has a current population of about 1,800.

TEXAS INMATE USED DENTAL FLOSS TO ESCAPE CELL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A suspected member of a deadly prison gang who
is accused of killing a rival gang member last week painstakingly
sawed his way out of his cell with dental floss or similar
plastic-coated string, a high-ranking official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been able to determine is that he was using some
nylon string _ something like dental floss _ and was putting an
abrasive on it like toothpaste and was able to saw through the bar
that way,'' said Alfred M. ``Mac'' Stringfellow, chairman of the
Texas Board of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Antonio Lara, 26, a suspected member of the prison gang
Hermanos de Pistoleros Latinos (HPL), is accused in the stabbing
death last week of Roland Rios, 41, a confirmed member of the Texas
Syndicate gang, at the Coffield Unit. The killing sparked a
systemwide lockdown that prison administrators hoped would prevent
gang warfare from erupting.
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow said Lara, who is serving a 15-year sentence for
attempted murder, robbery and aggravated assault out of Webb
County, crawled out from under his cell bars to get at Rios as he
was being escorted by guards to the shower. Rios was serving a
10-year term for aggravated robbery and injury to a child from
Nueces County.
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow said he did not know how many bars Lara cut through
to get out of his cell.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-11 and 269 pounds, however, he likely would have had
to cut through several bars.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen Castlebury
declined to discuss the details of how Lara got out or whether the
prisoner returned to his cell after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very dedicated at doing this,'' Stringfellow said of
Lara's persistence in cutting the cell bars. ``These are items they
get very readily at the commissary. They are very resourceful
people. That's all they have is time, so they can sit there and saw
away until they finally are able to cut through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow, however, said prison administrators still are not
certain whether the killing was a gang-ordered hit or personal spat
between Lara and Rios.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were concerned about was that the Texas Syndicate
members may want to do some retaliation against the HPL, so that
was the reason'' for the lockdown, Stringfellow added.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Department of Criminal Justice warden Terry Pelz,
who now is a nationally recognized prison-gang expert, said that if
Lara did cut his way out of his cell, ``then this was a
well-planned attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The HPL are determined to make a name for themselves,'' he
said. ``While the war has gone on for a couple of months, the
attack on Rios was an opportunity that presented itself. It may
well have been something personal between the two and it was a
pre-emptive strike. Anyway, it's too late. A lockdown won't be a
cooling-off period. The TS is run from California. Orders to pursue
the HPL all out will come from there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that problems between the TS and HPL have been
escalating over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, another former prison official with prison gang
expertise said that TDCJ gang-intelligence officers had issued an
alert earlier this year that trouble was brewing between these two
particular gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been bubbling for a while,'' said the expert who
asked not to be identified. ``There's a lot of tension right now
... The TS will respond, even if it takes six years. But they will
respond and in greater fashion.''

   Meanwhile on Monday, wardens at units across the state began
gradually allowing some inmates out of their cells, Castlebury
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know how many prisoners remained in lockdown
status nor how many weapons or other contraband was found. Some
portions of most units have been released, Castlebury said, but
there are no units totally freed from lockdown status. He added it
will likely be midweek before any units lift sanctions for all
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the contraband confiscated during the lockdown
as typical of what TDCJ finds whenever it shakes down prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't going to be something like a 9 mm Glock that's
found,'' he added. ``It's just routine and heavily nuisance
contraband _ overage of necessity, like someone has entirely too
many more pairs of undies than he's supposed to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people are just pack rats, and it's time for
housecleaning.''

GOVERNMENT CANNOT REGULATE TOBACCO AS DRUG, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a big victory for the cigarette industry, the
Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Tuesday that the government does not have
the authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
   The justices declared that the Food and Drug Administration had
reached beyond its authority in 1996, when it reversed its own
decades-old policy and moved to crack down on cigarette sales to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that
the FDA has sought to address,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote
for the court, acknowledging that the agency had shown that
``tobacco use, particularly among children and adolescents, poses
perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But, O'Connor concluded, Congress simply did not give the FDA
the authority it sought to exercise over tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations at issue in the case (Food and Drug
Administration vs. Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., No. 98-1152)
prohibit the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to people
under 18 and require retailers to check the identification of those
under the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   But the court ruled Tuesday that it is up to Congress to decide
how much regulation of tobacco, and what kind, the government
should impose. In recent years, federal, state and local lawmakers
have placed more and more restrictions on tobacco use, and there is
no sign that that trend will change. But Tuesday's decision was
nonetheless a big disappointment for the Clinton administration,
which had embraced FDA regulations as its main anti-tobacco
initiative, and for the 40 states that sided with the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry had argued in part that, since the FDA had
concluded that cigarettes were dangerous, it logically ought to
move to ban them altogether _ assuming it was found to have
jurisdiction _ rather than regulate them.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, sided with
the industry in a 2-1 ruling in August 1998. The appeal from that
case led to Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   When the high court heard arguments on Dec. 1, several justices
were openly skeptical of the government's arguments, partly because
for decades after it was created in 1938 the FDA maintained that it
had no authority to regulate smoking, and then switched its
position in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In December, O'Connor said regulating smoking ``just doesn't
fit'' within the agency's authority. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia were similarly skeptical then,
so it was no surprise Tuesday that they joined O'Connor's decision,
as did Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lineup of dissenters was a small reminder that the
tribunal's rulings are not always predictable based on its members'
comments from the bench. In December, Justice David H. Souter also
seemed unconvinced by the government's arguments. But Tuesday, he
sided with the government in dissenting from the majority, along
with Justices John Paul Stevens, Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.

POPE ARRIVES IN ISRAEL ON PILGRIMAGE TO MIDDLE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-HOLYLAND-BAPTISM) 
(js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II arrived in Israel Tuesday on the
first diplomatic visit ever by a pope to the Jewish state,
appealing for peace in a region that has grappled with religious
and political conflicts for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``May peace be God's gift to the land that he chose as his
own,'' the pope said in a brief speech. ``Shalom,'' he said in
conclusion, using the Hebrew word for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech he praised Prime Minister Ehud Barak as ``a man of
peace'' and asked that Jews, Christians and Muslims come together
to settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that my visit will serve the cause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope was welcomed by warm words from political leaders,
prayers and a military fanfare as he arrived at Ben Gurion
International Airport aboard a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane
bearing the flags of Israel and the Vatican. With a large
delegation of dignitaries looking on, he descended the stairs from
the plane and kissed Israeli soil that was in a bowl held up to him
by three young boys _ one Jewish, one Christian and one Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Holy Land,'' said Barak as he shook the pope's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Jerusalem, as his plane carried him over Palestinian
territories, the pope sent a telegram to the Palestinian leader,
Yasir Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my flight from Amman to Tel Aviv takes me over the
Palestinian autonomous areas, I greet your excellency,'' the pope's
message said. ``In eager anticipation of my visit to Bethlehem and
the Palestinian territories I ask Almighty God to bless the
Palestinian people and to strengthen in all the peoples of the
Middle East the resolve to bring about a just and stable peace in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope normally sends telegrams to heads of state when he
flies over their countries, but officials said it is rare for him
to send a message to a leader of a territory that is not a state.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is scheduled to visit Bethlehem in the Palestinian
territories on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For John Paul, the trip to Israel fulfills one of the enduring
dreams of his 21-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, on the 2000 anniversary of the birth of Jesus
Christ, it has been my strong personal desire to come here and to
pray,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The only other pope to visit Israel was Paul VI in 1964. But
that visit came at a time when Israel and the Vatican did not have
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The pope arrived in Jerusalem from Amman, Jordan, where he
celebrated Mass earlier Tuesday for an estimated 40,000 Jordanians
in a local sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Resplendent in red vestments and speaking under a yellow and
white awning, the 79-year-old pope told his congregation, many of
whom came from the small Christian community in Jordan and other
Arab countries, ``Your future lies in unity and solidarity.`
</P>
<P>
   The pope expressed the hope that the Roman Catholic Church would
use its resources to set unity and love as the ``supreme goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Judaism and Islam, he also called for a stronger
bond ``between the Christians and the other great religions which
flourish here'' in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Jordan, the pope went by helicopter to Wadi
al-Kharrar on the east bank of the Jordan River, where some
Christian scholars believe that Jesus was baptized by John the
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Jordan on Monday, the pope began his
pilgrimage in the Holy Land by praying on Mount Nebo in Jordan, the
site where the Bible says Moses first viewed the biblical Promised
Land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Paul, who first mentioned his desire to make a spiritual
journey to the key biblical sites of Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian-controlled territories in his maiden Christmas homily
in 1978, has battled his ill-health and the political turmoil of
the Middle East to make this journey in the year 2000, a Holy Year
for the Roman Catholic Church. He made a pilgrimage to Israel in
1963 when he was a bishop of Krakow, but had never been to Mount
Nebo.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, however personally important to the pope, also has
vast political and social significance to the region, and to
history.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who has often spoken on behalf of the Palestinians'
right to a homeland, will also tour a Palestinian refugee camp.

AC/DC FILLS IN THE GAPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``Stiff Upper Lip; AC/DC; Elektra'' 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The joy of listening to a new AC/DC album is in finding the
Aussie rock band's latest metal fantasy. The song that has the
requisite amount of Brian Johnson's grainy falsetto and enough of
Angus Young's guitar-rendered electrocution to be dubbed a
head-banging classic. The cut that you know will be Young's newest
song to duckwalk to on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, then, the disappointment of not finding such a song on
the band's latest album, ``Stiff Upper Lip.'' Initially it's a
letdown, but a second listen offers comfort in the band's return to
blues-based guitar roots. AC/DC hasn't put together a collection of
songs this raw and unpolished in the 20 years since Bon Scott died
and Johnson took over vocal duties.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years, AC/DC has assembly-line-produced the kind of grand
finale guitar romps that most arena bands hope for just once in a
career. Early on, it was ``Highway to Hell'' and ``Dirty Deeds Done
Dirt Cheap.'' Later, it peaked with ``You Shook Me All Night Long''
and ``Who Made Who'' in the early to mid-'80s. Even more recent
tracks like ``Thunderstruck'' and ``Shoot To Thrill'' have provided
the perfect platform for Young to scamper around naughtily in his
schoolboy short suits.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the Scott and Johnson years is what
filled the album space between manifestos. Almost all of AC/DC's
'90s catalog was chord-crunchers designed to swing a skull off its
neck pivot. In Scott's day, the band balanced the bombast with a
three-chord jam, like in ``The Jack'' or ``Let There Be Rock,''
that built slowly into an explosion. The formula allowed the band's
real T.N.T. to stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiff Upper Lip'' has stripped away several layers of feedback
to allow that to happen again. Opening with the honky-tonk guitar
of the title track, Young's guitar is the primary voice throughout
the 12 songs. Whether it be the John Lee Hooker chord progressions
of ``Meltdown'' or the backyard swing and loose strings of
``Satellite Blues,'' Young provides the musical chorus that sticks
in the head while Johnson does the noodling with his voice.
</P>
<P>
   About the closest ``Stiff Upper Lip'' gets to a roof-raiser is
``Safe in New York City,'' which combines a beat built on cymbals
with Young's deft finger touches on guitar and Johnson's most
prominent falsetto whispers just begging to shriek. It's followed
closely by ``Can't Stand Still,'' featuring Young's trademarked
guitar rolls, the ones that sound like live wires dipped in water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold Me Back'' is unique in that it's nearly a ballad. Instead
of taking the opportunity to yowl on the change from chorus to
verse, the band takes the song title's advice. Nothing here will
probably ever be held up as AC/DC's finest, but they should sound
great in concert between the monster hits.

   On this date in 1874, the great magician Harry Houdini was born.
He was a native of what country?

   One of the great wines of the world is vintage port, but it can
get expensive. But, magically it seems, you can get most of the
pleasure for a fraction of the cost with a vintage-character port,
such as the 1994 Taylor ``Late Bottled Vintage'' Port _ 4 stars _
with lush, cassis-and-chocolate undertones. And it manages to
balance its sweetness with good acidity, a high-wire act not all

FRAGRANT GLADIOLUS SAID TO THRIVE IN SOUTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I planted fragrant gladiolus (Acidanthera) several
years ago, but only two have bloomed. Where should I plant them,
and in what kind of soil?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Acidanthera bicolor'' or ``Gladiolus callianthus'' is
commonly called Abyssinian sword lily or peacock orchid and is
supposedly a good perennial for most regions of the South,
including coastal areas. This member of the iris family likes sun
and a well-draining garden soil. You can leave the corms in a
well-mulched bed during winter. When new growth appears, fertilize.
</P>
<P>
   But some gardeners prefer to dig the corms in fall after the
leaves have yellowed, allow them to dry, store at a cool
temperature in a dry material through winter, then replant in
spring. I have not grown this plant, but there are those who think
this process leads to better blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you please give information on primroses?
Fertilization, light requirements? Is this an indoor or outdoor
plant?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom leaves of my plants are turning yellow, and the green
leaves are starting to curl.
</P>
<P>
   A: Primroses are grown outdoors in beds or containers during the
cooler months. If you plant them in mid-to-late fall, they will
perform through spring. Primroses prefer partial or bright shade.
Best results come with an organically enriched, moist but
well-draining soil. Plants in afternoon sun during the recent
80-plus-degree days may not be as lush and green as those receiving
more shade. Heat and/or irregular watering can cause foliage to
curl. Overwatering and/or a poorly draining soil can also trigger
yellow leaves.
</P>
<P>
   There are three species of primroses used here: ``Primula
malacoides,'' which produces dense clusters of small pink, rose,
lavender or white flowers; ``P. obconica,'' which produces clusters
of larger pink, rose, lavender/blue and white flowers; and the ``P.
polyantha hybrids,'' which are available in pastels and striking
blues, reds and bright yellows with contrasting eyes. ``P.
obconica'' is a short-lived perennial; the other species are
annuals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three years ago I planted four dewberry bushes; one I believe
was `Cheyenne.'' How do I care for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Blackberries tolerate various soil conditions but prefer a
well-draining, slightly acidic sandy loam.
</P>
<P>
   There are upright and trailing varieties of blackberries. Both
should be pruned after harvest.
</P>
<P>
   About the time older canes bear fruit, you should see new canes
developing. As the development occurs, remove all but five to seven
of the newer canes on each plant. On upright varieties, trim the
tips of these newer canes when they reach 4 feet. Trim tips of
trailing types when the new canes have reached the top of the
support. This will encourage them to branch. Keep your row of
berries in check by removing suckers.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a 3-1-2-ratio fertilizer just before flowering and after
harvest. Keep the weeds down and debris removed to help control
disease. Mulch helps.
</P>
<P>
   Blackberry varieties for this area include `Cheyenne,' `Brazos,'
`Choctaw' and `Comanche.'

FINDING REAL DEAL CAN BE A CHALLENGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I was visiting the other day with a friend who applied
an alarming perspective to travel at the start of a new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to think that it's easier just to stay home,''
he said. ``When I get ready to arrange a vacation, I feel as if I'm
being tugged in every direction. There are so many new online
sites, so many confusing airline and hotel promotions, so many
special deals for kids or families or couples or seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's good to have all these options,'' he continued,
``but I get a headache trying to figure it all out. Planning a trip
used to be fun. Now, it's hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TOO MANY CHOICES? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that we have too many choices today?
</P>
<P>
   I think back to the first time my wife and I decided to vacation
in Europe: There was no Internet. No plethora of free brochures or
reference books beyond the basic all-encompassing guides. No air
fare wars or hotel discounters. We naively approached a travel
agent, cried, ``Help!'' and relied completely on her expertise. She
must have served us well, too, because we were inspired to return
many times.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thousands of Web sites provide insight into attractions
from Africa to Antarctica; we can even click on a computer key and
see photos of hotel rooms in Amsterdam or Hong Kong, or join a chat
room and discuss where to shop or dine. Specialized guidebooks and
periodicals focus on almost every imaginable travel-related topic.
Tour packagers' glossy brochures appeal to increasingly varied
interests.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INFORMATION OVERLOAD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere we turn, someone is bidding to sell us a low-cost
ticket to help make our vacation dreams a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost information overload,'' says Bette LaGow, managing
editor of ``Consumer Reports Best Travel Deals 2000'' (Consumer
Reports, $9.99).
</P>
<P>
   One result, as expressed by LaGow in a recent telephone
interview: ``On a daily basis, you are so bombarded with offers
that it's hard to decipher what the real deal is any more.''
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of adding to this ``information overload,'' LaGow
and other editors at Consumer Reports offer 360 pages of tips aimed
at helping travelers sort the wheat from the chaff. Topics covered
range from airfare know-how to home swaps, car rentals to health
and safety. One chapter is devoted to travel and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is a great place _ it's kind of like a new travel
agent _ but it's enormous,'' LaGow says. ``This book tries to show
people exactly what types of sites are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   LaGow reminds that self-planning online requires sound judgment.
``It's buyer beware,'' she says. ``There is fine print everywhere,
and that includes Web sites. Some of the low airfare sites, for
instance, are a lot better than others at disclosing fees. There
can be a processing fee from $4 to $25 for sending you a paper
ticket as opposed to an e-ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Be wary, LaGow says, of online auctions or other promotions
involving frequent-flier mileage. ``Many of these frequent-flier
miles are not transferable,'' she says. ``I would check directly
with the airline to make sure you're going to be able to use
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other alleged ``super-duper deals'' aren't always what they seem
either. ``If you get a low price on a hotel and it turns out to be
15-20 miles from where you really want to be, requiring you to rent
a car, how good of a deal are you really getting?'' LaGow asks.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who make transactions over the Internet should always
take precautions. Consider these indicators in helping avoid scams:
Look for a security symbol whenever you are asked for sensitive
information such as a credit card number; make certain you know a
company's address (and not just a post office box) and background;
and check for independent seals of approval from the Better
Business Bureau Online (www.bbbonline.org) or TRUSTe
(www.truste.org).
</P>
<P>
   Planning our travels should be enjoyable. But I believe _ and
hope _ my friend is wrong in theorizing that it's better to stay
home than to sort through the maze of alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   I get frustrated sometimes, too. And confused. That's why I give
``Consumer Reports Best Travel Deals 2000'' a prime location on my
bookshelf, just as I do Tom Parsons' ``Insider Travel Secrets''
(Best Fares, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   It's also why when confronted with so many choices, I take
solace in knowing that I can still cry out to my travel agent,
``Help!''

A NEW TENNIS OASIS IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ No black armbands for promoter Charlie
Pasarell. So his three big attractions _ Anna Kournikova, Andre
Agassi, and Serena Williams _ were buried in the desert faster than
you could say Nathalie Dechy, Hicham Arazi, and Mary Pierce, the
mischief-makers who did the spadework. Not all the palm trees were
delivered on time, either, and the bottled water runs out now and
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped worrying about things like that a long time ago,''
said Pasarell, impresario of a tennis tournament, the Indian Wells
Masters, where his star this year was made of steel and concrete,
not flesh and blood. The matinee (and evening) idol, a spiffy new
park called the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, puts Pasarell and his
partners, Ray Moore and International Management Group, in a league
with the old Mongol champ of the 13th century, Kublai Khan.
</P>
<P>
   As you probably recall, the English poet Coleridge wrote: ``In
Xanadu did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure dome decree . . . a sunny
pleasure dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Indian Wells, on the outskirts of Palm Springs, may not
pass for Xanadu, it's a pretty good American approximation. The sun
streams relentlessly, toasting inhabitants and glistening off
encircling snow-kissed mountains. Kublai Khan would have approved
this pleasure pen, and enjoyed lazing among 16,100 patrons, viewing
sneaker-shod combatants in the main arena, an octagonal citadel
rising four levels and 48 rows above the hardcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Pro tennis has been a regular visitor to this desert since 1974,
and Pasarell the promoter at several locations for the last two
decades. The only problem he had at the last site was finding room
for more spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing well, selling out 11,000 seats at the Hyatt
Grand Champions, drawing 152,000 last year,'' said Pasarell. ``But
we needed more room, for courts, hospitality tents _ and
spectators. We came very close to moving to Las Vegas. But that
fell through, and I was pretty depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into my office soon after, and there was a note on the
desk from a realtor named Bill Culver, a very good tennis player,
suggesting the property, 189 acres, on which we've built a $77
million project. What a boost. Especially since I didn't want to
leave this area. We broke ground in November '98 _ and here we are.
And it won't be long before we have an additional 10,000-seat
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Corretja and Lindsay Davenport were crowned the men's and
women's champs over the weekened when the Masters concluded at the
sparkling new facility, which began as a wasteland of cactus and
sagebrush. Years ago, gangsters such as Bugsy Siegel and Meyer
Lansky made the Vegas desert bloom with their gambling playground.
Now the gamesters _ Pasarell, Moore, IMG _ have planted their own
garden for gamboling racket-flappers, and are well on the way to
establishing the planet's prime tennis patch.
</P>
<P>
   In the US, Miami's Crandall Park, scene of the upcoming Ericsson
(nee Lipton) Open, has been the paragon, with a 14,000-seat
stadium. Now Pasarell and Moore are catching up with their pal and
former colleague of the courts, Butch Buchholz, who built Crandall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch has encouraged us every step of the way, helping us not
to make mistakes,'' said Pasarell. ``He's got the ocean view on Key
Biscayne. We've got the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the US Tennis Association had neither Pasarell
nor Buchholz influencing the construction of monstrous Arthur Ashe
Stadium at Flushing Meadow three years ago. The overblown
23,000-seat arena offers a decent spectating experience only to
those in the highest-priced seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is more disappointed by that than Pasarell since Ashe,
his college roommate and teammate at UCLA, was his closest friend.
A statue of Ashe and numerous photos are prominently positioned in
Pasarell's office.
</P>
<P>
   The same architect, Gino Rossetti, did the three stadia
excellently, tailoring his work to differing demands. The USTA went
for greed in ordering too many seats (but too few, and at too great
a distance for ordinary pocketbooks). Buchholz and Pasarell went
for grace, gratifying their customers. Anything exceeding 16,000
seats defeats a true intimate tennis atmosphere, and there isn't a
bad location here.
</P>
<P>
   It may take players who've been around to create the right
setting for their game. Pasarell and Buchholz played Davis Cup for
the US, Moore for South Africa, where he had the style and chutzpah
to speak out against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly this stadium would have been named for their friend,
Ashe, had the USTA not wisely chosen to honor an exemplary American
(rejecting an earlier decision to sell naming rights).
</P>
<P>
   That tasteless practice of hanging commercial names on
playgrounds was avoided, said Pasarell, ``because the city gave us
$2.5 million to call it the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Unique, and
a nice feel, don't you think?'' Preferable to the Taco Bell
Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller outer stadia are sunken for better viewing, and so are
the unusual practice courts. Pasarell noted, ``Fans love to watch
practice, and we'll make it easy for them with seating.''
</P>
<P>
   A rugged serve-and-volleyer, Pasarell was No. 1 in the US in
1967, and lost a US Amateur semifinal to champ Stan Smith two years
later at Longwood in Brookline, Mass. He has a golfer's memory _
virtually unheard of among tennis players _ and can replay every
point and match if you ask.
</P>
<P>
   His mind was also a storehouse for ideas, items and details he
would use _ as he has _ when he outbuilt Kublai Khan with his own
pleasure dome.

DRAINING HOOPS ALL WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gus Johnson typifies the all-out effort by CBS in covering the
unpredictable, bracket-busting NCAA men's basketball tournament. Of
the six games he covered in Tucson, only one was a blowout and four
were decided by 6 points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first game of the West Regional was Purdue beating
Dayton by a point. He also called the startling Gonzaga win over
St. John's in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday night, Johnson said he was ``emotionally drained.''
But he caught a red-eye back to New York to do play-by-play for the
Knicks-Lakers game on Madison Square Garden Network radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you,'' Johnson said. ``By the end of the
Knicks game, I was out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's coverage of the first and second rounds was comprehensive
and outstanding, and while nitpickers have criticized the network
for not instantly interrupting some games with hotter contests, CBS
did everything but split the screen to provide viewers with
breaking game information.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's feature reports were excellent, too, particularly
the ``Road to the Final Four'' piece narrated by Greg Gumbel
Saturday. CBS caught Valparaiso coach Homer Drew telling his
players that the NCAA tournament was ``a whole lot of emotion and
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew is correct, and CBS captured the emotion without being
syrupy. Once known for being staid and conservative, CBS even used
music from Led Zepplin as background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs a little Jimmy Page in their day,'' said
Gumbel, a rock-and-roll connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other team, Gonzaga has been on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are stone cold killers,'' said Johnson. ``They definitely
can go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that Gonzaga has a great combination of perimeter
and inside players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hard basketball players and are pumped and ready to
go,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS analyst Clark Kellogg said he was not surprised by Gonzaga
and went so far as to say there weren't a lot of true upsets in the
tourney, even though lower seeds were beating higher seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that much different between 3 seeds and 7 seeds,''
Kellogg explained. ``College basketball is much more balanced now,
which means more compelling, competitive games.''
</P>
<P>
   He said only three games were upsets: North Carolina beating
Stanford, Wisconsin beating Arizona, and Seton Hall beating Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg predicts that the UCLA-Iowa State game will be one of
the most exciting in recent memory. Iowa State guard Jamal Tinsley,
said Kellogg, ``brings all of Brooklyn with him'' when he plays.
And UCLA smoked a good Maryland team by 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone hasn't noticed, Kellogg likes to throw in a few
flavorful terms to spice up his analysis. His best one over the
weekend was ``equi-finality,'' loosely defined as a team's ability
to reach the Final Four in a number of different ways _ defense,
perimeter shooting, fast breaks, or inside-the-paint play.
</P>
<P>
   He used ``equi-finality'' during a break in the
Syracuse-Kentucky game as he was talking about the Wildcats'
multiple weapons. Unfortunately, Kentucky didn't use all of those
weapons and lost to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next round
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's TV games are Michigan State-Syracuse at 7:38,
followed by UCLA-Iowa State around 9:55 p.m. Both will be called by
Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery, with Armen Keteyian reporting.
Friday night's action starts with Duke-Florida at 7:38, followed by
Oklahoma State-Seton Hall. Jim Nantz and Billy Packer call those
games, with Bonnie Bernstein reporting . . . Ratings for NBC's big
Lakers-Knicks matchup Sunday were down 30 percent from the NBA
telecast on the same weekend last year. The Lakers' blowout earned
a 4 rating and 10 share, but last year's Lakers-Magic game pulled a
5.7 rating and 14 share. . . NBC's ratings for the Bay Hill Classic
were up 20 percent, with Tiger Woods winning yet again. NBC earned
a 5.3 rating and 11 share; last year's tournament pulled a 4.4
rating and 9 share.

WIDE GULFS BARED AS RUSSIA ADMITS A CHECHNYA MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia _ At first, the Russian soldiers who burst
into Marina Ismailova's yard wanted only money.
</P>
<P>
   When her father-in-law, Akhmed Abulkhanov, was able to produce
only 300 rubles _ about $10.50 _ the soldiers demanded more.
Another relative brought out an American hundred dollar bill from
the house. Still not satisfied, the soldiers opened fire on the
68-year-old Abulkhanov. They also shot two neighbors who rushed to
see about the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the shots,'' Ismailova recalled of that day last month
in Aldy, a suburb of Chechnya's capital, Grozny. ``My father-in-law
died, along with our neighbors the Abdulmezhidovs, a brother and
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was what survivors and human rights groups call
the worst massacre in Russia's six-month campaign to reconquer
Chechnya from separatist militants.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, which originally denied that any killings took
place, acknowledged the deaths for the first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ismailova and other residents describe a three-hour rampage of
looting and systematic slayings that they say epitomizes the
Russians' hatred and disregard of the Chechen civilians whose lives
they were sent to protect. At least 46 people were killed, though
some survivors say the toll was as high as 82.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Aldy is more than the story of an alleged
massacre. It is also a story of the difficulty of establishing the
truth in a war where independent observers have little access to
first-hand information.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow at first denied that anyone died in Aldy on Feb. 5, or
anytime. The Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhebmsky,
charged that accounts of the shootings were fabricated by
supporters of Islamic rebels and that journalists who reported them
were ``on the side of the Mujaheddin.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Yastrzhembsky appeared to change his story, saying a
criminal prosecutor had opened an investigation into the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the culprits are identified they will naturally be
punished,'' he said at a briefing in Moscow. But he said there was
no proof that Russian soldiers were responsible. Authorities have
not allowed Western journalists to visit Aldy since Russian troops
regained control of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The vast difference in the Russian and Chechen accounts that
prevailed until Monday highlights the gulf of mutual mistrust
dividing the military and the local population, a problem that will
probably hobble Russia's efforts to bring peace to Chechnya even if
its troops defeat the rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechen civilians decried the rampant kidnapping and
lawlessness that swept Chechnya after rebels drove out Russian
troops following a brutal 1994-1996 conflict. When the Russians
returned last October, many seemed willing to accept Moscow's rule
if it brought peace. But a series of reported attacks on civilians
have turned many of those Chechens against the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The events in Aldy could have profound implications for Russia's
future relations with the West if Russian troops did commit
atrocities, and the Kremlin is found to be covering up.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a senior US official visiting Moscow said he had
warned Russian leaders to investigate reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them how they handle this matter means a lot to how
they will be perceived in the United States and the world,'' said
the administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky on Friday charged that the Western media have been
ignoring abuses by the separatists while unfairly blaming the
Russian military for war crimes that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deny this information, I deny it as I have always denied
it,'' he said at a meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia's chief military prosecutor last week denied any
knowledge of shootings by Russian soldiers in Aldy, Yastrzhembsky
said that exhumation of victims' bodies has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Four people who described themselves as survivors of the events
in Aldy gave their accounts to the Globe after fleeing Grozny. Only
two wanted their names used. Their stories are remarkably
consistent with accounts provided by other survivors to Human
Rights Watch, the New York-based organization that first reported
on the shootings in Aldy in late February.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors all described a large group of Russian soldiers
who rounded up civilians, ostensibly to check documents and search
for rebels who might be hiding in the houses. Instead, the
residents say, the soldiers summarily killed civilians in their
homes and on the streets. All the accounts describe soldiers
demanding money and burning numerous houses.
</P>
<P>
   Toita Estemirova, 29, who was nine months pregnant, was killed.
So was her husband, Khozhakhmed Estamirov, 37, and their 1-year-old
son, Khassan, and his grandfather, Khasmagomed, 67 and disabled.
The family had left Aldy last fall but returned to their house on
Podolskaya Street as the fighting for Grozny subsided, figuring it
would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Matash Mazayev Street, not far from Ismailova's home, Rizvan
Umkhayev, 70, was shot to death. He was found lying on the ground
with his open passport in his hands. Sultan Timurov, 67, who lived
nearby, was found decapitated. The residents searched for his head
for several days but eventually gave up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the survivors, Acet Chirayeva, 33, a trained nurse, said
she had treated wounded and helped bury the dead. She said
residents had found 82 bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about 12 noon on Feb. 5, I heard the first shots on the
streets. My father and I went out and we saw Russian soldiers
burning the houses,'' Chirayeva recalled. ``Their commander told
me, `Organize as soon as possible burial of the dead. The guys here
just blew away some of your old men.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people Chirayeva said she buried were 72-year-old
Rakhiyat Akhmatova, who was killed after she handed over her gold
ring and a necklace, and Magomed Gaitayev, 70.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch also alleged
that Russian soldiers had raped at least two women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that this is sheer rape, murder, and pillage,''
said Human Rights Watch spokesman Malcom Hawkes, who conducted some
of the interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Details given by the survivors indicate that the shootings were
carried out by a maverick paramilitary police unit that ran amok,
rather than as part of official policy. All the survivors mentioned
another group of Russian soldiers who tried to warn residents
before the alleged massacre, and helped some to hide.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether any of those killed were rebel fighters.
Over a dozen men of fighting age appear on the list of 46 victims
whose names, birthdates, and addresses have been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The list was compiled by survivors. Federal authorities give
daily information on rebel losses and weekly updates of Russian
casualties. But they have made no count of civilian casualties in
the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to count civilian casualties,'' Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors denied that any Chechen fighters were in Aldy that
day. But this is a claim often made by Chechen civilians, and often
it has proved to be untrue. Russian paramilitary police troops
interviewed in Grozny last month said they were often fired upon
from places where security sweeps had turned up no fighters.
</P>
<P>
   One special forces officer who fought in the two-month battle
for Grozny said the troops do not trust any Chechens _ including
children, old men, and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children often signal our positions to rebel snipers,'' said
the officer, who only gave his first name, Ruslan. ``Women often
fight alongside the men. Old men _ they are sometimes fighters,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents say all rebel fighters left Aldy as the separatists
withdrew from Grozny in early February. By Feb. 4, Russian troops
had agreed to stop shelling Aldy after meeting with local residents
who assured them no fighters were there.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, an estimated 2,000 people remained in Aldy; most of
the prewar population of 27,000 had fled, said a senior official in
the district's prewar administration who asked to remain anonymous.
He said about 75 people from Aldy had died during the two-month
siege of Grozny; another 82 died on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, Aldy residents said they complained to the commander
of the nearest Russian troops. The officer, they said, dismissed
the whole incident as a mistake and told them the soldiers had been
drunk. He promised they would be punished.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors say they buried the bodies near where they died,
hoping journalists would come. A few days later, several armed men
in military fatigues appeared, identifying themselves as
``journalists.'' They asked to see the witnesses. People were
afraid to talk to them. Later, Russian soldiers ordered them to
move the bodies to the local cemetery. Residents said they feared
the troops would try to cover up the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Russia denies killing the civilians. The dying continues. Every
day, Chechens receive news of the deaths of family members in areas
occupied by federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was Sultan Shakhbulatov, a refugee from Chechnya
who fled south to Georgia, who learned that his pregnant niece,
Estemirova, had been killed in Aldy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never return as long as the Russians are in Chechnya,''
he concluded. ``So we will have to drive them out.''

STORY OF THE FAMED TEXAS RANGERS GIVES EXCITING LOOK AT HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``The men who wear the star: The story of the Texas Rangers''; By
Charles M. Robinson III; Random House, $29.95.) 
 
By BOB TUTT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades after revolutionaries wrested Texas from Mexico, the
blood continued to flow. Warfare raged between Texans and American
Indians. Assorted feuds snuffed lives, as did battles against an
abundance of badmen.
</P>
<P>
   If all the blood staining this state's history were miraculously
recovered, our blood banks could forget about donors for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Of necessity, this bloodshed must be an integral part of Charles
M. Robinson III's ``The Men Who Wear the Star: The Story of the
Texas Rangers.'' Blending admiration and dispassion, Robinson
offers a balanced view of the Rangers, who during their long
history have been lionized as heroes and served as lightning rods
for controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The first Rangers were like the Colonial minutemen who protected
people living on the American frontier and ultimately fought for
independence from the British.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Robinson writes, ``The Ranger was a unique frontiersman on
a unique frontier, for in all the annals of the American West there
was nothing quite like Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Its settlers, he explains, ``depended on the citizen-ranger far
more than on any soldier or sheriff, because he was one of them and
he knew the dangers they faced.''
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing danger came from Indian raids, especially by
Comanches and their Kiowa allies. Tribal braves strived to
demonstrate their manhood during designated annual raiding seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empresario'' Stephen F. Austin introduced the Ranger concept
in Texas about 1823 to protect ``a colony beyond the pale of white
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Republic of Texas emerged in 1836, it expanded Ranger
forces, offering rank-and-file members $25 a month plus 1,280 acres
of public land for each year they served. Their officers got higher
pay, with captains getting the most, $75 a month.
</P>
<P>
   These first Rangers served primarily in locally raised companies
rather than as a Texaswide corps. Robinson notes that as ``horsemen
and guerrilla fighters, the Texans and the Indians were about
evenly matched, and Indian fights often were inconclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the early Rangers were good guys, he writes. A few
Ranger companies actually turned out to be outlaw gangs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest early Rangers was Capt. John Coffee Hays,
better known as Jack Hays, a Tennessee native. His slight build and
boyish appearance made him look much younger than he was, but
Nelson Lee, who served under him, knew him as ``a lamb in peace''
but ``a lion in war.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most famous feats (often embellished in the
retelling) was single-handedly holding off a Comanche band after
being separated from his men. He took refuge atop Enchanted Rock,
an immense granite dome near what is now Fredericksburg, and
escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson says the average Ranger's life expectancy during this
pre-Civil War period was about two years. Awareness of their peril
seems to have spurred them to make the most of leisure time.
Topping their pleasures were drinking, cock fights and the favors
of women.
</P>
<P>
   Though often tending to be insubordinate, Rangers served
valiantly in the Mexican-American War, triggered by the United
States' annexation of Texas. Led by Jack Hays, Rangers helped
counter Mexican guerrillas who harassed U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   During that war some Rangers ``gave the service a reputation for
brutality that still lingers,'' Robinson writes, but ``the fame of
the organization had spread. ... The Texas Rangers were becoming a
legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians continued to regard Texans as a people apart from other
Americans even after Texas formally entered the Union in 1846,
Robinson relates, and although they were at peace with the federal
government, they continued their raids in Texas. Things reached the
point that traveling outside Austin, the state's capital, could be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849 the federal government agreed to bankroll formation of
three Ranger companies to deal with this Indian peril.
</P>
<P>
   Among those distinguishing themselves was another storied
Ranger, Capt. John Salmon Ford. He became known as Rip Ford because
he signed letters of condolence to families of deceased Rangers
``RIP (rest in peace)/ Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1850s Ford would also notably serve in the so-called
Cortina War fought along the Mexican border against forces led by
Juan Cortina, a revolutionary who deplored what he saw as American
exploitation of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War famed Ranger leaders such as Ford, Sul Ross
and Bill McCulloch gained added stature serving the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Ranger unit known as the Frontier Regiment worked
to protect Texans along the northern and western frontiers. The
state of Texas and the South could provide it scant if any support.
</P>
<P>
   Indian attacks in the closing days of 1863 and the year 1864
``were among the worst in the history of Texas,'' Robinson writes.
</P>
<P>
   He recounts how these problems continued during the upheaval of
the Reconstruction era before 14 companies of Rangers called
Frontier Forces and designated as auxiliaries of the U.S. Army took
the field against Indian raiders.
</P>
<P>
   These Texas Rangers, Robinson writes, ``were the men who created
the lasting image that has inspired so many motion pictures,
television series and pulp novels.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1874 the Legislature ``established the Rangers as a
permanent, professional statewide gendarmerie,'' he explains. ``The
era of the citizen Ranger was over. For the duration of their
enlistments the men of the Frontier Battalion had no occupation in
life save as Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, he adds, the Rangers had civil police
powers. This ``brought them into closer touch with law-abiding
people,'' making them peace officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger Sgt. James B. Gillett would later observe, ``This new
work was less romantic than the old Indian warfare, but it was
every bit as dangerous and necessary in the building up of the fast
developing state.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Robinson explains, ``The Texas Rangers were now
subject to a discipline and organization that they had never before
known. ... Henceforth they would be professionals, obeying orders,
serving where ordered and when ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   In their future were such outlaws as elusive, shrewd John King
Fisher, described by one Ranger as ``the most perfect specimen of a
frontier dandy and desperado.''
</P>
<P>
   His base of operation was West Texas, and by the time he was 26
he claimed to have killed 26 men. He was running unopposed for
sheriff of Uvalde County when killed during a drunken brawl in a
San Antonio saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably ``the champion desperado of the world'' was John Wesley
Hardin, a preacher's son known to have killed 27 men. He fled to
Florida, but Rangers tracked him down and returned him to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Using what Robinson describes as ``a finely tuned sense of
public relations,'' Hardin charmed the press and the public and
ultimately managed to be tried on only one murder charge. He
escaped being hanged when the jury found him guilty in the second
degree in the slaying of a deputy sheriff. He drew a 25-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin was released and pardoned after serving almost 16 years
in prison and became a lawyer practicing in El Paso. Ultimately
another gunman, John Selman, cowardly murdered him by shooting him
in the back.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1880s, Robinson observes, Rangers had begun putting more
emphasis on employing due process of law rather than ``a rope or a
firearm'' to administer justice.
</P>
<P>
   But they regressed in the 20th century as revolution engulfed
Mexico and they had to deal with banditry along the border. In one
instance, Rangers seriously strained U.S.-Mexican relations by
callously dumping in brush country bodies of Mexicans they had
killed in a gun battle.
</P>
<P>
   The overall quality of the Rangers dipped when James E. ``Farmer
Jim'' Ferguson took office as governor in 1915 and allowed
patronage and cronyism to guide the filling of state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Upheaval along the border gave Ferguson the opportunity to
create units of Special Rangers. In January 1918 some of these
Rangers massacred 15 Hispanic men and youths in Porvenir, a Big
Bend-area village. The lawmen coldbloodedly perpetrated this
slaughter despite not finding the evidence of banditry they sought.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year a patronage scandal led the Legislature to
impeach Ferguson, then oust him from office. The lawmakers also
abolished his Special Rangers and made provisions for citizens to
have redress for Ranger misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ferguson climbed back in the saddle in the 1920s when
his wife, Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson, served two nonconsecutive terms
as governor. Robinson notes that ``one of her first acts was to
discharge the entire Ranger Service,'' then to commission 2,300
``special'' Rangers that included some who were convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he writes, Rangers like Frank Hamer, who tracked
down the Bonnie and Clyde crime duo, ``managed to uphold the
integrity of the service.'' The Rangers were merged with the
Highway Patrol in 1935 to form the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   But, sad to say, much blood still flows in Texas as it enters a
new century.

&HT;     GUESS WHO'S COMING TO COLLEGE? `SHAGM' AND FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ To all eyes, Kent Vander Wal is a model
student. He scored 1,300 on his Scholastic Assessment Test, jammed
his schedule with Advance Placement courses and ranked 14th in his
high school class.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of his e-mail name:
``Sellthekidsforfood.'' It wouldn't matter much, except the name
was on Kent's on-line application to Union College in Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has introduced an unexpected element of whimsy to
the world of college admissions. In addition to ranks, scores,
essays wishing for world peace and deep thoughts about the
millennium, colleges now learn that applicants like to be called
``Crazyclown,'' ``Shagm'' and ``Ipitydafoo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can picture it: Some of these kids got an America Online
account as a sophomore. There were too many Malcolms or Danielles
and they got this handle that's adolescent and a little brash,''
said Dan Lundquist, vice president of admissions at Union College.
``Then, all of the sudden, they're a senior trying to have a
dignified discussion with an admissions director _ with the name
`Sexwaxman.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most students, like ``Sexwaxman'' (named after a popular brand
of surfboard wax), react sheepishly when asked about their on-line
identities, Lundquist said. ``Zipdude,'' another prospect, went to
great lengths to convince Lundquist that he would change his e-mail
address immediately and that he was a serious student who liked
going to the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal makes no such apologies. ``Sellthekidsforfood''
loudly proclaims his differentness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Vander Wal is known for a van plastered with rock
bumper stickers that has become something of a ``town artifact,''
and for his strange passion for sledding in tow behind cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too smart,'' he said of his winter hobby. ``It's
pretty dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet name came to him while he and a friend worked at a
pizza shop in Kalamazoo, Mich. The name comes from a lyric in the
song ``In Bloom'' by the band Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   They were just kids complaining about money, he said. Vander
Wal, a top student and football player, isn't worried that college
admissions staff will misconstrue his meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't understand, that's their problem,'' he said. ``I
am who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, having an over-the-top e-mail address will not
kill your chances of getting into Union College. Admissions staff
pay far more attention to essays, which tend to reveal a student's
character and history, Lundquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are essays that get into misogyny and racism and handle
them badly,'' he said. ``We don't want to accept someone who's
going to be a ticking time bomb for the dean of students.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, Lundquist has found the best students are
willing to take risks. One recent candidate from Suffolk County,
Long Island, got an almost perfect score on her college boards,
speaks several languages and acts like she's ``17 going on 30,''
Lundquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The student likes to be called ``Xmassox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an adorable little insight,'' said Lundquist, who is
now in his third grueling month of reviewing applications. ``I
wonder what `Xmassox' means to that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of risk wasn't lost on Tyson Hubbard. His e-mail
handle, ``Ipitydafoo,'' came to him three years ago when he saw
``Rocky III'' star Mr. T on cable. ``He kept on saying `I pity the
fool,' and I just thought it was hilarious,'' said Hubbard, of
Auburn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to apply for college, Hubbard wondered if
it didn't sound unprofessional. He ultimately decided to keep it,
if only to round out his lofty resume: No. 5 in the class;
president of the student body, choir and the drama club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think it presents a complete picture of who I am,''
he said. ``I mean, I like to have fun, too.''

MEN, WOMEN, VACATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's more proof (if you needed any) that women and men are
different. A survey by Hilton found that:
</P>
<P>
   --Seven out of 10 women say they get more pleasure out of
vacations than possessions. Only 55 percent of men say that.
</P>
<P>
   --On average, the longest vacation taken by men _ 19 days or so
_ is about two days more than the longest trip by women.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly 20 percent of women want to renew contact with loved
ones while on vacation. Only 13 percent of men do.
</P>
<P>
   --Forty-seven percent of women feel they get to know themselves
again while on vacation. The figure for men is 42 percent. &QL;

Travel Trivia: A recent trivia question on flags has inspired
another from a reader. What is the only country with a
monochromatic flag? And which country has a non-rectangular banner?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL;

In a name: Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, derives its name
from an Old English term meaning a tress of holy hair. &QL;

Quotable: ``It is good to have an end to journey towards; but it is
the journey that matters, in the end'' _ Ursula K. Le Guin,

 &QL; 
Event to remember: Mike the Headless Chicken Days, celebrated in
the western Colorado town of Fruta, honors a 1940s Wyandotte
rooster who is said to have lived two years without a head. This
year's festival, May 19-20, will feature chicken bingo, egg tosses,
polka dances, chicken joke contests, a microbrewery competition,
and a 5K Run-Like-A-Headless-Chicken Race. For more information
about Colorado events, visit www.colorado.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Ocean City, N.J., it is against the law to
slurp your soup at a restaurant. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Guess you'll just have to buy one: For those who have asked,
Guinness will not be holding its ``Win a Pub in Ireland'' contest
this year. After six years, it's giving the contest a rest. Last
year's competition drew more than 70,000 entries. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: The National Watch and Clock Museum in
Columbia, Pa., just keeps on ticking. Its hundreds of timepieces
cover the history of timekeeping from early nonmechanical devices
to today's atomic and radio-controlled clocks. There are German
musical clocks, a clock with 48 moving figures, and an 11-foot-tall
French statue clock. There are also exhibits on tools, art, and
models. The museum is at 514 Poplar St., Columbia, PA 17512-2130;
phone 717-684-8261, fax 717-684-0142, Web page

Home, not-so-sweet home: The government of Romania is preparing to
give tourists a chance to stay in the home once occupied by the
brutal dictator Nicolas Ceausescu and his fur-loving wife, Elena.

Candyland: Chicago, of all places, is the candy capital of the
world, according to the National Confectioners Association. The
candy industry employs 13,000 people at about 100 companies in the
Chicago area. Those people make $4 billion worth of candy every
year. Chicago's candy business got going in the 1800s because the
city was a transportation hub and manufacturing center, and milk
and corn syrup were readily available. &QL;

WITH ICE THINNING, CANADA CLAIMS THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE BAY, Nunavut Territory _ The ice packs that block
navigation across the top of the world are thinning as Earth's
climate warms, raising the likelihood that commercial shipping and
military vessels will soon routinely ply these long-frozen seaways.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid retreat of the ice is also opening the way to direct
challenges to Canada's control over the waters of its vast northern
realms _ above all, its claim to the legendary Northwest Passage.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic changes in one of the world's most vulnerable
environmental zones and critical strategic arenas are making
reality of the ancient dream of an east-west sea lane that would
shave thousands of miles from the ocean routes between the markets
of Asia and those of Europe and eastern North America.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be the biggest change in global shipping
patterns since the construction of the Panama Canal, completed in
1914.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extraordinary international issues are quite literally riding
on thin ice,'' said Rob Huebert, associate director of the Center
for Military and Strategic Studies at Alberta's University of
Calgary, a specialist on Arctic issues. ``At stake is control of a
sea lane of potentially major importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over the right to transit the northern channels
have for decades been a source of usually low-key but occasionally
bitter diplomatic sparring between the United States and Canada. It
was a debate, in any event, over an abstraction, since the channels
were so clogged by pack ice even during summer months as to make
passage impossible to all but mighty icebreakers and
specially-designed research vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But soon Canada may find itself pitted against not only its
powerful southern neighbor but also seagoing nations around the
world _ including Russia, Japan, and nearly every European country
with ocean ports _ over its claim to own the northern waterways.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict that could test the limits of diplomacy. The
commander of Canadian forces in the far north said in an interview
that he anticipates his country may be required to use firepower to
enforce its claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``National security, the safety of native coastal communities,
and the protection of an extremely vulnerable ecology are at
stake,'' said Colonel Pierre Leblanc, commander of Canada's
northern military zone, embracing 1.5 million square miles of
frozen barrens. ``When it comes to these, Canada can be a very
tough country. We will defend our interests and our honor, with
force, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs that major sea powers may be quietly
probing the seas of the Canadian Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 16, Inuit fishermen stared in disbelief as a strange
and threatening sea beast burst from the frigid waters of
Cumberland Sound, near the hamlet of Pangnirtung. This was no
whale.
</P>
<P>
   First loomed the conning tower and then the riveted steel skin
of a submarine moving at speed, seven-foot wave curling off the
dark bow.
</P>
<P>
   An alert was sent to Canadian Forces northern region
headquarters in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. As orders and
queries bounced back and forth across the country, a squadron of
CP-140 Aurora maritime patrol planes lifted from a base in
Greenwood, Nova Scotia. But by the time the submarine hunters had
flown the 1,600-mile distance _ and peppered the ice-flecked waves
with sonar buoys _ the quarry had vanished to the deep.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more submarine sightings over the next two weeks,
but only by Inuit villagers untrained in vessel identification.
From their descriptions of the warcraft, however, Canadian military
analysts suspect the submarine was French or American.
</P>
<P>
   If the mysterious incursion did not pose a true military threat,
it did represent a slap at Canadian sovereignty over its vast
Arctic archipelago _ a humilitation that has left the country's
downsized military quietly seething.
</P>
<P>
   Worse may be yet to come. Scientists and military specialists
warn that far more direct, even hostile, challenges are likely to
question Canada's claims to control the sea passages between the
North Atlantic and some of Asia's most important ports.
</P>
<P>
   The ice packs that cover much of the Canadian Arctic are
receding and thinning at rates that scientists describe as
alarming, reflecting a planetwide warming trend.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has been much ballyhooed by environmentalists,
some of whom predict flooding of coastal cities and catastrophic
changes in climate. Doomsday scenarios aside, the sea change is
also being watched closely by seagoing powers, especially the
United States, as well as by hard-headed international shipping
executives from Tokyo to Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waters are opening, this is not science fiction,'' said
Andre Maillet, head of Arctic icebreaking operations for the
Canadian Coast Guard. ``Whether it's a few years away or a couple
decades, the passage is going to become a vital commercial channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shipping companies already have their eye on the route,''
he said. ``And they are not going to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a bit of nautical history-making that attracted
almost no notice, a Russian ocean tug, the Irbis, last fall hauled
a huge floating dry dock through the icy labyrinth _ traveling from
Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula to Freeport, Bahamas _ the
first industrial transit of the Northwest Passage by a non-Canadian
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The name Northwest Passage refers to several possible routes
through the maze of sounds, gulfs, channels, and straits that
transect an almost incomprehensibly vast and barely-populated
region, and Canada says it is an internal waterway. It says that
Ottawa alone has the authority to regulate shipping and, above all,
to set the environmental rules for the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's primary fear is the environmental havoc that would be
caused by a ruptured oil tanker or the wreck of an ordinary
container ship. The few creatures that survive in the frozen
barrens are perhaps more susceptible to pollution than in any other
part of the world because the food chain is so thin.
</P>
<P>
   But overriding even ecological concerns are worries about
national sovereignty and whether Canada can enforce territorial
claims to its empire of ice-capped islands. The country is already
proving rich in oil, gas, diamonds, gold, and other mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadians see the north as part of their heritage,'' said
Chris Sands, a Canadian affairs analyst with the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Affairs. ``It's an extremely
sensitive issue.''
</P>
<P>
   So a country known for its soft voice on defense matters may
find itself forced to take a very hard line on the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Canadian waters,'' said Leblanc, responsible for the
defense of a military zone stretching from the Alaska border to the
Davis Strait off Greenland, but inhabited by only 90,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many seafaring powers, most stridently the United States, take a
radically different view of the Northwest Passage, claiming that
the channels threading through the Canadian Arctic form an
international waterway and must be freely navigable to all
commercial ships and naval fleets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our firm position that Canada has no more right to
restrict the Northwest Passage than Malaysia has to restrict the
Strait of Malacca,'' said one senior official in Washington,
referring to the heavily-trafficked sea lane between the Indian and
Pacific oceans. ``These are world waters.''
</P>
<P>
   To make its point, the United States has twice in recent decades
enraged Canada by sending ships through the ice without permission
_ the experimental heavy-hulled oil tanker Manhattan in 1969 and
the icebreaker Polar Sea in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fury provoked in Ottawa, the American voyages were
basically symbolic exercises, since only specially-designed ships
could make the treacherous transit from the North Atlantic to the
Beaufort Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But now many analysts predict that within a decade or so, the
ice floes will thin or recede so much for at least six months of
the year that the fabled passage will be navigable by container
vessels, tankers, and luxury cruise ships with only modestly
reinforced hulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant shortcut from Europe to Japan and other
parts of Asia,'' said Sands. ``For the US, it would make shipping
of crude oil from Alaska to Boston, or anywhere on the eastern
seaboard, economically feasible for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most keen on the route are owners of ships plying between
Western Europe and Japan, South Korea, Siberia, and northeastern
China. To make that journey via the Panama Canal, vessels must
travel 12,600 nautical miles. The best route through the Canadian
Arctic, by contrast, would cover a bit less than 8,000 nautical
miles, which would mean savings in fuel, time, and crew salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Arctic channels are opening at a time when
shipping companies are fretting about possible political
instablity, corruption, and technical breakdowns in Panama, now
that the United States has relinquished control over the historic
canal, which may prove too narrow to handle the next generation of
supertankers and mammoth container ships.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the passage would be the fruition of a goal sought for
centuries by European explorers seeking a shorter sea route to the
the Far East. In 1576, Martin Frobisher made it to the tip of
Baffin Island, in present-day Nunavut. Henry Hudson combed the
great bay that bears his name in 1610 but was thwarted in his dream
of discovering a new way to China. John Franklin and his crew died
after resorting to cannibalism when his two ships were trapped in
ice 1847.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1905, a plucky Norwegian, Roald Amundsen, completed
a two-year voyage in a refitted herring boat to become the first to
successfully navigate the entire Northwest Passage. Like the moon
landing later in the century, however, Amundsen's journey was an
epic achievement with no real practical significance. Until very
recently, the route he charted remained dangerous and essentially
off-limits to all except adventurers, scientific researchers, and
flag-waving exercises, such as those mounted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Alaska-based cruise ships are starting to ply sections
of the passage, sometimes asking Canadian permission _ sometimes
not. In a weird episode last summer, a Chinese government vessel
landed at the tiny fishing port of Tuktoyaktuk without notice. A
few crew members disembarked, wandering about and snapping photos
until the local constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
started asking questions. The Chinese then reboarded and steamed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all Canada's tough talk about defending Arctic sea
routes and national sovereignty, the country has only a token
military presence in the far north: 200 soldiers, sailors, and
aviators belonging to the regular military, plus 1,500 Indian and
Inuit belonging to irregular Ranger units.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military sees the dangers _ environmental, national
security and the prospect of new smuggling routes _ and is trying
hard to think of ways to deal with the issues before the passage
becomes trafficked, (and) it's too late,'' said Huebert, the
University of Calgary political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Canada, the military doesn't set national priorities,''
he said. ``And the politicians who do just aren't thinking about
this. The far north is too far away, even to Canadians.''

LATECOMER FALLS FOR JUDO WITH OLYMPIAN EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEEKONK, Mass. _ It was the fermented mare's milk that did it.
Joe Felton was sitting at a feast somewhere in Uzbekistan when
someone handed him a tumbler of the regional beverage _ just like
Trigger used to drink. ``That's when it hit me,'' Felton says.
``What the hell am I doing here? How did I get here?''
</P>
<P>
   He was an ex-Detroit Lion who'd been working as a personal
trainer down by the Rhode Island border. Now Felton's an ippon or
two away from Olympus, from getting a ticket to Sydney with the US
judo team at 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much unheard of,'' says Jimmy Pedro, the world
champion from Lawrence who is favored to win the gold medal in the
lightweight class. ``For someone who started as late as Joe did,
it's almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Most judo players start hanging out at the dojo as children.
Felton didn't step onto the mat until he was 29, but got himself to
the world championships in just three years.
</P>
<P>
   Being a heavyweight _ Felton is 6 feet 2 inches, 280 pounds _
undoubtedly helped. There are so few of them in judo that a good
athlete with quick hands and feet, discipline and poise, and a
patient coach can become a contender in much less than a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Peter Contardo and Mike Nees were thinking when they
saw Felton walk into a pizza joint half a dozen years ago. ``Look
at the size of him,'' Contardo marveled to Nees. ``What do you
think? Wouldn't he make a great heavyweight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever done judo?'' Nees asked Felton. He might as well have
said: ``Ever done jai alai?'' Though he lives in Fall River now,
Felton comes from Michigan, where most folks don't know judo from
Judas. ``It's either football or wrestling there,'' says Felton.
``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton was an offensive guard from Saginaw, good enough to be
offered a full ride to Michigan from Bo Schembechler. But after
Felton tore up his knee and the Big Ten lost interest, he ended up
at Albion, a Division 3 school between Ann Arbor and Battle Creek
where he made small college All-America.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL players went on strike in 1987, Felton went to the
cattle call for replacement players and found himself starting for
the Lions. Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's a UAW member who works for GM,'' Felton says. ``I
said, Dad, I'm going to be a scab. He said, for $6,000 a week, I
don't care what you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Detroit fans, especially when the ersatz Lions beat
the Packers on the road in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved us,'' Felton recalls. ``We were the Lions who were
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook fantasy lasted three games, until the regulars
returned. So Felton played Arena Football with the New England
Steamrollers and Detroit Drive and wangled a few NFL tryouts, one
of them with the Patriots in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cold, wintery, rainy and I was running 4.6s,'' he
remembers. ``My hamstring just bunched up on me, and that was
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Felton decided it was time to hang up the pads for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been in and out of pro football and I was getting tired of
it,'' he says. ``So I took a couple of years and just goofed
around, figuring out what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton taught as a substitute in the Fall River schools. He ran
a center for juvenile delinquents. He did some personal training.
But except for some stay-in-shape powerlifting, he was out of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Until Contardo and Nees persuaded Felton to drop by the dojo and
have a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come here and you train and you do what you're supposed
to,'' Nees told him, ``I'll get you to the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   All Felton had to do was start from Page 1, work out two and
three times a day for a couple of years, go overseas for months at
a time _ and forget every instinct he'd had on a gridiron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always been trained to attack,' he says. ``In football,
you learn to be aggressive. In judo, you have to be passive.''
</P>
<P>
   Once his coaches got him to stop grappling with his rivals as if
they were defensive tackles, Felton progressed quickly. Unlike most
heavyweights, he's quick and mobile. And he approached the sport
with obsessive intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe lived at that dojo _ literally,'' says Contardo.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Felton was dominating his coaches on the mat.
Once he won his first competition, it was time to cross some oceans
and take on the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing my Mom said when I was doing judo was: How
much are you getting paid?,'' says Felton, who now makes his living
installing car lifts in garages. ``I said, well, I sold my
motorcycle and my truck . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Felton went to Hungary, to England, to Germany, to France, to
Austria, to Poland, to the Czech Republic, to the Netherlands, to
the Scandinavian countries, to any place he could find training and
someone his size to fight. For a while, he was roughly as welcome
as scarlet fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little animosity toward me,'' Felton says. ``There
still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wanted to take on the American football player and
club him upside the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wish I could just get them over here, get a helmet
on them, and go at it,'' Felton says.
</P>
<P>
   With the animosity, though, came fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to a dojo in Japan, they just kept coming,''
Felton says. ``They all wanted to throw me.''
</P>
<P>
   They found out it wasn't all that easy. Though he still can't
count to 10 in Japanese, Felton knows the essential holds and
locks, the grappling and choking techniques and the dozens of
throws, from double outside reaps to ``rice bag'' reversals.
</P>
<P>
   What came more slowly was ``mat sense,'' knowing how to craft a
strategy for every minute of the match, how to maneuver and
manipulate an opponent _ and how to avoid being cat-and-moused
oneself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you screw up in football, you have the rest of the game to
recover,'' Felton says. ``In judo, if you make one mistake, you go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His first world championships in 1997 was a one-day advanced
course that left Felton humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close each time,'' he recalls. ``But I'd make a stupid
mistake each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton had a return ticket last year, but after trashing his
knee in Japan, he decided to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go and not be able to do anything,'' he
figured.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is to make it to Olympus. To do that, Felton
needs to outpoint top rival Martin Boonzaayer, a Motorola engineer
and Mr. America runner-up, by the time the national championships
end in April.
</P>
<P>
   That means winning a medal at next month's Rotterdam Grand Prix
or British Open. That also means three sessions a week at the old
Masonic Hall on County Street, which Nees has transformed into a
roomy dojo.
</P>
<P>
   When Felton was missing for a while around the holidays, he got
a phone call from his sensei. ``Did you forget how to get here?''
Nees needled him. ``If you need a map, it's on my Web site
(www.mikesdojo.inpronet.com).''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese don't take Christmas off. And there'll be no
replacement players in Sydney. That was the whole point of Felton's
taking up judo in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do this so I could say I was a local champion,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Felton sold his wheels and bounced around bargain-basement
Europe and fought malodorous strangers and went passive-aggressive
so he could get to where he is now, a throw or three away from
Sydney. They don't drink mare's milk there. Just lager, mate.

SURF CAMPS: GREAT WAVES ARE WITHIN REACH 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAMOTU ISLAND, Fiji _ A blue hill pushed across the open Pacific
toward the barrier reef. The wave rose with growing promise against
the abrupt bottom and transformed into a steepening wall as it
swept along the edge of the reef pass. Reflections of sunlit coral
ghosted through the clear trough, and the morning wind tore a
crackle of urgent spray from the crest.
</P>
<P>
   Magnificent isn't too strong a word to describe this mighty
force of nature _ at least not for the surfers who know these
moments best.
</P>
<P>
   Wyman Wade of Houston swung his 9-foot board and took three
powerful strokes to launch over the pitching ledge. The 43-year-old
Wade sprang to his feet, flexing in a crouch to absorb the drop.
The crest threw out and over, blasting with an avalanche of white
as the speeding board banked from the bottom and aimed like a spear
for the unbroken shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The surfer climbed and dropped, racing the peeling wave for 200
yards down the reef before pulling out amid a plume of spray into
the safety of the channel. Outside, beyond the dissipating foam
that charted the ride, another perfect blue wave was wrapping down
the reef. Gregg Pratka, in position, began scratching for the
takeoff while fellow Houstonians John Stavinoha and Chris Noon,
paddling out, yelled encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the idea of a group of middle-aged
Americans riding a remote reef break in Fiji was inconceivable.
International surf exploration, still in its infancy, was the turf
of surf guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed on the beach and in the curl. Now surf
resorts _ or ``surf camps,'' although the rough-and-tumble
connotation doesn't always apply _ lure adventure-seeking travelers
to the South Pacific, Mexico, Central America and other spots
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This global quest for the ``perfect wave'' gained steam in the
mid-1960s, when Bruce Brown's ``The Endless Summer'' (a documentary
about two surfers traveling in search of surf) inspired a
generation of wave riders to venture beyond the growing crowds in
California, Hawaii and Florida. The first ``secret spots'' on the
Pacific Coast were drive-to beaches in Mexico, such as Mazatlan and
San Blas. East Coast surfers found Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   During the '70s, the potential for world-class reefs and points
exploded as surfers took to the off-road jungles of Mexico, Central
America, Africa and Indonesia. Guarded word of fabulous breaks
filtered back _ Petacalco in Mexico, La Libertad in El Salvador,
Pavones in Costa Rica, Chicama in Peru, Uluwatu in Bali, Grajagan
in Java, Tavarua in Fiji, Jeffrey's Bay in South Africa. Exotic
blue-and-green images began appearing in surf magazines and films.
</P>
<P>
   Jungle waves tantalized urban surfers mired in the brown rubble
of crowded beach breaks, but these remote destinations were mostly
the domain of hard-core adventurers _ renegades and one-eyed jacks
toting battered single-fin pintails and tattered backpacks, willing
to eat dust and risk revolution for the sight of ``la punta
perfecta'' unreeling off some nameless malarial river mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Many failed in their crusade. A few died. But those who scored
expanded the horizon and changed surfing forever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a vagabond known as the Jackal was holding court on the
Mazatlan seawall. He overlooked Cannon's Point, the glossy
left-breaking wave that had started the wanderlust for thousands of
surfers who saw ``Stoner's Mexican Log,'' Ron Stoner's photo spread
in the November 1966 issue of Surfer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackal was a ne'er-do-well, but he was experienced. He had a
case-hardened tan, and he had seen the beaches and ridden the waves
deep in the ``Centro'' jungles. When mighty Cannon's boomed on a
big south swell, he would take off on the sucking ledge behind the
boil, over the shallow rocks spiked with purple sea urchins. That
day the Jackal stared with knowing eyes, pointed a knuckly finger
and said, ``When you get back to the country club, tell 'em center
court ain't nowhere close.''
</P>
<P>
   As any serious surfer will agree, the Jackal was correct in his
assessment of center court, indeed all courts and courses. But time
has proved him wrong on the country-club mentality.
</P>
<P>
   The country club has come to the surf. Over the past decade, the
expansion of &UR;  &LR; surf camps at tropical destinations has had a
significant impact on surfing.
</P>
<P>
   A typical surf camp or resort near a classic break offers a
full-service package that includes airport pickup, lodging, meals
and transfers by boat or land vehicle to surf spots. Usually a
qualified water patrol remains on site while guests are in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   The cost (excluding air fare) of a week at an upscale surf
resort is about $1,000 _ cheap compared to similar packages at top
ski resorts or fishing lodges.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of having someone deliver a pina colada to your hot tub
or escort you to the surf might be scorned by dedicated off-road
explorers, but the established resorts are booked solid during peak
surf seasons. Some have long waiting lists. They appeal to
professionals and family-oriented surfers, people who lust for
adventure but cannot afford to spend weeks or months trailing off
in quest of ``secret spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Namotu Blue Water Sports Resort is a fine example of an upscale
wave-riding bivouac. It sits alone on Namotu Island, which is part
of the Mamanuca Island chain southwest of Fiji's main island, Viti
Levu. The resort was started in 1996 by a small partnership of
Australians and Hawaiians. The operation books through
California-based WaterWays Surf Adventures (motto: ``Offering
global surf relief for local surf anxiety'') and caters almost
entirely to surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Namotu is tiny, occupying three to five acres, depending on the
tide swing. The little outcrop lies inside the Malolo Barrier Reef,
several miles north of more famous Tavarua Island. The coral reef
catches open-ocean swells generated by storms in the Roaring
Forties south of Australia, and various passes allow the waves to
break with regimented control into deeper channels. The peeling
waves create excellent surfing conditions, especially under the
prevailing light to moderate ``side-off'' trade winds.
</P>
<P>
   The water over the South Seas reefs is clear as alcohol,
sparkling with gaudy corals and glittering fish, and the water
temperature averages about 78 degrees (similar to Hawaii's South
Shore/Waikiki area). Sunny days predominate.

UCONN'S SHEA RALPH IS STRONGER AFTER TWO KNEE SURGERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ The long road back from an anterior cruciate
ligament injury, as any athlete will tell you, is fraught with
physical and mental minefields. One wrong step and _ kaboom! _ you
can be thrown for a giant setback. But the journey back, as
grueling as it can be on the mind, body, and spirit, is extremely
rewarding in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Shea Ralph knows all too well the feelings of exasperation and
exhilaration that such a rehabilitation can evoke.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the University of Connecticut junior forward has
made the descent into that physical hell and ascent to complete
recovery twice. The first time she tore her right ACL was March 15,
1997, in the first NCAA tournament appearance of her dazzling
freshman season. It happened on a fast break with 12:31 left in the
first half of a 103-35 rout of Lehigh in the first round of the
Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing extensive rehabilitation that got her back on
the court that August, Ralph wound up sitting out the 1997-98
season as a medical redshirt when she reinjured the knee in
preseason workouts Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Going through that once is enough to make anyone wince. But
twice in the same year? It would seem a harsh sentence to impose on
any athlete's budding career.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph's resolve to fight back was unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   Her sheer will and determination to overcome her injury and make
herself into a better player than when she arrived at Storrs,
Conn., four years ago as a highly-touted high school All-American
from Fayetteville, N.C., is the main reason the top-ranked and
top-seeded Huskies romped through the first two rounds of the NCAA
East Regional last weekend to clinch their seventh straight Sweet
16 appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Shea's case, her mindset once she came to Connecticut from
where she was in high school, the injury was probably the worst
thing that could've happened to her,'' said UConn coach Geno
Auriemma. ``She was just learning what it was to be part of a
really good team and what she had to do to be a part of that team.
Then the injury happened, and it forced her to become even more
self-directed: `I've got to do this for me. I've got to get back.
I've got to get my game back. I've got to get healthy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So you keep going down that path where it's all about you and
what you're doing, and it kind of set her back a little bit. You
never know how a kid will respond to that. Some kids never come
back, and some kids come back better than they ever were. In her
case, she had to go through it again. The second time? Honestly, if
you would've told me that Shea would never play again at the level
that she was accustomed to playing, I would say that I wouldn't be
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's how far I think she's had to come.''
</P>
<P>
   So which took a greater toll on her? The physical or mental
aspect of her rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither was easy,'' Ralph said. ``The physical was the hardest
_ short term. It was the first thing I had to face. Mentally, I
didn't have to face anything but my rehab every day. The physical
part was harder for me in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental part took longer for me to overcome and I think if
you compare the two, the mental part was way, way harder, because
physically you can only do so much and it's guaranteed to pay off.
Mentally, you have to find the right thing and you don't even know
if it'll pay off or not.''
</P>
<P>
   All throughout her medical redshirt year, Ralph wrestled with
the same fears that most athletes do when rehabbing from a torn
ACL.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Will I be the same athlete? Will I be better after this?
Or worse off?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Ralph knew it would be a long road back to where she left off as
a freshman, when she averaged 11.4 points and 4.5 rebounds off the
bench and was recognized as Big East Rookie of the Year and
National Freshman of the Year by The Sporting News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did (worry) in the beginning. I think everybody
does,'' she said. ``I think it was part of the process that I
needed to go through to learn and to grow from what happened. So
there was a part of me that did worry, and I think that when I was
worrying and concerned about that I wasn't a player. I didn't play
well. I didn't even belong on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I overcame that, and I started to focus my energies
outward instead of inward, it all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't until February of her sophomore season, when she
returned to the lineup after missing four games with a sprained
medial collateral ligament and dropped 36 points on Boston College
in her first collegiate start. Ralph went on to improve her scoring
average to 16.8 ppg after starting 11 of 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about two or three weeks after I started playing in
January that I put it all behind me and began to play,'' she said.
``Last year, there were relapses and whatnot, but I still had a lot
of learning to do because I wasn't very experienced and my role had
changed, and I had to get accustomed to it and I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I made some decisions over the summer in what I wanted to
do and what I wanted to be for this program and for my teammates.
It's just really worked out for me and I'm happy.''
</P>

   That's because she is finally reaping the rewards of all her
hard work. She earned Big East Player of the Year honors after
starting all 31 regular-season games and leading the Huskies in
scoring (14.5 ppg). She recently was named to the Associated Press
All-America team along with UConn teammate Svetlana Abrosimova.

   ``As long as the journey has been physically to get her knee
back, I think mentally the jump has been even further,'' Auriemma
said. ``It's easy to go in the weight room and lift weights and
rehab and do all that. That's easy. To become better mentally and
to understand what the game is all about, that's hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``For her to have made that jump and not lost any aggression in
both the mental and physical part of her game is something really
special.''

BLEDSOE READY TO THROW CONTRACT OVER TO HELP PATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe says he's not looking to break
the bank and is willing to restructure his contract to help make
the Patriots a better team.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe, who took part in the first official day of strength
and conditioning workouts under new specialty coach Mike Woicik,
may be waiting for some time on that.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations began last year, but Patriots CEO Andy Wasynczuk
said Monday that no proposals from the Bledsoe side would benefit
the financial future of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bledsoe's cap numbers are so high _ $8.66 million this
season and $9.3 million next season _ the Patriots are somewhat
handcuffed on signing free agents. Wasynczuk has restructured other
players' contracts _ pushing more payments into the future _ but he
fears doing that with a contract as large as Bledsoe's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at restructuring, there's a certain amount you
do that is kind of affordable for your future,'' said Wasynczuk.
``It doesn't matter if you do it with your quarterback as long as
you can do it with a number of players. If you do it with everyone,
you're in San Francisco's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who has the most service time among current Patriots
(seven years), said, ``It's something we've talked about it and
there have been discussions. My cap number is high and it would
help the team if there were a renegotiation. I'm not going to hold
the team hostage for the very last dollar. The Patriots have been
very good to me and I know they will continue to be. At some point,
there needs to be something done so we can remain competitive in
the free agent market and re-sign our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't it been done?
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stadium, the coaching change, there have been things
going on,'' said Bledsoe. ``It's not something I'm concerned about.
At some point it needs to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Patriots are holding off because they're
uncertain about their commitment to Bledsoe after a subpar season,
Wasynczuk said, ``The flip side is that, from our point of view,
that might be the best time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said, ``When and if it gets done, it opens up a lot of
room for us. I'm open to it and I'm hoping it happens very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But apparently it won't. There may be more conversations on the
topic at the owners' meetings in Palm Beach, Fla., next week, if
Wasynczuk runs into Bledsoe's agent, Leigh Steinberg. Otherwise,
the Patriots are concentrating on other issues, such as trying to
get Tedy Bruschi and Bruce Armstrong re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   At 27 years old, and in the middle of a seven-year, $42 million
deal, Bledsoe can't believe he's the elder statesman on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here longer than the owner, longer than the coaching
staff (except for Dante Scarnecchia),'' he said. ``Only the
equipment guy and the two trainers have been here longer. I think
of myself as a kid, yet I have the longest tenure in the
organization. Time is short in this league. The first seven years
have gone by pretty quickly and I know that the rest of it is going
to go by quickly. I have to approach this year like it's my only
opportunity to make it to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But first he must put last season behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the midway point, we felt we had something going,'' said
Bledsoe. ``To have it turn so dramatically, it was tough to deal
with. For me, it's easier to come back and easier to focus on
things I need to focus on. I feel everything outside of football is
about as good as I can make it. When I come here and focus on
football, I can do that clearly. I think I have a better
understanding of what I need to do to prepare for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he called 1999 ``the most disappointing season of my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bledsoe, ``Teams started challenging us and gave us press
coverage down the field and we didn't react very favorably. We just
didn't make plays the second half and we turned it over. You don't
ever forget about it. You file it away as experience and you learn
from the bad plays. As far as the emotional part, yeah, I'm over
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback will soon sit down with new coach Bill Belichick
to determine what it was that it made it so difficult for him to
play the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pick his brain on what he felt were my strengths and
weaknesses when he was playing me,'' said Bledsoe. ``I'm sure he'll
share those things with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not reviewed his film from last season, but he
didn't think he had mechanical problems. He will be asked to
improve his footwork and mobility, but he is what he is _ one of
the last classic dropback passers in the NFL. It's an issue he
thinks about often, especially with the trend shifting toward
mobile quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can still get the job done,'' he said. ``I know I can
take this team to a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe will miss Ben Coates and, if he is not re-signed,
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on a short list of the best players who have ever
played for the Patriots,'' said Bledsoe. ``To see those guys depart
is very hard to take. The door is still open for Bruce and I hope
to do everything in my power to get him back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the offseason personnel losses _ and few additions _ he
still thinks the Patriots are a team to be reckoned with. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're naive, and that's what we do,'' said Bledsoe. ``If I had
to take the field with you guys, I'd be optimistic about it. It
might be unrealistic, but I'm going to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also know we have lost some guys. I know about the
character of this team, and we have enough talent that if we make
enough plays we can win. I believe that we can be very competitive
and with a couple of additions we can do some things.''
</P>

NAMOTU ISLAND, Fiji: Sunny days predominate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Namotu is ringed by three potentially world-class surf breaks _
Namotu Lefts, Swimming Pools and Wilkes. All can be observed from
the camp. Under favorable weather and swell conditions, Namotu is a
compact Fantasy Island, and the resort's package tour puts a week
within reach of wave-starved surfers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-hour nonstop Air Pacific flight from Los Angeles to
Nadi on Viti Levu, the 16-man Texas contingent was met at dawn by
air-conditioned tour buses and transported to a shallow backwater
bay about an hour away for boat transfers to Namotu.
</P>
<P>
   Long, open, outboard-powered skiffs staffed by surf camps at
Namotu and Tavarua were well-suited for loading surfboard bags and
luggage. The run to the barrier reef took about 45 minutes.
Recurring lines of white beyond the growing specks of land assured
that the surf was up.
</P>
<P>
   Landing at Namotu International Dock and Wharf (otherwise known
as the leeward beach), the group was met by waving and singing
staff members. Necklaces of coral and shell were draped over each
arriving neck, and drinks were shuttled from the decked bar that
overlooks the barrier reef and the beautiful Namotu Lefts.
</P>
<P>
   The resort, managed by Australians Scotty and Mandy O'Connor,
can lodge groups of 16-20. Two bunkhouses are complemented by
several two- to four-bed thatched bungalows, or ``bures,'' with
private bathrooms and balconies. No air conditioning is available,
but most days it is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are served with South Seas flair and flare (as in flaming
torches) amid palm fronds and tapa cloth on the deck next to the
swimming pool and hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, my wife would really like `roughing it' here,'' was the
refrain during Scotty O'Connor's orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The skiffs are used to transport surfers to the breaks and held
ready for unlimited transfers, a solid program that allows
leisurely sessions to suit individual schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The mood around the camp and kitchen was upbeat, highlighted by
a ``magiti,'' or feast. The feast included platters of grilled
fish, roasted pig and the kava-drinking ritual. To get off on the
right foot (a bare one, naturally), all guests are expected to
partake.
</P>
<P>
   Kava is a muddy, slightly narcotic liquid pounded from the root
of the pepper plant. It is served from a ``tanoa,'' a large wooden
bowl. The celebrants, male and female, wear wrap-around skirts
called ``sulus'' and sit in a circle on woven mats as the kava is
served in a ``bilo,'' a cup made from half a coconut shell.
</P>
<P>
   The proper technique requires clapping once, then taking the
full cup in both hands and bowing slightly to the server. The drink
is quaffed in one bold, mouth-numbing swallow; then you hand the
empty vessel to the server and clap three times.
</P>
<P>
   You do not want to trip over your trailing vestments and drop
the cup. The ceremony is an ancient custom, and the only thing
worse than getting drilled on a double-overhead Fijian wave is
choking on a kava cup and spewing the host.
</P>
<P>
   All this might sound contrived, but on a small South Seas
island, under the flicker of torches, against the concussion of the
black reef, with your face greasy and your lips numb, in the
company of proven comrades, it works pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   Not that surf resorts are without problems and controversies.
Regardless of venue, each tide is different, and a flat spell or a
contrary wind might wipe out several days, even an entire week _ a
soul-deadening prospect for the short-term Crusoe on a package
trip.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, the surf might be out of control,
dangerous for a casual participant. Surf camps are near serious
breaks, with the kind of waves that dedicated surfers are willing
to spend time and money to ride. It's easy to get in over your head
at a world-class spot, especially for the swelling ranks of the
sport's ``gray wave.'' Older surfers may have the resources, but
the perfect wave can prove too much for the imperfect wave rider.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged affluence might buy a gunned custom Fry pintail
surfboard, a first-class Air Pacific upgrade and a week at Namotu
Blue Water Sports Resort, but you are alone and stripped of all
pretense in the lineup to ride the waves. One of the truths of
surfing is that there are no timeouts and no penalty strokes, and
no gold card can bail you out if things start going horribly wrong
about midway down the face of a freight-train wave.
</P>
<P>
   Surf camps usually require waivers or disclaimers in case a
guest is jackhammered into the reef or speared by a board or
carried under in a rip. Reasonable levels of fitness and expertise
are expected; without them, you should stay home or remain a
noncombatant on the big days.
</P>
<P>
   One appealing aspect for graybeards is that the most consistent
spot here, Namotu Lefts, has a deeper reef under the surfing area.
This cushion provides a ``softer'' wave with more sloping face than
the terrifying Cloudbreak of nearby Tavarua. Namotu certainly is a
serious wave in the double-overhead class, but normally it is not
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Spending a week on a small island rimmed by winding reef breaks
allows many opportunities for personal success and failure.
Highlights might include a huge, high-speed cutback on a bowling
peak at Namotu Lefts or an immaculate 100-yard trim on an overhead
right at Swimming Pools with the sun-sparkled curl pitching above
straining arms and streaming board during the entire run.
</P>
<P>
   Another pure moment might be a crushing wipeout _ too deep, too
steep, nowhere to go but down, tumbling across the shelving reef
and emerging bleeding and frightened, gasping and choking, to face
another pummel of whitewater and the realization that the clean
line of surfing can take you to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing aspect of surfing in Fiji involves laws that
allow surf camps to control specific breaks _ a notion that is
offensive to some surfers. (The dusty Jackal would be appalled.)
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, the ocean beyond the tideline belongs to the
public; surfers have the right to ride waves near a camp without
being hassled or abused.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Fiji is unusual because the tribes of the
Mamanuca Islands have for generations owned fishing rights on reefs
rimming the islands. The case has been made that waves, like fish,
are associated with particular reef formations, so the inhabitants
of Namotu and Tavarua regulate access to some surf spots.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, full-service resorts are a positive step,
placing adventure travel and great surf within reliable reach of
thousands of surfers each year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the country-club concept is working. And the perfect
wave is only a phone call away.

VAUGHN AT PEACE WITH HIS DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Something has changed with Mo Vaughn. Call it a
new attitude. Say that, after eight-plus seasons in baseball, he
has grown up and now fully understands the circumstances
surrounding his departure from the Red Sox after the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   He is no longer reticent to talk about it. Feeling like a kid
again, Vaughn says he can't wait to begin his second season with
the Anaheim Angels, who shelled out $80 million to sign him. During
negotiations with the Red Sox, Vaughn often claimed his decision
wasn't about money. But he never has said what the other
considerations were. In a recent interview, he came close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had put in seven years,'' said Vaughn. ``I knew I wasn't
going to do any better in Boston. I wasn't going to hit any higher.
I couldn't hit any more home runs. I couldn't drive in more runs.
The only place that I could go was down _ and I knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to play there. Don't get me wrong. I'm not wishing
anyone bad luck just because they put on a Red Sox uniform. But it
needs to be said it is hard to play there. So when my contract was
up, I knew it was time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A slimmer and more mature Vaughn says he is ready for a second
season with the Angels. He is confident that he can improve on his
1999 season, when he hit just .281 with 33 home runs and 108 RBIs.
The ankle sprain he incurred on Opening Day and cost him 30 games
has healed, and he will be ready to face his old team come April 7
in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, 32, confessed it took him almost a year and a half to
put his feelings into focus. But now that he has, he should be a
better person and player. He has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy now,'' he said. ``Happy with a new regime, new
coaches and a new manager. My family is happy and that's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   When he played for the Red Sox, Vaughn was a superstar of
enormous dimensions who had few private moments around here. But
after he signed with Anaheim, he still spent part of the offseason
in New England, and it was a wakeup call not being part of the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It bothered him that news of his charitable work slipped out of
sight. He noticed that Red Sox fans who had supported him in his
dispute with Dan Duquette began to question his professionalism.
That hurt. Even when he got media coverage, things like the Foxy
Lady and negative off-field incidents usually were mentioned. That
is just wrong, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have lived somewhere else and not lived in New
England year round,'' said Vaughn. ``But I still have ties with the
foundation. I enjoy working and being with those kids. I have a
place in California now. Out here, nobody bothers you.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness for Mo Vaughn has not come easy. The ankle injury
pretty much destroyed any chance he had of being ``The Savior'' in
Anaheim in 1999. The team, which some picked to win the American
League West or at least earn a wild-card berth because of Vaughn,
finished last in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you saw the real Mo last year,'' said Gary
DiSarcina, the veteran Angels shortstop from Billerica, Mass. ``He
came into a whole new situation and got hurt right away. He wasn't
producing the way he thought he should. He was hands off and pretty
stiff. He was mostly looking in from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is very different. He's very vocal and having fun.
Guys feed off that. When they see Mo having fun, it kind of relaxes
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no more second-guessing himself about leaving
Boston, Vaughn insists. The decision was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it first in 1998 when I walked off the field after I
hit a double off the wall in a playoff game,'' said Vaughn. ``The
more I thought about it, the more I got tired of people trying to
figure out what type of person I was or what I was doing off the
field. I realized I might have a real problem if I didn't continue
to go out and hit .320 and 40 bombs a year and drive in 140-plus
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my performance had deteriorated, I could understand. But I
was already doing the best I could. The only place I knew I could
go was down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox knew I played for the love of the game. But in
Boston they didn't evaluate me that way. They were evaluating me on
other things. After I signed with Anaheim, I knew I would never be
able to adequately explain any situations or my contract. I would
never be able to explain this or that. I would always wind up being
looked at in a negative light, and I didn't feel I deserved that.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast lifestyle is a lot better than he thought it
would be. He lives in Newport, Calif., near his parents. He says he
feels as comfortable there as he does in Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living there is really different than back East,'' said
Vaughn. ``Here there are so many more athletes. I hang out with
Shaq when I'm in LA. I hang with other guys like Charles Barkley .
. . a lot of guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been exposed to several new industries _ music and
movies. But I know who I am. I'm a baseball player. I'm not going
to be a rapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this realm, you can just be regular. You don't have
anything to hide or worry about because not everybody has their
eyes focused on you. Your're not an icon or a superstar. You're
just like they are. It's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox reach the playoffs, said Vaughn, ``Don't be
surprised to find the Angels waiting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   An overhaul of the staff _ from manager Terry Collins down
through the scouts _ has Vaughn excited about the team's chances.
He already has become close with new manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like two peas in a pod,'' said Vaughn. ``In Mike we have a guy
who understands what it takes to win. You look around and you have
a lot of talent. We could use some pitching, without a doubt. The
main thing is that we've got the right approach now. Nobody is
picking us. So we'll just sneak up on everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all these guys yet. But I must have changed my
attitude and approach a whole lot _ to the point they ask me, `Why
weren't you like that last year?' ''

WHERE DID THE BIG BANG HAPPEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Assuming that the Big Bang theory is correct, where in the
Universe did it occur? Specifically, how many light years was it
from the present milky way galaxy _ our Earth in particular. Are we
on an outer edge of the universe? What could be beyond the known
universe?
</P>
<P>
   B.L., Norfolk, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The tricky thing about the expansion of the universe is that
it's supposed to be an expansion of space itself, rather than an
expansion into a pre-existing space. Probably the best way to
visualize what's going on is by analogy and the best analogy of the
expansion of our three-dimensional universe is the two-dimensional
surface of a balloon as it gets inflated. Dots drawn on the balloon
all move away from each other and there is no center on the surface
_ every point moves away from every other. The total area of the
surface is finite, but there are no walls or edges.
</P>
<P>
   For our universe, the idea is pretty much the same. Everything
moves away from everything else and there is no center. The total
volume of the universe is finite, but there are no walls or edges.
Hard to understand? You bet. Einstein tried to fudge his equation
of gravity in order to describe a static universe with no
expansion. He thus missed predicting the expanding universe and
later called it the biggest scientific blunder of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now what's beyond the universe? Well, by definition, the
universe is everything. In the balloon analogy, the inside of the
balloon is just something to help us imagine the expansion, but not
a part of the two-dimensional world of dots on the surface. In the
same way (again, it's tricky), our universe is supposed to be all
there is.

RESEARCH TO PLUMB EFFECT OF BEHAVIOR DRUGS ON CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration vows to tackle a question that's been
on the minds of physicians for a while: is America overmedicating
its children with psychiatric drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by an alarming increase in the use of such drugs as
Ritalin and Prozac among preschoolers and other youngsters, First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says $5 million will be spent at the
National Institute of Mental Health to study the impact of
psychiatric drugs on children younger than 7 years old. In
addition, the US Food and Drug Administration will start a process
to improve the labeling of some of these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association found a steep rise in the number of children receiving
prescriptions for psychiatric drugs, such as a 200 percent increase
of the number of pre-schoolers on antidepressants between 1991 and
1995. And the number of children younger than 5 taking clonidine,
used for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or those
exhibiting disruptive behavior, increased 28-fold.
</P>
<P>
   While Boston-area psychiatrists were encouraged by the extra
spending on more studies, some cautioned not to bash psychiatrists
for overmedicating young children and said that when used properly,
the drugs help.
</P>
<P>
   While there are instances when mistakes are made, ``many
children are dramatically helped by treatment with medications not
technically approved or labeled in their age group,'' said Dr.
Joseph Gold, who is the clinical director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not just Ritalin. It's almost across the board in child
psychiatry,'' said Gold. ``The urgency of providing relief for an
individual child can be great, for the child and the family, and
can't wait years for it to be studied,'' said Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Gold said that part of the difficulty of diagnosis of a
psychiatric disease, such as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder is that there are other kinds of problems that cause
children to have problems sitting still or to concentrate, such as
environmental exposure to lead, stressful household situations and
in most extreme case, response to abuse. Severe marital stress or
financial stress in the household can affect the child, and other
psychiatric problems can overlap or mimic ADHD, such as severe
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key questions in the evaluation is has the child
always had difficulty sitting still, sustaining attention to a
task, or is this something new,'' said Gold, who added that often
behavioral and other educational help is tried first before
approaching medication.
</P>
<P>
   But Joni Ketter, of the American Federation of Teachers, said
that many school nurses have told her that they are surprised at
the large number of children taking the medications. Ketter said
she spoke to one elementary school nurse from Philadelphia who
reported administering Ritalin to 44 students each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers and nurses are concerned about the use of the
drugs,'' said Ketter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Hallowell, a child psychiatrist, said the funding
dedicated to looking at young children is good. ``We know a lot
more about the brain in the last 10 years and have developed
wonderful new medications, but the bad news is that there's not
been nearly enough funding and research in children,'' said
Hallowell. ``One of the big problems is that we don't have data.''
</P>
<P>
   While psychiatrists said that there are cases of overmedication
and undermedication, part of the problem is that psychiatric
disorders are diagnosed clinically, which means that decisions are
based on the history of clinical signs and symptoms. No simple
diagnostic blood test tells doctors or parents that their children
may have a serious psychiatric disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is insurance, and its tendency to pay for
medications instead of therapy or time spent with a patient. ``If
someone is expected to see more patients then the tendency is to
give medications, hoping that it will provide a quick answer,
instead of giving something comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Any physician can prescribe psychiatric drugs, not just
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of very effective treatment regimens for
childhood problems that do not involve medications that insurance
won't pay for,'' said Hallowell.

`CARAVAN' HAS ROOM TO RIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One beneficial effect of an Academy Award nomination is the
``Oscar bounce,'' the frequent jump in audience interest that this
year blessed ``American Beauty'' and ``The Cider House Rules''
following their respective wads of nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But another Oscar nominee, ``Caravan,'' is hoping for its own
sort of bounce with a different audience: a film distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Where the high-profile U.S. releases are merely counting the
extra millions rolling in from newly appreciative fans, the makers
of ``Caravan'' are trying to bring their film _ shot in one of the
world's most remote, and stunning, regions _ to American
theater-goers.
</P>
<P>
   Though 3 million people have already seen the film in France,
and it has done well in the few other countries where it has a
distribution deal, it somehow managed to get an Oscar nomination
with no U.S. theatrical outlet, one of only two such films this
year, according to its makers.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Frenchman Eric Valli, ``Caravan'' is the official
best foreign language film nominee of Nepal, where it was shot with
largely non-professional actors, based on the nearly two decades
Valli spent in the Himalayan highlands as a still photographer and
documentary maker.
</P>
<P>
   Valli uses his photographer's eye to capture image after
overwhelming image of the hard-scrabble village life in Dolpo, in
northwest Nepal. The film revolves around the periodic caravans
that set out on foot from the village for the 900-mile trip to more
fertile areas where they trade salt for grain.
</P>
<P>
   An old chief, Tinle, blames his son's death during a caravan on
Karma, his son's assistant and best friend. He fights Karma's
naming by village elders as the man to lead the next caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Karma in turn defies village traditions by starting the caravan
before the officially ordained day, taking most of the village's
yaks and young men in an effort to beat the looming winter storms.
</P>
<P>
   Tinle organizes a second caravan with some of the village's old
men, his daughter-in-law, grandson and second son, who is a monk,
and drives them hard to catch up. How the chiefs _ old, new and yet
to come _ deal with the arduous trip forms much of the film.
</P>
<P>
   The hard journey reflects the hard process of making the film
itself, Valli said. Just to get to Dolpo requires walking a crew
and equipment over three mountain ``passes'' that each are more
than 17,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest inhabited part of the world,'' said Valli,
who lived there for two years. ``You cannot helicopter in, because
you would blow your brain out from the altitude. You would die of
edema. It's like some parts of America 200 years ago. It's a rough
life. We could compare Tinle to 'The Last of the Mohicans.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most astonishing shots are taken along a narrow
trail cut into a sheer rock face above a mountain lake. The scene
mirrors an experience Valli had a dozen years ago with a real
caravan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a documentary. But it's very authentic,'' Valli
said. ``There are no special effects, other than the stars (in a
twilight scene) and the yak falling in (on the lake trail).
Otherwise, we're shooting what is very similar to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That included five weeks of shooting the film's climactic scenes
in snowstorms over one of the passes. For all those physical
challenges, Valli said his biggest challenge was getting his
17-member crew to interact comfortably with the villagers who
played all the film's roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Tinle since 1983,'' Valli said. ``We've been
roaming together for many, many years. But I knew if I couldn't
create the relationship that I had with the crew and my friends in
Dolpo, I couldn't bring back the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Valli said he was overwhelmed by the film's Oscar nomination,
though he had previously received one for a short documentary
called ``Shadow Hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valli said he sees the current film as a fitting testament
to a way of life that he believes will soon disappear under the
onslaught of tourism and pressures of neighboring China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the only testimony about what was this part of this
world,'' Valli said. ``Nobody else is going to shoot a movie up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only he can get someone to watch it in the United
States.

   A Bandwidth Boom: Soon, a fiber-optic thread will be able to
convey 2,000 waves of light at once, up from eight or 16 waves last
year. This means that in a single second, a fiber-optic cable (with
864 individual threads) will carry the same amount of traffic that
crossed the Internet in a whole month two or three years ago. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Optics: New laser technology will allow companies to
transmit huge volumes of data without wires. Gilder loves a young
company called TeraBeam of Seattle, whose ``wireless optics'' could
conquer the ``last mile'' _ the problem of making high-speed
connections to the millions of US homes and businesses. A wireless
connection would be far cheaper than laying cables to all of those
buildings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Focus on Storage: As companies create new products that use
vast amounts of data, it becomes important to find ways to store
data close to the people likeliest to use it. Akamai, Digital
Island, Xcelera, and others are working on the problem.

<P>
   MBARE, Zimbabwe _ In a wooden shed behind one of the tiny
cinderblock houses that line this district's narrow dirt roads,
12-year-old Nomsa Mwale struggles with her new role as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nomsa's father died of AIDS in 1998. Six months ago, her mother
followed him, leaving the five children to make their way in a
world that offers little comfort and less hope.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, Nomsa stares vacantly away from the people who
have come to see her. She is thin and has a sweet, doe-like face.
With a tiny, wispy voice, she answers the questions about her
family's circumstance, but she does not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The first-born girl, it has fallen to her to care for older
brother Sibongile, 15, and the three younger children: Shonia, 10;
Garikai, 9; and Betina, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their life is a frenzy of survival guided by little more than
the advice given by their mother as she prepared her children for
their journey without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to tell the boys not to go to people's houses
because if something is missing, they will blame them,'' Nomsa
says. ``She said, 'You need to feed the others but also you must
learn to take care of yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was the best advice, because Nomsa has almost no one but
herself.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic in Africa is an orphan-making machine,
striking down millions of men and women in their prime
child-rearing years. A recent United Nations report estimates that
Africa is home to more than 9 million children who have lost their
parents to AIDS. If nothing changes, this number is expected to
triple over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, there are as many as 800,000 AIDS orphans. In one
rural school, 24 percent of its 946 students have lost their
parents to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As international aid groups stagger under the weight of their
task and complain bitterly over the of the lack of funding from the
West _ most notably, the United States _ the machine shows no sign
of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, about 400 Zimbabweans die from AIDS-related illnesses,
most of them likely to have children. It is the same story across
Africa, where new statistics show that 23.3 million people are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In 1998, 2.2 million
Africans died from AIDS-related illnesses; while 200,000 died in
the continent's many wars.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of Zimbabwe's 11 million to 13 million
residents are HIV-positive, the hihest AIDS rate in Africa. In
this one country, roughly half the size of Texas, twice as many
people are infected with the AIDS virus than in all of North
America. An estimated 3,000 more are infected each week.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something unexpected happens, virtually all will die.
AIDS already permeates most lives here. Stories of stricken
relatives are as common as comments on the weather. There is a
never-ending parade of funerals. Mortuaries in the major cities _
Harare and Bulawayo _ remain open 24 hours a day to handle the boom
of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic has decimated the country's most productive layer
of society _ the 18- to 40-year-olds who do the work, pay the taxes
and raise the children.
</P>
<P>
   They leave behind legions like Nomsa with little prospect of the
most basic emotional, physical or material necessities.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-by-8-foot shack occupied by Nomsa and her siblings is
surrounded by rusting lean-tos inhabited by tough-looking older
men. The children share a foul-smelling toilet and shower with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   When the children have food, usually a little something provided
by local charities, they cook on a one-burner stove. From time to
time the food is stolen by the lodgers, who pay Nomsa's uncle to
sleep in the hovels that surround the shed.
</P>
<P>
   The structures are behind a slovenly house owned by Nomsa's long
dead grandparents. The children have no legal rights to the
property, which is owned by their uncle. They have no birth
certificates to prove who they are.
</P>
<P>
   The children do laundry once a month when they have soap. The
girls sleep on the one bed inside the shed. The boys sleep on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   None go to school. They can't afford the equivalent of US$6 to
US$10 in fees each per term much less the US$10 it costs each for
uniforms and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And her extended family?
</P>
<P>
   Their uncle wants to evict them. Nomsa has a legal paper from
him demanding that they vacate the property. He has told them he
wants their space so that he can take in a few more paying lodgers.
He complains to the children bitterly about the money they're
costing him by using up his real estate. He has never been violent,
but the children are terrified of him.
</P>
<P>
   Already numbed by her losses, Nomsa cannot seem to get her mind
around this new threat.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where she will go, she has no answer. A tear streams
down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Local charities are struggling with the uncle trying to see if
they don't need to just pay him off to leave the children alone.
The uncle has shown little inclination to be compassionate with his
nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can we do?'' asks Kizito Makore, a volunteer with the
Mashambanzou Charity, noticeably depressed after visiting children.
``They need so much and we have so little to give.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case of Nomsa and her siblings is a bad one, it is
hardly unique.
</P>
<P>
   Before the AIDS epidemic, only 2 percent of African children
were orphaned. The rate now is as high as 11 percent, and UNICEF
expects it to reach 35 percent in Zimbabwe within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those with HIV become infected before the age of 25 and
die while their children are too young to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of orphans comes at a time when extreme poverty has
reduced to near nothing an already feeble social welfare system in
this largely agrarian society. About 63 percent of the people in
Zimbabwe are classified as poor. The unemployment rate is more than
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When AIDS strikes parents, incomes dry up. The family slips
deeper into poverty as it devotes its meager resources to caring
for sick loved ones and eventually transporting a body home and
funeral. In the rural areas, it can cost the equivalent of two
years income to bury a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has shattered the traditional system of extended
families, as witnessed with Nomsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now a fallacy that the African family is there to cushion
the impact on orphans,'' said Marvellous(CQ) Mhloyi, the chair of
population studies at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening economic conditions have pushed relatives to be
indifferent, even callous. ``Human beings are selfish,'' Mhloyi
says. ``Under difficult economic times, that degree of selfishness
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, an uncle or other relative would take control
of the parents' assets but would also assume responsibility for the
well-being of the children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now if the parents die, then the uncle will try to take
the house and other property and depend on others to absorb the
orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   New studies show that AIDS orphans are more likely to be
malnourished than other children. When they go to foster families,
they tend to shoulder heavier workloads than other children already
in the families. They are less likely to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many AIDS orphans, their numbers almost certainly
will rise dramatically. More children live with parents who are
HIV-positive than the number who have already become orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Ngoni Guba, the orphan coordinator for Midland AIDS Service
Organization in Gweru, said the future for these children is grim.
Her organization cares for more than 720 AIDS orphans in central
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are out of school and have no skills training to
allow them to find something to do,'' she says. ``For the boys, you
can foresee delinquency and early manhood. Girls will get married
early _ maybe 15 _ and then what?''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are the most vulnerable. Teenage girls in Africa are eight
times more likely to have AIDS than boys in the same age group.
Most girls get it from older men, ``Sugar Daddies'' who trade sex
for a little money, protection or food.
</P>
<P>
   Many older HIV-infected men will pressure young girls because of
the widely accepted myth in Africa that says a man can be cleansed
of the AIDS virus by having sex with a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a desperate struggle to care for their brothers and
sisters, many teen-age girls turn to prostitution, aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is also making more and more elderly people
parents again, forcing many to consume their already modest savings
on school fees and the other expenses they had assumed were behind
them. Others must resort to backbreaking manual labor to produce
enough food to feed the additional mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these grandparents are at the stage in life when they
need someone to look after them and then suddenly that are forced
to begin again looking after children,'' said Felicity Hatendi,
UNICEF's external relations officer in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   On a disused golf course outside Harare, Lina Smoke sits on the
hard sandy earth in the shade of a peach tree. Not far away are the
two rusting shacks she's called home for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke, who at 88 seems all bone and callous, smiles sweetly at
Terrence, her 4-year-old grandson who now knows her as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence squats beside her, sucking ravenously on the peal of an
orange, a rare treat. Black ants gather under him, attracted by the
drops of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Terrence and his three siblings, Kenneth, 7;
Sharon, 8; and Rovesai, 10, came to their ``ambuya'' _ the local
word for ``granny'' _ after their mother died of AIDS. Their father
was already dead from an AIDS-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   After their mother died, social workers found their ambuya and
delivered the children to her. Smoke says this was the last time
the government gave her anything.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband used to caddy at the gold course, which has been
reclaimed by native weeds, bushes and trees. He built the shacks
himself two decades ago, and they lived together there until he
died five or six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To feed the children, she works the hard dry land to grow corn
and a green leafy vegetable around the shacks. The children, she
laughs, are too young to help her much with the tilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel too tired, I'm so old,'' she says, sitting in
the wilting afternoon heat. ``I feel I'm going to die any time,
even in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what of the children? She looks at Terrence. ``Put them in
a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem today is water. There is none at her home. A
neighbor who used to share now refuses the ambuya and children even
a drop. Another neighbor agreed to supply water but for 100
Zimbabwean dollars a month (a little more than US$2), a shockingly
high price. ``At the moment, I have nothing, so there is no water _
except from the rain,'' she says, clasping her tired, leathery
hands together tightly.
</P>
<P>
   She has another problem. The local government, which owns the
land she occupies, wants to sell off the old golf course and has
told her and the children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So close to the end of her life, she cannot imagine living
elsewhere and indeed knows nowhere to go. ``Soon, I will be gone
and they can just take it all,'' she says. ``I hope they can
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the AIDS orphans end up under the care of their
grandmothers. As little support and assistance as there is for AIDS
orphans, there is less for the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Vlembeu, Zimbabwe's deputy director for social welfare,
said her country's resources are simply too limited to reach AIDS
orphans. In her office in central Harare, she compares the scale of
disaster to Zimbabwe's 1980 war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to deal with children who would be brought to us by
Army officers and others, but now we have to go out and find
them,'' she said. Her department has only one caseworker in each of
57 rural districts. Many don't have cars. ``Some areas are very
weak, and children are suffering because of it,'' she says. ``We
have inadequate resources, but even the meager resources we have,
people cannot access them.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there are efforts to fill this enormous void.
</P>
<P>
   In a small remote valley near the northeastern village of
Mutoko, Jean Cornneck tries to provide orphans something
approximating a home. Cornneck _ called Momma Jean by everyone at
the Mother of Peace home _ says the site was selected by divine
provenance six years ago. She says that clues supplied from God via
a woman in South Africa led the home's founders to this site near
an old leper colony.
</P>
<P>
   On instructions from above, the home accepts no government
support and tries to make itself self-sufficient by farming. ``The
Lord told us to help those infected and affected by AIDS,'' says, a
gentle but forceful woman with a round face and short, snowy hair.
``And that's exactly what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she and volunteers have built a half-dozen cottages.
Each has two rooms for sleeping quarters for children, with as many
as 15 in each Spartan room. Each cottage has a kitchen and small
quarters for a woman, who acts as caretaker but is rewarded with
the title ``momma'' by her charges. Mother of Peace is home to 80
children, 35 of whom are under the age of six.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits. Mother of Peace is at capacity but more
children continue arriving. On once recent day, Momma Jean was
handed a tiny baby, upon whom she immediately began to shower
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Both the baby's parents had died of AIDS and the child's
relatives no longer can care for it. The baby can stay until he is
old enough to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the children at the home have all the signs of AIDS,
many show symptoms of other diseases such as tuberculosis, which is
enjoying a renaissance along with the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of all children under 15 are infected with HIV,
often it came with their mother's milk. In them, the virus lives on
as a morbid connection to mothers and a sad omen of their futures.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In the central Zimbabwean village of Mucheke, Tinashe Cami has
known for some time that he's not healthy. He's on the verge of 16,
yet he is so small and frail that he could easily be mistaken for
10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Children at school have teased him about AIDS because he is so
thin and often is wracked by a cough. A recent test shows he's
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   He lost both his mother and the woman he came to regard as an
aunt to AIDS. He's lucky because a local group pays for his school
fees and uniform. His aunt's sister allows him to remain in the
house, where he has lived the nine years since his mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   He's a good student, even promising at geography and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a soldier and a teacher,'' he says, sitting on
the sofa decorated by his late aunt with a fabric adorned with
Valentine hearts. He likes the idea of being a soldier because he
views the army as a force deployed to help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to teach because he loves children. Even talking about
this ambition causes a smile to break across his face. Despite his
love of children, he has no plans to have any _ in part because of
his illness, but also because he judges the world a poor place for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going this century, it's very hard to think
of having a family.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks of his mother often. ``I remember her face, it was
round and sweet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MBARE, Zimbabwe _ In a wooden shed behind one of the tiny
cinderblock houses that line this district's narrow dirt roads,
12-year-old Nomsa Mwale struggles with her new role as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nomsa's father died of AIDS in 1998. Six months ago, her mother
followed him, leaving the five children to make their way in a
world that offers little comfort and less hope.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, Nomsa stares vacantly away from the people who
have come to see her. She is thin and has a sweet, doe-like face.
With a tiny, wispy voice, she answers the questions about her
family's circumstance, but she does not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The first-born girl, it has fallen to her to care for older
brother Sibongile, 15, and the three younger children: Shonia, 10;
Garikai, 9; and Betina, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their life is a frenzy of survival guided by little more than
the advice given by their mother as she prepared her children for
their journey without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to tell the boys not to go to people's houses
because if something is missing, they will blame them,'' Nomsa
says. ``She said, 'You need to feed the others but also you must
learn to take care of yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was the best advice, because Nomsa has almost no one but
herself.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic in Africa is an orphan-making machine,
striking down millions of men and women in their prime
child-rearing years. A recent United Nations report estimates that
Africa is home to more than 9 million children who have lost their
parents to AIDS. If nothing changes, this number is expected to
triple over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, there are as many as 800,000 AIDS orphans. In one
rural school, 24 percent of its 946 students have lost their
parents to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As international aid groups stagger under the weight of their
task and complain bitterly over the of the lack of funding from the
West _ most notably, the United States _ the machine shows no sign
of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, about 400 Zimbabweans die from AIDS-related illnesses,
most of them likely to have children. It is the same story across
Africa, where new statistics show that 23.3 million people are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In 1998, 2.2 million
Africans died from AIDS-related illnesses; while 200,000 died in
the continent's many wars.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of Zimbabwe's 11 million to 13 million
residents are HIV-positive, the highest AIDS rate in Africa. In
this one country, roughly half the size of Texas, twice as many
people are infected with the AIDS virus than in all of North
America. An estimated 3,000 more are infected each week.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something unexpected happens, virtually all will die.
AIDS already permeates most lives here. Stories of stricken
relatives are as common as comments on the weather. There is a
never-ending parade of funerals. Mortuaries in the major cities _
Harare and Bulawayo _ remain open 24 hours a day to handle the boom
of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic has decimated the country's most productive layer
of society _ the 18- to 40-year-olds who do the work, pay the taxes
and raise the children.
</P>
<P>
   They leave behind legions like Nomsa with little prospect of the
most basic emotional, physical or material necessities.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-by-8-foot shack occupied by Nomsa and her siblings is
surrounded by rusting lean-tos inhabited by tough-looking older
men. The children share a foul-smelling toilet and shower with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   When the children have food, usually a little something provided
by local charities, they cook on a one-burner stove. From time to
time the food is stolen by the lodgers, who pay Nomsa's uncle to
sleep in the hovels that surround the shed.
</P>
<P>
   The structures are behind a slovenly house owned by Nomsa's long
dead grandparents. The children have no legal rights to the
property, which is owned by their uncle. They have no birth
certificates to prove who they are.
</P>
<P>
   The children do laundry once a month when they have soap. The
girls sleep on the one bed inside the shed. The boys sleep on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   None go to school. They can't afford the equivalent of US$6 to
US$10 in fees each per term much less the US$10 it costs each for
uniforms and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And her extended family?
</P>
<P>
   Their uncle wants to evict them. Nomsa has a legal paper from
him demanding that they vacate the property. He has told them he
wants their space so that he can take in a few more paying lodgers.
He complains to the children bitterly about the money they're
costing him by using up his real estate. He has never been violent,
but the children are terrified of him.
</P>
<P>
   Already numbed by her losses, Nomsa cannot seem to get her mind
around this new threat.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where she will go, she has no answer. A tear streams
down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Local charities are struggling with the uncle trying to see if
they don't need to just pay him off to leave the children alone.
The uncle has shown little inclination to be compassionate with his
nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can we do?'' asks Kizito Makore, a volunteer with the
Mashambanzou Charity, noticeably depressed after visiting children.
``They need so much and we have so little to give.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case of Nomsa and her siblings is a bad one, it is
hardly unique.
</P>
<P>
   Before the AIDS epidemic, only 2 percent of African children
were orphaned. The rate now is as high as 11 percent, and UNICEF
expects it to reach 35 percent in Zimbabwe within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those with HIV become infected before the age of 25 and
die while their children are too young to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of orphans comes at a time when extreme poverty has
reduced to near nothing an already feeble social welfare system in
this largely agrarian society. About 63 percent of the people in
Zimbabwe are classified as poor. The unemployment rate is more than
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When AIDS strikes parents, incomes dry up. The family slips
deeper into poverty as it devotes its meager resources to caring
for sick loved ones and eventually transporting a body home and
funeral. In the rural areas, it can cost the equivalent of two
years income to bury a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has shattered the traditional system of extended
families, as witnessed with Nomsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now a fallacy that the African family is there to cushion
the impact on orphans,'' said Marvellous(CQ) Mhloyi, the chair of
population studies at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening economic conditions have pushed relatives to be
indifferent, even callous. ``Human beings are selfish,'' Mhloyi
says. ``Under difficult economic times, that degree of selfishness
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, an uncle or other relative would take control
of the parents' assets but would also assume responsibility for the
well-being of the children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now if the parents die, then the uncle will try to take
the house and other property and depend on others to absorb the
orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   New studies show that AIDS orphans are more likely to be
malnourished than other children. When they go to foster families,
they tend to shoulder heavier workloads than other children already
in the families. They are less likely to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many AIDS orphans, their numbers almost certainly
will rise dramatically. More children live with parents who are
HIV-positive than the number who have already become orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Ngoni Guba, the orphan coordinator for Midland AIDS Service
Organization in Gweru, said the future for these children is grim.
Her organization cares for more than 720 AIDS orphans in central
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are out of school and have no skills training to
allow them to find something to do,'' she says. ``For the boys, you
can foresee delinquency and early manhood. Girls will get married
early _ maybe 15 _ and then what?''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are the most vulnerable. Teenage girls in Africa are eight
times more likely to have AIDS than boys in the same age group.
Most girls get it from older men, ``Sugar Daddies'' who trade sex
for a little money, protection or food.
</P>
<P>
   Many older HIV-infected men will pressure young girls because of
the widely accepted myth in Africa that says a man can be cleansed
of the AIDS virus by having sex with a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a desperate struggle to care for their brothers and
sisters, many teen-age girls turn to prostitution, aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is also making more and more elderly people
parents again, forcing many to consume their already modest savings
on school fees and the other expenses they had assumed were behind
them. Others must resort to backbreaking manual labor to produce
enough food to feed the additional mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these grandparents are at the stage in life when they
need someone to look after them and then suddenly that are forced
to begin again looking after children,'' said Felicity Hatendi,
UNICEF's external relations officer in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   On a disused golf course outside Harare, Lina Smoke sits on the
hard sandy earth in the shade of a peach tree. Not far away are the
two rusting shacks she's called home for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke, who at 88 seems all bone and callous, smiles sweetly at
Terrence, her 4-year-old grandson who now knows her as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence squats beside her, sucking ravenously on the peal of an
orange, a rare treat. Black ants gather under him, attracted by the
drops of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Terrence and his three siblings, Kenneth, 7;
Sharon, 8; and Rovesai, 10, came to their ``ambuya'' _ the local
word for ``granny'' _ after their mother died of AIDS. Their father
was already dead from an AIDS-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   After their mother died, social workers found their ambuya and
delivered the children to her. Smoke says this was the last time
the government gave her anything.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband used to caddy at the gold course, which has been
reclaimed by native weeds, bushes and trees. He built the shacks
himself two decades ago, and they lived together there until he
died five or six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To feed the children, she works the hard dry land to grow corn
and a green leafy vegetable around the shacks. The children, she
laughs, are too young to help her much with the tilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel too tired, I'm so old,'' she says, sitting in
the wilting afternoon heat. ``I feel I'm going to die any time,
even in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what of the children? She looks at Terrence. ``Put them in
a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem today is water. There is none at her home. A
neighbor who used to share now refuses the ambuya and children even
a drop. Another neighbor agreed to supply water but for 100
Zimbabwean dollars a month (a little more than US$2), a shockingly
high price. ``At the moment, I have nothing, so there is no water _
except from the rain,'' she says, clasping her tired, leathery
hands together tightly.
</P>
<P>
   She has another problem. The local government, which owns the
land she occupies, wants to sell off the old golf course and has
told her and the children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So close to the end of her life, she cannot imagine living
elsewhere and indeed knows nowhere to go. ``Soon, I will be gone
and they can just take it all,'' she says. ``I hope they can
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the AIDS orphans end up under the care of their
grandmothers. As little support and assistance as there is for AIDS
orphans, there is less for the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Vlembeu, Zimbabwe's deputy director for social welfare,
said her country's resources are simply too limited to reach AIDS
orphans. In her office in central Harare, she compares the scale of
disaster to Zimbabwe's 1980 war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to deal with children who would be brought to us by
Army officers and others, but now we have to go out and find
them,'' she said. Her department has only one caseworker in each of
57 rural districts. Many don't have cars. ``Some areas are very
weak, and children are suffering because of it,'' she says. ``We
have inadequate resources, but even the meager resources we have,
people cannot access them.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there are efforts to fill this enormous void.
</P>
<P>
   In a small remote valley near the northeastern village of
Mutoko, Jean Cornneck tries to provide orphans something
approximating a home. Cornneck _ called Momma Jean by everyone at
the Mother of Peace home _ says the site was selected by divine
provenance six years ago. She says that clues supplied from God via
a woman in South Africa led the home's founders to this site near
an old leper colony.
</P>
<P>
   On instructions from above, the home accepts no government
support and tries to make itself self-sufficient by farming. ``The
Lord told us to help those infected and affected by AIDS,'' says, a
gentle but forceful woman with a round face and short, snowy hair.
``And that's exactly what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she and volunteers have built a half-dozen cottages.
Each has two rooms for sleeping quarters for children, with as many
as 15 in each Spartan room. Each cottage has a kitchen and small
quarters for a woman, who acts as caretaker but is rewarded with
the title ``momma'' by her charges. Mother of Peace is home to 80
children, 35 of whom are under the age of six.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits. Mother of Peace is at capacity but more
children continue arriving. On once recent day, Momma Jean was
handed a tiny baby, upon whom she immediately began to shower
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Both the baby's parents had died of AIDS and the child's
relatives no longer can care for it. The baby can stay until he is
old enough to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the children at the home have all the signs of AIDS,
many show symptoms of other diseases such as tuberculosis, which is
enjoying a renaissance along with the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of all children under 15 are infected with HIV,
often it came with their mother's milk. In them, the virus lives on
as a morbid connection to mothers and a sad omen of their futures.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In the central Zimbabwean village of Mucheke, Tinashe Cami has
known for some time that he's not healthy. He's on the verge of 16,
yet he is so small and frail that he could easily be mistaken for
10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Children at school have teased him about AIDS because he is so
thin and often is wracked by a cough. A recent test shows he's
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   He lost both his mother and the woman he came to regard as an
aunt to AIDS. He's lucky because a local group pays for his school
fees and uniform. His aunt's sister allows him to remain in the
house, where he has lived the nine years since his mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   He's a good student, even promising at geography and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a soldier and a teacher,'' he says, sitting on
the sofa decorated by his late aunt with a fabric adorned with
Valentine hearts. He likes the idea of being a soldier because he
views the army as a force deployed to help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to teach because he loves children. Even talking about
this ambition causes a smile to break across his face. Despite his
love of children, he has no plans to have any _ in part because of
his illness, but also because he judges the world a poor place for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going this century, it's very hard to think
of having a family.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks of his mother often. ``I remember her face, it was
round and sweet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest moment of his life came during the ceremony held
when his aunt was laid to rest. In Africa, this usually takes
places some time after the body is buried and represents a farewell
and celebration of the departed one's life.
</P>

CITRIX LOOKING AT MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citrix Systems Inc., a leader in the application service
provider market, is casting covetous glances at the region. Ed
Iacobucci, chief technology officer of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based
Citrix, says his firm is likely to establish a major presence here
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seriously looking at Boston as a possible significant
expansion of the Citrix firm,'' Iacobucci said last week. ``We're
going to have some partnerships and probably some acquisitions in
the area.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason: Proximity to EMC Corp.'s Data General business unit,
and the remains of Digital Equipment Corp., now owned by Compaq
Computer Corp. Iacobucci said that Citrix works closely with both
these organizations. ``They've been some of our most significant
supporters of what we're trying to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citrix makes software that lets companies run popular programs
on a central server computer, instead of on each individual
computer in the company. For instance, instead of giving each
worker a copy of Microsoft Corp.'s Excel spreadsheet program,
workers get a small Citrix client program. This client connects to
a Citrix server that runs the Microsoft program remotely. A single
server can provide Excel to dozens of workers in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Major companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Oracle Corp.
have begun offering ASP services, and International Data Corp.
predicts there'll be a $2 billion ASP market by 2003. Iacobucci
thinks Citrix is well-placed to take part in the boom.
</P>
<P>
   The company now employs 1,200 workers, about half in Fort
Lauderdale. Iacobucci said his company will probably take on about
600 workers in the Boston area, many of them through acquisitions
of local firms.
</P>
<P>
   Which local firms? Wait and see, Iacobucci said.

   The new Stephen King ghost story, published last week on the
Internet, threw a nasty scare into the people at Glassbook Inc. in
Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Glassbook is one of the companies chosen to deliver electronic
versions of ``Riding the Bullet,'' the first King story to be
published exclusively on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Glassbook was supposed to provide hundreds of thousands of
electronic copies of the story to people with computers based on
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating systems. Amazon.com, the
Internet's biggest book dealer, relied on Glassbook to handle the
load.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge spike of demand for the book overwhelmed
Glassbook's servers, admitted Tom Diaz, Glassbook's vice president
of product development.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said part of the problem was caused by some new software
his company is using to register the customers' downloads. He says
future electronic book rollouts should go more smoothly, but Diaz
admits mixed feelings about riding this particular bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we're very gratified to suddenly have tens
and tens of thousands of interested customers,'' he said. At the
same time, ``We're disappointed that . . . we've sent a lot of them
away feeling unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A REASON TO BE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that Linux has proven there's demand for an operating system
to rival Microsoft Windows, BeOS is trying to step into the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   BeOS has been floating around for years. But few have embraced
this operating system, despite its strong performance as a platform
for video applications.
</P>
<P>
   But now Be Inc. is getting more aggressive. The company is
copying a key Linux strategy by announcing a giveaway of a
Windows-compatible version of the software, beginning in late
March.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to prime the pump by building a sizable community of
Be users, similar to the millions who now use Linux.
</P>
<P>
   So how will Be make its money? By selling a version of the

 TECHNOLOGY `FUTURIST' GEORGE GILDER A ONE-MAN MARKET FORCE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Kocher was at his desk one Monday morning last July when a
glance at his computer showed that something strange was afoot.
Shares of NorthEast Optic Network of Westborough, where Kocher runs
investor relations, were climbing to unprecedented heights. As he
watched in puzzled amazement, the stock soared higher and higher,
nearly doubling in less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't announced a thing,'' Kocher said. ``There was no
news. Everything was the way it had been when we turned off the
lights Friday night. I said, `What in the world is going on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Kocher checked with stock analysts that he had
an answer. NorthEast Optic was riding one of the most powerful
forces in today's market: the Gilder Effect.
</P>
<P>
   Software giant Novell Inc. saw the power of the Gilder Effect in
December, when its market value rose $2 billion in a single day.
Last month it was tiny Xcelera.com, whose shares climbed 47 percent
in one day. Terayon Communications Systems got two boosts, 28
percent one day in June and 48 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   To find the force propelling these stocks, look beyond the money
managers of Boston, past Massachusetts' high-tech headquarters of
Route 128 and Interstate 495, and stop at the tiny Berkshires town
of Tyringham. On a recent day there, George Gilder, a somewhat
disheveled man with unruly graying hair, was looking out from his
farmhouse and fretting about a decidedly low-tech problem: His
mother's cows had broken from their pen, and one was heading toward
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming to our yard,'' Gilder complained. ``It's going to
redecorate the lawn in due course!''
</P>
<P>
   The bustle of Silicon Valley could not have seemed farther away.
But from Tyringham (population 350), Gilder has built top
credentials as a ``futurist'' and technology analyst: A profile on
the cover of Wired magazine. His own annual technology conference,
which draws industry stars. Status as cofounder of Forbes ASAP, an
influential tech magazine. And now, a cult-like following for the
Gilder Technology Report, his monthly analysis of trends in the
computer and networking sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder has written the newsletter since 1996, but in recent
months it has grown to 50,000 subscribers who pay $295 a year for
the reports. And he has gained the clout to move stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unlikely role for a man who spent three decades as a
kind of roving intellectual, more motivated by ideas than money.
</P>
<P>
   Famously absentminded _ friends say he has turned up at events
with a sock or two missing _ Gilder has been a speechwriter for
Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller, Bob Dole, and Ronald Reagan. His
books on gender in the early 1970s, in which he argued that society
depends on firm, traditional sex roles, prompted the National
Organization for Women to dub him ``Male Chauvinist Pig of the
Year'' in 1973. His 1981 book ``Wealth and Poverty'' became the
bible of the supply-side movement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 60, Gilder is so respected as a technology analyst
that Bell Labs once called a meeting to try to convince him that
his favorite fiber-optic products were going nowhere. Microsoft
Corp.'s Bill Gates summoned Gilder to his office and dressed him
down for writing that the Internet would swamp the giant software
company. Later, Bell Labs adopted the technology Gilder favored,
and Gates embraced the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely ahead of his time,'' said Stephen Garofalo,
who credits a 1992 Gilder article, on the coming era of fiber
optics, with persuading Garofalo to found MetroMedia Fiber Network
Inc. The New York builder of data networks now has a market value
of more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read anyone who's been so consistently on the
money,'' Garofalo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilder Technology Report is packed with details about the
physics of light and the properties of semiconductors. Gilder
celebrates the breakthroughs that allow a disk drive's reading
mechanism to fly 75 billionths of a meter above the disk. In a
single second, he predicts, one fiber-optic cable will soon be able
to carry the same traffic that crossed the Internet in an entire
month three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder starts with the physics, then reasons his way into a
passionate argument about what technologies will succeed or fail.
But many of his subscribers apparently skip the science and troll
for the names of companies Gilder favors. The minute the newsletter
goes online, highlighted companies often see their share prices
soar. In November, investors even bid up a company, Microtest Inc.,
that Gilder had mentioned in passing and was not recommending in
any way.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Gilder portrays himself as a kind of accidental stock
guru. He says he is only telling readers which technologies he
finds the most elegant, not which stocks are about to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't study the prices of these companies,'' he said. ``I
don't write about them because they're low or not write about a
great technology because it's overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gilder Technology Report, like other stock letters,
presents a model portfolio of favored stocks. It also highlights
Gilder's impressive skill as a stock picker. He has backed wireless
company Qualcomm for years, for example, and last year it was the
best performer among the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. Other longtime
picks include some of today's top stars, such as JDS Uniphase, a
maker of fiber-optic components, and Global Crossing, which lays
fiber-optic lines beneath the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report, produced in tandem with Forbes magazine,
is advertised as a tool for making a stock market killing.
``Incredible profits ahead,'' says one advertising flyer. ``Get
rich on the coming technology revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is morally ambiguous,'' Gilder acknowledged. ``I don't
particularly defend it, the way these things are sold.'' Handed a
brochure touting the newsletter, he scans it uncomfortably. ``I let
them do that,'' he said of the Forbes organization. ``It's based on
what I write. But they take my stuff and a copywriter writes it in
this language.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilder himself says he has done well in the stock market. He
owns seven or so stocks from his newsletter's 32-company model
portfolio, including about $500,000 worth of Qualcomm. But he says
he does not buy or sell in tandem with his writing, and that a San
Francisco money manager makes most of his stock decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Gilder fans question his role as a stock guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's excellent in his niche,'' said George Colony, chief
executive of Forrester Research, the Cambridge research firm, who
credits Gilder with being among the first to understand the
Internet phenomenon. ``But this (stock-picking) sounds like it's
outside his niche.''

 UNDATED: ... his niche.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day many years ago, Gilder drove to Philadelphia to watch a
track meet, then flew home to Boston. Back at his house, he noticed
his car was no longer on the street. So he called police to report
it stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I started to think a little more deeply about it,'' he
recalled. The car was still where he parked it in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Friends talk affectionately about his absentmindedness _ the
suit he lost, the string of shoes and socks he has left in hotel
rooms across the country. To them, it is the flip side of his
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks about one thing and pushes the others out of his
head,'' said Bruce Chapman, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   It is a trait that has not always served him well.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder comes from a prominent Yankee family. One great
grandfather ran the Boston &AMP; Albany Railroad, and another was Louis
Comfort Tiffany, famous for his stained-glass lamps. But Gilder did
not grow up wealthy. His father was killed in World War II when
Gilder was 3, and the family lived modestly off its dairy farm. A
friend of his father, David Rockefeller, stepped in to pay the tab
for his education at Exeter and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But at Harvard, he failed courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not focus on more than one subject at a time,'' a
fidgety Gilder said over lunch recently, playing with an empty
Nestea bottle that often shot from his hands and across the table.
``I was kicked out of Harvard, and I don't mean suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Harvard readmitted him, the problem remained. Once,
Henry Kissinger assigned a 30-page paper on arms control. Gilder
turned in a long argument on how arms races can be a helpful
mechanism for pushing scientific advances. But it was 120 pages,
and Kissinger gave him a C.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate Republican in the Rockefeller tradition, Gilder
became a freelance writer and editor for political magazines. Then
in 1971, he unexpectedly broke into the mass media. President Nixon
had vetoed a day-care bill, and Gilder defended the action in an
arcane journal published by the Ripon Society, a Republican group.
He argued that federally subsidized day care merely takes tax money
from stay-at-home mothers and gives it to working mothers, who he
said tend to be wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   The piece immediately became a rallying point for the budding
women's movement, and even Republican women protested. Gilder was
ousted from the Ripon Society. But the controversy put him on
television, debating Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a career as a kind of public intellectual
and provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided this was obviously a hotter subject than liberal
Republicanism,'' Gilder said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder went on to write more about gender and sexuality, saying
that homosexuality and workplace equality led to a variety of
social ills. He also wrote books on race and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   To write ``Wealth and Poverty,'' he says he read 100 books on
economics. Then, in the early 1980s, Gilder became enthralled by
the US semiconductor industry. He devoted himself to studying its
characters and its science. When he noticed that every chip
engineer had a book by Carver Mead on his desk, Gilder moved to the
Caltech campus for several months to study with the famed chip
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carver is the one who taught me how to analyze technology,''
Gilder said. ``He said, `Look at the physics first, not the
markets. Listen to what the technology is telling you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilder began writing more about technology, eventually
persuading Forbes to create a tech supplement called ASAP. It
became an influential publication, and Gilder eventually used it as
a platform to found, along with Forbes, his annual technology
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gilder spends about half his time on the road, giving
speeches and grilling engineers and enterpreneurs about their
companies. His wife, Nini, works from home as an architectural
historian. Together they have home-schooled each of their four
children for at least one year, with Gilder's mother teaching
ancient Greek, Gilder handling science, and Nini teaching other
subjects. His 14-year-old daughter, who is his youngest child, is
being home-schooled this year.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people work for Gilder Technology Group Inc., housed in
an old mill building in the village of Housatonic. In tandem with
Forbes magazine, they run the invitation-only technology conference
and publish three newsletters: the technology report, a report on
trends in the power utilities industry, and a report on companies
leading the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does Gilder see next?
</P>
<P>
   He laid out his ideas recently at the Optical Fiber
Communication Conference, a once-obscure event that drew 18,000
earlier this month to a Baltimore convention center. Gilder was its
keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The computer age is dead, he believes. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs of
Apple, Andy Grove of Intel _ they are the Mount Rushmore of the
industry, towering figures relegated to lifeless stone. Instead of
the computer and the chip, the future belongs to technologies that
speed the movement of data. They include lasers that slice light
into thousands of data-carrying wavelengths, fiber-optic strands to
carry the light, and newfangled wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder is a bandwidth evangelist. Today we are tethered to 56K
modems and frustrated by what he calls the ``World Wide Wait,'' but
Gilder says we will soon be awash in bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   What this will feel like remains a bit obscure, but Gilder
thinks a wave of small computerized gizmos is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be as portable as your watch, as personal as your
wallet,'' he told the engineers in Baltimore. ``They'll recognize
speech, navigate streets. They'll perform transactions, collect
your news and your mail, and they'll read it to you if you want.
They'll perform a wide array of functions that are hard to
anticipate today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just may not do Windows,'' he added, in a swipe at
Microsoft, which he believes is ill-prepared for this future.
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared its approval, and afterward Gilder was
crowded by people seeking his autograph. But as with many of his
readers, they weren't there to thank Gilder the analyst. They
wanted to meet Gilder the stock guru and ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I keep Global Crossing?'' (Sure. The company may soon
be acquired.)
</P>
<P>
   ``How will high oil prices affect broadband?'' (They make
communications technology look more attractive.)
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Soslow was in the crowd trailing Gilder from the
convention hall, listening to his every word. ``I've certainly
gotten something out of my $295,'' said Soslow, a Pennsylvania
money manager, referring to the newsletter subscription price.
``Hundreds of thousands of dollars more.'' He rushed back to listen
to Gilder. ``I can't talk,'' he said. ``This is pretty valuable for
me.''

GETTING THE LEDS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before too long, most of the traffic lights you stop at may not
be lights at all, but jumbo versions of the light-emitting diodes
you now commonly see in bedside digital alarm clocks and home
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   With a push from conservation-minded utilities, public works
departments and highway agencies around the United States are
increasingly swapping out red lights in traffic signals with diodes
that use up to 90 percent less electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred, in fact, are already in use around
Massachusetts. But they remain a small minority and, nationally,
transportation officials estimate that 92 percent of traffic
signals still use incandescent bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The way to tell whether a signal is using a bulb or an LED is
that the diode looks like a collection of dots arranged in a circle
_ most commonly red, because red diodes are cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   Though the timing difference is slight, it will appear that the
LED turns on more quickly. The average human eye can perceive the
several hundredths of a second it takes an incandescent bulb to
reach full brightness, while an LED begins glowing almost
instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost of producing diodes falls, a whole host of new
applications are emerging, including brake lights in cars, exit
sign lights in office buildings, airport runway beacons, and even
home lighting.
</P>
<P>
   LED technology has been around for a little over 40 years, but
the standard joke in photonics circles for years was that you could
get an LED in any color you wanted, as long as it was red. Only in
recent years have researchers developed ways to create a range of
colors through using materials such as indium, arsenic, gallium
nitride, and other semiconducting solids that glow when zapped with
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a cost-effective and eye-pleasing way is worked out to
produce white light from LEDs, future-minded home designers dream
of creating houses where artificial light is generated by a single
``light plant,'' then spread out through LED fibers embedded like
stars in ceilings and walls.
</P>
<P>
   LEDs could create balanced low-shadow indoor light at much less
cost than incandescent or even fluorescent bulbs. Plus, it would
just look cool to have an LED-studded living-room ceiling that
looked like the sky on a clear January night.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, automotive designers have begun using LEDs instead of
hard-to-replace bulbs for middle rear brake lights and other car
lights. Some envision filling car interiors with diodes to
eliminate the need to ever replace lightbulbs.
</P>
<P>
   But to get to widespread use, the cost of LEDs still needs to
plunge considerably. Officials with the Consortium for Energy
Efficiency Inc., a Boston-based group that lobbies for more
efficient home and office appliances, think a stepped-up effort to
replace traffic signal lights with LEDs could not only save
millions of dollars in wasted energy but also serve as a
market-driving application for the technology to get its cost down
and credibility up.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, consortium officials estimate, at least $250 million
is spent each year on electricity for the country's estimated 3.1
million traffic signals. That is probably eight to nine times more
than necessary. A typical yellow light, for example, loses 80
percent of its light to filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the vast majority of energy used for an
incandescent bulb only generates heat, up to 98 percent of the
electricity put into a red LED emerges as light. And because
traffic signals run 24 hours a day, making them more efficient can
directly reduce the risk of power failures on hot summer afternoons
by cutting base load on power grids.
</P>
<P>
   One big hangup is the way most municipal and state governments
pay for traffic lights, through an annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven years, the cost of installing and operating a red LED
may be less than half the cost of an incandescent bulb. Utilities
such as NStar (parent of Boston Edison and Commonwealth Electric)
and the New England Electric System companies will give generous
rebates for buying the LEDs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, leading manufacturers such as Dialight Corp. of
Manasquan, N.J., and Ecolux Inc. of Lachine, Quebec, have developed
diodes that can be installed in minutes by swapping out the light
bulb and its housing and splicing the power line into the back of
the LED. Diodes can last seven to 10 years, while the long-life
incandescent bulbs used in traffic signals typically must be
replaced every 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite some clear advantages, the $120 to $140 upfront
cost of a red LED (even with a utility rebate) _ and up to $275 for
a green _ makes buying a $2.50 incandescent every year look cheaper
when it's a question of just making it to the end of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the word out that this is good
technology,'' said Thomas J. Coughlin Jr. of New England Electric.
``But there have been some shortcomings, mostly the price. In the
next year or two we are going to make a really concerted effort to
try to educate the market.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If I had been alive during the Renaissance, my
excess girth would be considered beautiful. But today those of us
with a spare tire and a double chin are thought of as, to put it
politely, physically unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's not all. Studies have shown that people
who are considered attractive are also more likely to get a job and
be considered smarter than those who are less pleasing to the eye.
Society even punishes those who are unattractive. They're less
likely to receive raises and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The ideals about what is and what is not physically attractive
change over time. You can't fix what society says about your shape.
However, you can fix how you feel about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are continually unhappy with your body, you'll be
carrying around a lot of baggage emotionally,'' said Drew Anderson,
assistant professor of psychology and co-director of a study
sponsored by the Albany Medical Center and the State University of
New York at Albany. The study is designed to measure weight loss on
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 weeks on LEARN, a weight-loss program based on behavior
modification, the 10 members of the group had varying levels of
success. We had learned in previous sessions that, now in our
middle ages, we'd most likely never return to the slim and trim
physiques of youth. With only two weeks to go in the study, we were
learning to accept things we couldn't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being physically beautiful does not make you happy,'' Anderson
said. ``Happiness does not go with weight loss. We have to get
people to say, `I don't have to lose weight to be happier.'''
</P>
<P>
   One way to become more content with your body, Anderson said, is
to look for improvements in the overall quality of your life. For
instance, has the weight loss I have achieved lowered my
cholesterol level? Has starting an exercise regimen made me more
able to do things I enjoy? Am I better able to manage my eating
habits now that I know the difference between physical and
psychological hunger?
</P>
<P>
   Other ways to deal with body image problems include changing
your perception of yourself. Thomas Cash, a professor of psychology
at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and author of ``The
Body Image Workbook'' (New Harbinger Publications), advocates
retraining emotional reactions instead of trying to attack
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Do people perceive themselves wrongly? Or do
they perceive themselves accurately and are they unhappy with it?''
Anderson asks the group.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to be happy with your body isn't easy. Begin by
spending some time with yourself. Ask yourself if you've avoided
social or interpersonal relationships because of your weight. Which
of your body parts do you like the least? Which do you think are
the most attractive? Develop a list of body parts from the least to
the most disturbing to you.
</P>
<P>
   Next, expose yourself to those body parts that upset you. Start
with the least upsetting and take a good look at yourself. Got cute
ankles? Go ahead. Look at 'em in the mirror, turn those toes so you
can see those beautiful ankles from all sides. Bend over and take a
picture of 'em. Bet Cindy Crawford doesn't have ankles that look
this good. Set a video camera on the floor and walk past it,
recording those gorgeous joints.
</P>
<P>
   Sound silly?
</P>
<P>
   It may even feel silly at first. But then do the same with your
next favorite part, and the next, and the next, until you're able
to look at your least attractive part with the same affection. The
goal is to accept the weight that you cannot lose.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're happy with your self-image, you'll be free to do
things out of choice, not out of fear. Imagine, buying a swimsuit
and being comfortable enough in it to go to the beach without a
wrap.

CHANGING THE WORLD _ ONE COMPUTER AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If there's a hot phrase floating in Silicon
Valley these days, it's ``ubiquitous computing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the notion of having thousands of computers for every human
being on the planet. What's more, these computers all talk to one
another, organizing and making decisions on their humans' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Intel Corp. cast its imprimatur on the topic by
hosting a three-day conference at the Hyatt Hotel on ubiquitous
computing. The Santa Clara, Calif., chipmaker invited about 350
scientists to envision a future in which billions of computers are
embedded into everyday objects. The underlying implication, of
course, is that many of those computers will have Intel inside.
</P>
<P>
   An often-used example of ubiquitous computing is the
computerized car that senses a crash, deploys an airbag, and
notifies the nearest police station of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate that it walks the talk, Intel provided hundreds
of laptops that scientists used to send messages to one another, to
set up group chats, or to comment on what was being presented, much
like the way grade school children pass around notes during class.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientific luminaries from the University of
California at Berkeley, the Masssachusetts Institute of Technology,
AT&AMP;T, Xerox Corp., and other institutions paraded their research.
The audience heard about ``knowbots,'' ``silicon inchworm motors,''
and what it means to have a ``robot ecology'' where machines
amiably coexist with humans.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Woszczyna and Mike Schneider, scientists from
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, were impressed with the
presentation on ``Smart Dust,'' a project at Berkeley where
engineers are working to build computers no larger than a cubic
millimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was cool,'' said Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have millions of these little computers spread out,
all communicating and constantly updating people on weather
patterns or road conditions,'' Woszczyna agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Then Schneider added: ``But you could also see it being used by
the military to sense where people are walking.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the conversation turned toward ethics. Do governments
have a responsibility to limit technology that can be used toward
destructive ends? Do scientists have an obligation to respect
people's privacy and safety when creating new technologies? Will
there be so many computers around that humans will become slaves to
their creations? Will these machines run amok?
</P>
<P>
   The questions were reminiscent of a ``Star Trek'' episode in
which millions of tiny computers organized a protest and demanded
better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Such weighty issues were not in evidence downstairs in the
hotel's Pacific Concourse, where engineers showcased their latest
inventions for changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular, judged unscientifically by the size of the
crowds that gathered around the display, was Joseph Paradiso's
computerized shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradiso, a principal research scientist at MIT's Media
Laboratory and technology director for the Things That Think
Consortium at MIT, demonstrated how his shoe generates power each
time the wearer strikes the heel or bends the sole. The idea is to
help people-on-the-go power up their cellular phones, pagers, and
electronic organizers, literally without having to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But the shoe, like many other techno-delights here, were far
from making it on to store shelves. To generate enough power to
refuel a single cell phone battery, a person would have to walk
``about 500 hours,'' said Paradiso.
</P>
<P>
   One gadget closer to hitting the commercial road was the
wireless digital pen from Intel, set to be introduced next year for
less than $100. It writes ink, like any other pen. At the same
time, the pen translates what is being written into a nearby
computer and saves the words as typewritten characters.
</P>
<P>
   Other gadgets on display included a virtual reality contraption
from Columbia University, and a three-in-one verbal language
translator, navigation system, and travel guide from
Carnegie-Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is interesting, but not practical,'' said Rob
Enderle, an analyst with the Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
``You get the sense that it's technology for its own sake, as
opposed to identifying problems and then using technology to solve
them. There's so much technology coming at us so fast that it
creates more problems than it solves.''

NEWCOMERS JUMPING ON THE INCUBATOR BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word ``incubator'' has a safe, warm, motherly ring. But
today's high-tech incubators are less about hatching eggs than fast
fortunes. And there are plenty of foxes trying to claw their way
into the hen house.
</P>
<P>
   Incubators _ first set up to finance and nurture new businesses
_ have become a booming industry. New ones are springing up every
day. Some are backed by venture capital firms. Others are rising
from the ashes of failed businesses as opportunists recast
themselves as investors in start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 incubators across the continent and some
have curious roots. Recent arrivals include a Nevada casino gaming
company, a New York plastics company, two Canadian gold-mining
concerns, and a New Jersey e-tailer whose IPO was a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is silliness time,'' says Tom Crotty, a general partner
at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass. ``All these guys are going
to try to be early-stage venture capitalists, and many of them have
no experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional venture capitalists like Crotty see incubators as
competition. They prefer to get in on a hot idea early themselves,
before an incubator has pumped up the value of the company and
taken a huge ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   But that bias aside, there are some unlikely companies jumping
into the incubator scene. Take Jackpot Enterprises Inc., a Las
Vegas gaming-machine company that this month changed its name to J
Net Enterprises and launched a $100 million venture fund.
</P>
<P>
   Jackpot couldn't put its betting machines in bars, restaurants,
and grocery stores outside of Nevada because of regulatory
restrictions. So it's selling that business and getting into
early-stage venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   J Net does boast some big-name executives and directors,
including the founders of online news site CBS Marketwatch.com,
Allan Tessler and Alan Hirschfield, who formerly ran Columbia
Pictures and 20th Century Fox. J Net also has bought a controlling
interest in a Manhattan venture firm Meister Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brothers, Todd Meister, says: ``We call ourselves a
corporate incubator. We want to help branded companies migrate to
the online world.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question for J Net and other incubator newcomers: Are
people who failed with their last public company qualified to pick
and back new ventures?
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the board of Touchstone Software Corp. of
North Andover voted to sell off its operating units, change its
name to Touchstone Capital Group, and become a B2B Internet
incubator. Its stock trades around $2.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jordex Resources, a Vancouver, British Columbia, company
that's giving up mining for Internet gold-digging: It's new name is
iTech Capital Corp. Another ex-mining company, Vengold, has changed
its name to itemus and declares on its Web site: ``Prepare for the
E-Dream team.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barry, senior editor of The Corporate Venturing Report in
Wellesley, warns against falling for quick make-overs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a lot of money out there,'' he says. ``But
who's behind the money? What's their background?''
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial that entrepreneurs know who they're dealing with.
No company with a decent idea should sell its soul for $500,000 and
a few desks and phones. As a guideline, venture capitalists say, a
young company these days can get $15 million and give up around
half its ownership stake. An incubator shouldn't get the same stake
for far less money and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The new players are surely lulled by the success of incubator
pioneers like Silicon Valley's idealab, which launched eToys,
GoTo.com, and CarsDirect.com. Incubating has the appearance of easy
money, a way to get in on technology early, take it public, and
ride the bull market for Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the opportunity to take the incubator itself public
_ perhaps the main driver for some entrants. It's hard to resist
the success of Andover's CMGI Inc. and Internet Capital Group of
Wayne, Pa., venture firms with hot public stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital Group last week kicked off an incubator of its
own, eColony. No small ambitions from the established player: It
aims to fund 100 B2B start-ups in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AnswerLogic lands $10m
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's (at)Ventures Technology Fund is betting $10 million on
AnswerLogic Inc. as a leader in self-help customer service on the
Web. The funding is a second round for the Washinton, D.C. company,
whose first round came from Novak Biddle Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Online customer service is a hot issue. Says AnswerLogic chief
executive Paul Jacobs: ``It's a problem that's been building as
commerce on the Internet has increased.'' The company's software
lets consumers ask questions online in plain English.

A LEAP FOR URBAN HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR;  _ Maybe you saw the number in a passing headline
_ $2 trillion. It was the successor to the number in another
headline six years ago _ $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, these huge sums don't refer to a big mess, like
the federal debt. They involve just about the only bright spot in
the housing picture. For at least half the country it is the
biggest economic issue next to income itself.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Fannie Mae, the biggest financial services
corporation in the world that isn't a bank, announced a commitment
amid considerable skepticism to invest $1 trillion in housing that
matters most _ for 10 million families in underserved urban
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Fannie Mae's CEO, Frank Raines, announced that the
federally chartered institution will double that in this decade,
helping bring housing within reach of another 18 million families.
Within that commitment is another one aimed at a growing crisis in
American cities _ shrinking supply and exploding demand for
affordable rental housing.
</P>
<P>
   When you talk ``national housing policy,'' this level of action
merits far more attention than it gets. Since it went private more
than 30 years Fannie Mae has been at the center of the American
homeownership miracle. Because of its federal charter, it can raise
vast sums in credit markets on favorable terms. Using those funds
to buy mortgages from the outfits that issue them is the core of a
``secondary'' market that is essential to the rapid flow of loans
to homebuyers and apartment developers.
</P>
<P>
   What the first $1 trillion commitment under Raines's
predecessor, Jim Johnson, represented was a herculean effort to
push the envelope, using the leverage of the company's purchasing
power to influence changes for the better in lending patterns. In
practice that has meant lower down payments and other innovative
ways of getting working families of limited means through the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   With the new commitment, half of Fannie Mae's business will be
in underserved urban and rural communities and among low-income
families and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae's immensity and clout inevitably draw an unfair share
of sniping, a fact of life in a hothouse like Washington. Andrew
Cuomo's Department of Housing and Urban Delelopment is a
too-frequent offender. So, too, are sharpies in the banking
business who have hired lobbyists to try to break off high-margin,
high-interest-rate business. Fannie Mae's record, more than just
its power, has tended to keep the junior varsity wolves at bay.
</P>
<P>
   What ought to be of concern is the growing crisis in
affordability, especially for renters. The tip of this iceberg is
the scourge of homelessness, as well as the booming business done
by food banks to help families nearly starved by the expenditure of
excessive portions of their income for often-inadequate shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need partners,'' says Boston Mayor Tom Menino, who like
many of his colleagues focused on the problem in his State of the
City message this year. ``You can't begin to solve this problem
alone because of the amount of capital involved, but the state
governments and the federal government have stepped away from the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   With supply tight and rents exorbitant, responses like Menino's
are by definition small, however vigorous. His need for partners
can be filled in part by Fannie Mae. The company financed $50
billion in multifamily housing last year. It will raise that number
to $175 billion, serving 4 million renting families. It already is
the largest investor in federal low-income-housing tax credits and
local bonds that help finance multifamily housing. The company also
will expand the market for smaller properties (with up to 50 units)
and for owner-occupied buildings with two to four units that are
such a staple in older urban neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   This is an astonishingly bold set of ventures, but mayors like
Menino believe there remains an opening for more federal
initiative. Their focus is not on a new program but on tax policy,
specifically the reforms of 1986 that ended the special tax breaks
(via accelerated depreciation schedules) for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with that law,'' says Menino, ``is that it hit
everything hard, especially affordable housing projects, and not
just the windfall that was going to commercial real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right to suggest that the federal surplus should make
possible a targeted reincarnation of tax incentives for apartment
units that lower-income families can afford. It would be a natural
issue for Al Gore, given its equal relevance to close-in suburbs as
well as urban cores. And it would be natural for a conservative
like George W. Bush if he didn't plan to spend the surplus on
income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae's new commitment makes two points. For more than a
decade its innovations have been a model for forward-looking
business behavior. And the company also serves as a gold-plated
yardstick by which to measure the inadequacy of nearly every other
public and private player.

<P>
   The approaching Easter season is a time of resurrection, faith
and belief. Now, out of the catacombs of history comes new
information that will startle skeptics and make the heart of
believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew _ not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought _ and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement,'' Moffett says. ``The surprise, of course, is the
mention of Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records _ the New Testament's Book
of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers _ confirm some of
Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter had entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did
not preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from
persecution to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles _ Judas having
hanged himself _ it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it were the first and only
gospel written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred
texts with them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of
Paul's travels, and it was this Gospel of Matthew that Pantaenus
found a century and a half later in India.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jews of the early centuries, Pantaenus became a
follower of Jesus. But it is not only Pantaenus' academic
background as philosopher, his founding of the great theological
school in Alexandria and his two renowned disciples, Clement and
Origen, that make him so important here.
</P>
<P>
   As Moffett writes, ``The fact that Pantaenus was ... Jewish ...
explains his particular attention to the Hebrew copy of the Gospel
of Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before 50 AD and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second-century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th-century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century AD., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
AD, tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that anti-Semitism was involved in some New
Testament research and that ``some German scholars in the 1930s and
even earlier were anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But there is other evidence that, if anything, Aramaic and Greek
took a back seat to Hebrew among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox rabbi and Talmudic scholar Dov Brisman of Philadelphia
said the Talmud implies that the two great sages of Judaism in 100
BC, Hillel and Shammai, ``spoke Hebrew to one another.'' He also
said the Aramaic version of the Bible was discontinued because Jews
only read the Holy Scriptures in the original Hebrew so that
nothing would be lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scholars also assert that Aramaic was not the only
Semitic language used by Jews in Israel before and at the time of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper presented to the Leeds University Oriental Society in
1966 called, ``Qumran to Edessa,'' J.C.L. Gibson wrote, ``No doubt
that Jews of the homeland continued to speak Hebrew in the everyday
life still into the Christian epoch _ otherwise how can we explain
the emergence of the late form of Hebrew known as Mishnaic
Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the seminary's former president, provided
the coup de grace to the whole matter, saying, ``Did not Paul speak
to Jews at Jerusalem in Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   How could scholars miss this well-known passage of scripture in
the Book of Acts dealing with Paul's arrest by the Romans and his
defense before Jewry?
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he (the chief captain) had given him license, Paul
stood on the stairs ... And when there was a great silence, he
spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue ... And when they heard that he
spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence...''
(Acts 21: 39 through Acts 22: 2)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book, ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

FEAR MUZZLES THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I prefer my law enforcement officials to be like German
shepherds _ smart, vigilant, and at times, fierce. Right now,
though, Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans and Attorney General
Thomas Reilly are acting like a pair of French poodles _ prancing
around the muck that comes with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after a Boston police captain quietly revived
the investigation into the Boston Strangler murders, Evans and
Reilly have slammed the door shut, worried not in the least about
truth, but consumed by the fallout on their careers.
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is this: Few detectives who investigated the
Strangler case back in the early and mid-1960s believe that Albert
DeSalvo, the confessed killer of 13 women, murdered anyone at all.
DeSalvo was slain in Walpole State Prison in 1973 without having
been charged with even one of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, according to detectives, lawyers, and people who
have studied it since, the spree was not the result of a lone
strangler, but rather one or two serial killers followed by several
copycat murderers who buried their deeds and their dead in the
raging headlines of the times.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation back then was phenomenally, fundamentally
flawed. Police departments in the municipalities where the murders
occurred did not share vital information. A politically motivated
task force was convened by an attorney general _ Edward Brooke _
who had his eye on higher office. The man in charge of the team,
John Bottomly, was widely described as an incompetent. And the
biggest proponent of DeSalvo's guilt was his own lawyer, F. Lee
Bailey, who was pushing for an insanity verdict in a string of
unrelated crimes.
</P>
<P>
   All of which becomes important now because of this simple,
logical conclusion: Someone, perhaps even several people, may have
gotten away with murder. They could very well be alive. And two of
the state's leading law enforcement officials _ Evans and Reilly _
don't particularly seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   When news first broke in this space last July that Captain Tim
Murray, head of the highly regarded Cold Case Squad, had taken aim
at the Strangler case, police brass dived for cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``A technical exercise,'' Evans described it. Others downplayed
it even further, ignoring the fact that detectives and lab
civilians had already accumulated a massive pile of old evidence
and had dozens more boxes to find. One police report indicated the
existence of cotton swabbings from a victim's midsection _ a DNA
jackpot, if they could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the search for evidence was halted before the
difficult work ever began; the Cold Case Squad was temporarily
disbanded, and Murray was promoted out of the job.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Evans said he didn't want to cause any emotional pain
for the victim's families. But that excuse fell flat when families
of some of the dead pushed for a revived investigation. Relatives
of Mary Sullivan, the final victim, are so convinced DeSalvo wasn't
the killer that they recently offered to exhume her body for DNA
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're demanding answers, and we feel like we can't get help
from anyone,'' said her nephew, Casey Sherman. DeSalvo's family has
also offered to dig up his corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Police remain unbowed. ``We are not just going to jump into a
situation that leaves us with little hope and in some sense no hope
of completing an investigative effort,'' said Deputy Superintendent
Paul Farrahar, the head of the homicide unit.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's people are even more timid. ``It doesn't make sense for
an AG's office to get involved in homicides, and we don't do
that,'' said Gerard Leone, the head of the criminal division.
</P>
<P>
   But Leone ignores the fact that the attorney general got
involved in 1964 and may have fouled the investigation. Now the
trail of old evidence runs directly through Reilly's office, with
much of it leading to musty archives and the cellars of retired
state officials.
</P>
<P>
   So why the reticence? Evans and Reilly, two decent,
forward-thinking men, are loath to confront problems that preceded
them _ problems that may beget problems. And like a good lawyer,
they rarely ask questions in which the answers aren't preordained.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a reason there's no statute of limitations on
murder. It's a crime so heinous that neither time nor effort should
stand in the way of solving it. It's not their choice, but their
job to pursue the Strangler case. And when they do, Boston may come
to grips with another demon from its past.

WHERE CROWE FLIES, SUCCESS FOLLOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy who specializes in coming off as mean as a Tasmanian
devil, Russell Crowe sure knows how to make friends.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the New Zealand-born, Australia-raised actor's
remarkable, ever-more-impressive chameleon abilities probably make
that easier than it would be for most people. After all, the
35-year-old Crowe was more than convincing as the whistleblowing
American scientist Jeffrey Wigand _ a man nearly 20 years the
actor's senior and some 50 pounds larger _ in ``The Insider,'' the
tobacco and media industry expose that's earned Crowe his first
Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Wigand is an immensely paranoid and difficult
individual, whom Crowe captures in all of his furtive,
hair-trigger, depressive glory. Or that Crowe's last major U.S.
performance, as the ``L.A. Confidential'' cop whose uncontrollable
rages make the Rampart Division gang look like choirboys by
comparison. Or that in his next film, the May release
``Gladiator,'' he plays a Roman general turned Coliseum superstar
whose capacity for close-quarters killing is matched only by his
murderous hatred of the emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood loves this guy. And in his rough-hewn, Down Under way,
Crowe humbly appreciates the current expressions of it.
</P>
<P>
   `I think I'm in a very privileged position,'' the deceptively
jocular, deeply committed actor says. ``A lot of people have had
long and stellar careers and have never been acknowledged by their
peers or critically in the way that I have been this year. So I
don't have a humorous or cynical viewpoint on it; I'm just very
thankful for the position that I'm in.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Gladiator'' director Ridley Scott, it's the movie
industry that should be thankful for someone of Crowe's talent and
screen charisma at this point in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell is very inventive and experienced _ he's done quite a
few movies and some 30-odd plays, which is a lot of work at his age
_ but it's something else that you want,'' says Scott (``Alien,''
``Blade Runner,'' ``Thelma &AMP; Louise''). ``You can get a great actor
who disappears when you put him on screen; he sort of drops back as
opposed to comes right up. But Russell's got that burn, he's very
strong on screen. Some people say the camera loves him, but it's
not that, it's just him. In his age bracket, about the only other
male actor you can say that about today is Tom Cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is saying similarly complimentary things about Crowe _
these days. His ``Gladiator'' co-workers wax nostalgic about the
extra effort Crowe went to to make the grueling, five-month filming
of the picture on the Mediterranean island of Malta as fun as
possible _ hosting parties, renting boats for weekend sailing
excursions, printing up special T-shirts he'd hand out to cast and
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans are a funny creature, mate,'' Crowe says with a shrug.
``You can't just continuously demand from them effort without
showing them that they're appreciated, y'know? And I demanded that
everyone here remained completely involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But before he became the ideal collaborator, Crowe had a
reputation for impatience and not suffering fools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a young, developing actor like Russell
has to defend himself when he comes on the set and protect his
work,'' notes cinematographer Dante Spinotti, who shot Crowe's
first American film, ``The Quick and the Dead,'' as well as ``L.A.
Confidential'' and ``Insider.'' ``He needs everybody to concentrate
and pay attention to what they are doing. I think it's a very
positive feature for an actor, knowing what he wants to do and
where he wants to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe certainly knows what he's about. He's been acting
professionally since early childhood _ and was destined for a
show-business career well before that. The grandson of a
cinematographer, Crowe grew up on film sets that his parents
catered meals for. He made his acting debut at age 6 on a
television series called ``Spy Force.'' And although there have
been several detours along the career path _ he still plays what he
claims is mediocre guitar for his 16-year-old band, Gruntland _
movie acting is clearly his lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies, for me, are like the last circle in the concentric
spiral; I just always knew that this was my job,'' Crowe says.
``Now, I can't sit down and jam on a guitar with Eric Clapton with
any level of confidence. But I can jam with any actor who walks the
planet and know, with absolute confidence, that I will fulfill the
needs of my character.''
</P>
<P>
   This was proven by the extended ``Insider'' encounters between
Crowe and Al Pacino, perhaps the greatest living scene-stealer in
the acting universe. For the astonishing Wigand impersonation,
Crowe bleached his hair seven times, had to get his mouth around a
New York accent with Bluegrass inflections (since all of Wigand's
tobacco-related lingo was learned in Kentucky) and even went
through boxes and boxes of glasses before settling on the precisely
right style. Then there was gaining all those pounds _ and losing
them with alarming speed when he had to reach fighting weight for
``Gladiator'' right afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of that and a thousand other painstaking steps,
Crowe was too nervous to watch his first portrayal of an actual
individual once director Michael Mann cut ``The Insider'' together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sat and watched that movie and I didn't see Jeff Wigand,
then I'd have been shown up, I couldn't do my gig,'' he explains.
``That's how I felt, so I kept making excuses to Michael about why
I couldn't make any of the screenings. He finally cornered me and I
had to watch it; and it was OK, because I did see Jeff Wigand in
there a couple of times, which was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's devotion to acting is matched only by his interest in _
are you ready? _ cattle. He runs 270 head of Angus beef on his
560-acre ranch in Australia, and can go on at mind-boggling length
about animal husbandry and the kinds of grass best-suited for
grazing in the arid environment.
</P>
<P>
   But there's not been much time for cow-punching lately. These
days, Crowe is hopping between Poland and Ecuador, filming the
romantic political thriller ``Proof of Life'' with Meg Ryan. After
recording a new album in Texas this summer and taking in the Sydney
Olympics, he starts up Jodie Foster's next directing effort,
``Flora Plum,'' in which he'll play a circus sideshow freak.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe admits that the workload has gotten to be a bit much. But
he probably wouldn't want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the madness would just calm down for a little while,
y'know?'' he acknowledges. ``However, having said that, it's my
choice to make films. It's the thing that I like to do. By rights,
I should be sleeping, but at the moment I'm making a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another reason why Hollywood loves this guy. But will they
love him enough to hand him that Oscar statuette Sunday night? We
ask Crowe what he thinks his chances are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't go there, mate,'' he says. ``Sorry. I'm a great believer
in karma and I'm just going to live in the moment. I'm an Academy
Award-nominated actor for the rest of my career, regardless of what
happens or what junk I do. And put it this way: The worst that I
can come in is second.''

   COURT-SMOKING (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rejects the
Clinton administration's plan to regulate cigarettes as legal
drugs, ending the federal government's main anti-smoking
initiative. In a 5-4 ruling, the court says Food and Drug
Administration regulators overreached three years ago when they
claimed power over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. By MARK HELM.

   McCAIN-RETURNS (Washington) _ John McCain comes back to the

   BUSH-MCCAIN (Washington) _ George W. Bush and John McCain will
imperil Republicans' chances of retaking the White House and

both should then go after the McCain supporters, many of whom,

big deal. It was the first break between Bush and his congressional

the last. By MARIANNE MEANS.

MEMOIR OF `COLORS' IS TINTED IN BEIGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN 
By Da Chen 
Random House. 310 pp. $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the curiosities of the American book-publishing scene is
the continuing interest in a genre best described as ``cultural
revolution memoirs,'' accounts of growing up in the People's
Republic of China during the 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   These began appearing more than a dozen years ago, as China was
opening to the outside world, and young Chinese who had been swept
up in that turmoil _ or had taken an active part as Red Guards _
came to the West as graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those early accounts, published in the late 1980s and
early 1990s (among them Gao Yuan's ``Born Red'' and Jung Chang's
``Wild Swans'') have stood the test of time and hold permanent
places as important firsthand documents of Mao Zedong's chaotic
experiment in political engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But while the blood has run thin and most such memories have
lost their punch, still these memoirs keep appearing. Most come
from academic presses and quickly disappear from bookstore shelves
(rarely into the hands of book-buyers). Occasionally, however, a
major trade publisher brings one of them out, with a hefty advance
to the author and a promotional budget.
</P>
<P>
   Such is ``Colors of the Mountain'' by Da Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is 37, the child of a small landlord family in Fujian
province (identified, in the curious practice of Anglicizing China
place names, as ``Yellow Stone Village''). The family seems to have
endured the years of the Cultural Revolution with relatively little
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Chen himself endured some taunting from classmates but seems to
be a natural winner _ the brightest boy in town, the best at both
the violin and Ping-Pong. He won admission to the Beijing Language
Institute to study English, then came to the United States in 1985.
He studied at Union College in Lincoln, Neb., and Columbia
University Law School and then worked at a Wall Street law firm. He
now lives in upstate New York with his wife, a physician, and their
two children.
</P>
<P>
   And he has now written a book. The problem is not that ``Colors
of the Mountain'' is bad. It is that it is nowhere near what it
could have been.
</P>
<P>
   As a coming-of-age memoir, it is passable but too generic. There
is little sense of time or place. Absent the Chinese names of his
schoolmates _ and the very, very occasional reference to specific
political events _ it could describe a bright kid's growing up in
Somerville and getting into Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   For Da Chen, the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution seems to
have involved a lot of time spent sneaking cigarettes with his
buddies and fantasizing about girls.
</P>
<P>
   And the language is too often unnecessarily American-colloquial.
As he studies for the national entrance exam that will determine
his getting into college, Chen writes that without ``a scheme, a
method,'' he ``could easily kiss the books and my life good-bye and
say hello to the rice paddies.'' As for college men he'd read
about, ``all the girls dreamed about them (and) they kicked ass in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are so many wasted opportunities in which
``Colors of the Mountain'' could have been so much more.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of Mao in 1976, his wife, Jiang Qing, and three
of her political allies were denounced as ``The Gang of Four'' and
arrested. The political fallout reaches into the furthest corners
of the country. After the local party chief flees to avoid arrest,
Yellow Stone Village puts on a play to celebrate the downfall of
the Gang of Four. Chen is cast as the writer and editor Yao Wenyuan
(misidentified in the text as ``Yiao''), and one of his schoolmates
as Madame Mao herself.
</P>
<P>
   We learn what Chen's costume was _ padded stomach and shoes
``two sizes too big'' _ and that his classmate ``would curl his
little finger as he held a cigarette, and push his boobs up once in
a while, whenever the sponges inside his dress dropped too low.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was the political and cultural context of all this?
Were such plays presented throughout China at that time? How did
this relate to the propaganda shows that were a fixture of the
Cultural Revolution? Was there a standard script? Who decided to
turn Madame Mao into a comic figure? Or was she turned into a evil
figure at the play's end? What a missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the real problem here is that as more and more Americans
visit China _ or even go there to study or to work _ China becomes
less exotic. To succeed in that context, memoirs such as this need
to offer more than passably told coming-of-age reminiscences.

NO STRINGS, BUT THE GIRLS WILL SWOON ANYWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen. Can you hear it?
</P>
<P>
   If you tune your ears just right, you'll hear the cacophonous
clamor of millions of teenage girls stampeding through record
stores to buy 'N Sync's just-released sophomore album _ as well as
the unholy groan and wail of millions convinced that anything by
any so-called ``boy band'' is yet another sign of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting that 'N Sync's ``No Strings Attached'' will be
humongous _ perhaps equaling or even eclipsing the single-week 1.1
million sales record set by the rival boy band Backstreet Boys with
last year's ``Millennium '' _ is like predicting that rain will be
wet. But it's also a safe guess that those who hate boy bands will
greet this CD as if it were a compilation of Kenny G and John Tesh
performing the greatest hits of Wayne Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, those who hate boy bands are just as passionate
as those who love them. It doesn't matter if it's 'N Sync,
Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, LFO, or whichever manufactured group
some producer will unleash on the world soon. Ever since pop groups
populated with cute, crooning, camera-ready cover boys began
dominating the charts, MTV, and Top 40 radio a few years ago, most
music and cultural critics have outdone themselves in finding new
ways to denounce the heavily produced, packaged pop that makes the
little girls swoon. Entertainment Weekly has referred to such
groups as wimps, and derided the music as laden with ``slurpy
harmonies and puppy-dog songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, this message for all the critics _ get over it. They're
not for you.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that Louis Pearlman, the Orlando-based businessman
who created Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync (and was subsequently sued
by both groups) didn't put these bands together thinking about how
they would appeal to middle-aged men like himself. This was all
about the ladies, preferrably those under voting age, who will
always scream and shriek at the sight of pretty young men singing
silly love songs.
</P>
<P>
   So long as there are teenage girls with hormones and allowances,
there will be boy bands. Singing groups who don't play instruments
or write their own songs, whose pleasant faces and pearly smiles
are as important as their performing talents, have been around
forever. From the Four Freshmen to the Osmonds, from New Edition to
New Kids on the Block, boy bands have always been a part of popular
music. (One could even argue that the Sex Pistols, manufactured and
manipulated by entrepreneur Malcolm McLaren, were a boy band,
albeit one with much ruder songs and even worse personal hygeine.)
</P>
<P>
   Boy bands of various stripes have coexisted alongside the
Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Public Enemy, but never have their
bubble-gum harmonies been greeted with such derision as they are
these days. Perhaps, that's because so many have deluded themselves
into believing such groups are personally responsible for
hip-checking rock off the charts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, please. Somehow, I doubt that the same fans who were once
moshing to Smashing Pumpkins's ``Bullet with Butterfly Wings,'' are
now swooning to Backstreet Boys' ``Show Me the Meaning of Being
Lonely.'' Rock hasn't been undermined by boy bands as much as by
its own mediocrity, as evidenced by such wobbly recent albums as
Smashing Pumpkins's ``MACHINA/The Machines of God'' or Oasis's
``Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.'' Whatever their faults, at
least boy bands and their producers seem to understand what their
fans want, which is more than can be said for some rock groups who
are more interested in, at best, self-indulgence, and, at worse,
hackneyed songs that barely hint at what made the bands great in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So, let's all leave boy bands alone already. They're harmless.
Let them enjoy whatever time they have left, for we all know such
groups have notoriously short shelf lives. (NKOTB, anyone?) They'll
be gone soon enough as such groups usually fizzle by their third
album, when their fans are finally old enough to know better. At
least while they're around, we won't have to hear about their
pulling knives or guns on anyone, and their fans are unlikely to
pummel one another or go wildin' through a concert.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, regardless of how anyone feels about boy bands, I think
most would agree they'd prefer to have their daughters listening to
Backstreet Boys's ``I Want It That Way,'' or 'N Sync's ``Bye Bye
Bye'' than Juvenile's ``Back That Ass Up'' or Limp Bizkit's ``Break
Stuff.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the nation's capital and San Francisco may be known for
their cherry blossom festivals, Macon, Ga., claims to have more
beautiful Yoshino cherry trees than you can shake a stick at. More
than 236,000, to be exact. Macon's 18th annual Cherry Blossom
Festival is on through next Sunday with lots of events from parades
to ghost tours, a Japanese drum performance, and the Beach Boys.
For information, call 800-768-3400 (1).
</P>
<P>
   The annual Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival is both a
celebration of spring's arrival and of the rich Japanese culture
that is present in the San Francisco Bay area. The ancient samurai
were not only inspired by the blossoms in their poetry, but would
also willingly die in battle to defend their well being. It is out
of this passion that San Francisco's annual celebration was created
to honor the delicate flowers with viewing, parties, dance, song,
and sake. This year's festival will be held the weekends of April
8-9 and 15-16. The grand finale Cherry Blossom Parade will be held
April 16. For more information on the festival, call 415-563-2313

&HT;     3COM SELLING PARTS OF MODEM BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Remember Rockwell International Corp., U.S.
Robotics and Ascend Communications?
</P>
<P>
   These were the companies the 3Com Corp. bested in one of the
Internet's first guerrilla wars, waged over modem technology in the
mid-1990s. For years, those companies jockeyed for position in the
growing market, competing for the right to connect you to the
burgeoning Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, by most accounts, was 3Com, the Santa Clara-based
networking company. The victory was sealed in 1997 when 3Com
purchased rival U.S. Robotics for nearly $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the Internet landscape has changed
dramatically, and 3Com's victory has proved bittersweet for the
2,700 employees whose jobs will be transferred or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Monday that it was selling its dial-up
modem business, which has struggled amid falling prices, as well as
its PC card business, to a new company formed by Accton Technology
of Taiwan and NatSteel Electronics of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The moves will include laying off approximately 1,000 workers as
well as transferring approximately 1,700 current employees to the
new company, according to 3Com spokesman Mark Plungy.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, yet to be named, will be based in Mount
Prospect, Ill., where 3Com's current dial-up modem division is
centered.
</P>
<P>
   3Com employs 12,000 people in 48 countries. The company has
manufacturing plants in Ireland, Israel, Singapore, Santa Clara,
Foxboro, Mass., Chicago and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes as part of a larger restructuring at 3Com
that includes the company's plans to leave the high-end networking
business, conceding that market primarily to Cisco Systems Inc. of
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com announcement illustrates the blinding speed at which
the Internet, and the technology that drives it, is evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Shimer, vice president and general manager of 3Com's
residential connectivity group, acknowledged pointed out the upside
of buying U.S. Robotics three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accomplished a lot with the U.S. Robotics acquisition;
we've gained a presence in the consumer market, not only with the
modem but also with Palm,'' said Shimer, referring to the company's
Palm computing division, whose popular hand-held technology was
acquired in the U.S. Robotics deal and which was recently spun off
in a highly popular public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our question is focusing on the rapid growth in broadband,
with a focus on home networking,'' Shimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou vowed to take a closer
look at the company's businesses, hoping to stem market share
losses in the fields of networking and computer connector cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow us to do what we do best,'' said Bruce
Claflin, president and chief operating officer of 3Com. ``We are
going to focus on the things that will increase our shareholder
value.''
</P>
<P>
   That focus will come in the consumer and small to mid-size
business markets. 3Com, the top worldwide manufacturer of cable
modems, will continue to invest heavily in high-speed Internet
access through cable and DSL hardware. It also will provide the
necessary connectivity to Internet service providers and
businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For five years, the US-flagged American Canadian Caribbean Line
has made calls from Chicago on Great Lakes cruises. Increased
passenger demand for unique lakes adventure cruises has resulted in
the line adding a whole summer of cruises from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Planned are several seven-day Lake Michigan circumnavigation
cruises in addition to others departing, arriving, or continuing
from Chicago to the Atlantic coast or mid-America.
</P>
<P>
   ACCL's Niagara Prince is the only cruise ship that can pass
beneath Chicago's bridges, allowing it to connect the Great Lakes
to the Mississippi and mid-America. The line, America's original
small-ship cruise line, is based in Warren, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-passenger Niagara Prince has unique features like bow
landings, allowing passengers to disembark onto remote islands and
beaches along lake shores that other cruise ships cannot do. Its
shallow draft makes a spectacular Great Lakes itinerary even better
by getting into rivers and inlets to exotic places.

   Loyalty discounts &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A new and innovative guest loyalty program for travelers who
sail on the six lines belonging to World's Leading Cruise Lines _
Carnival, Holland America, Windstar, Seabourn, Cunard, and Costa _
is now available.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called Vacation Interchange Privileges, provides
the same discount benefits accorded to members of each line's past
program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, guests who sail on Seabourn, Windstar, or Cunard
will not only have access to discounts offered through past-guest
programs of the Seabourn Club, Windstar Foremast Club, and Cunard
World Club, but also savings available through any of the six WLCL
member lines' repeat-passenger programs. All the cruise line
members of the WLCL are owned by Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Savings of up to 50 percent are offered on select sailings of
Carnival, Costa, and Windstar. The discounts on Holland America are
up to 35 percent and those on Cunard, up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the discount, a traveler simply books a cruise through any
travel agent, who then informs the cruise line reservations agent
of the past-guest status at the time of bookings and, with the
initial deposit, supplies proof of the prior WLCL cruise. Other
restrictions may apply.
</P>
<P>
   The World's Leading Cruise Lines has a Web site, www.
</P>
<P>
   leaderships.com, that provides information and a gateway to the
Web sites of the participating lines.

OLDEST CITIES STILL HAVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Suppose you're just starting out in your working life, trying
to get your bearings. You wonder where to go to seek your fortune.
You want to go where the pinnacles are the highest, where the
ascent is most fierce.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the Los Angeles Times last week by Chicago's
Tribune Co. offers certain clues about the new geography of
American opinion-making.
</P>
<P>
   The most important nodes are New York, Chicago, and,
paradoxically, Los Angeles _ the largest city, the Second City and,
once again, the Third.
</P>
<P>
   The other American cities of international importance _
Washington D.C., Boston, Miami, San Francisco and, possibly,
Seattle _ are world centers in certain fields. But they do not rank
in the first tier of cities in which the formation of opinion takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   I should explain that I am using a highly subjective set of
yardsticks in which education, finance, and media industries carry
roughly equal weight, and the capacity to absorb the latest streams
of immigration counts heavily as well. This back-of-the-envelope
exercise is in the spirit of Jane Jacobs' notion of cities as
places where the real gains arise from diversity. It owes as much
to Michael Porter's characterization of cities by the clusters of
types of enterprises they contain.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that New York and Chicago remain on top at the
beginning of the 21st century. They are where the stock exchanges
and money markets are. Money, news, and fashion go together as a
rule.
</P>
<P>
   New York is obviously still the financial and cultural capital
of the United States _ perhaps the world. But only in the last few
years has it become a formidable power in Internet publishing,
though ``Silicon Alley'' constitutes only a thin slice of
Manhattan. Universities in its orbit _ Columbia, New York
University, and Yale _ have suffered since the late 1960s but once
again are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, in contrast, may be said to have been university-led.
Economic reformers from around the world trained at the University
of Chicago; Milton Friedman may be better known than Al Capone or
even Michael Jordan (in certain quarters). Its financial markets
rival those of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a glimpse into what enabled the Tribune Co. to make
it to the top, you need look no further than the resume of chief
executive John W. Madigan. He passed through the accounting firm of
Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co. and the investment banking firms of Paine
Webber, Jackson and Curtis, and Salomon Brothers on his way to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is the more surprising story. Its traditional
corporate establishment is in eclipse: Lockheed, Rockwell
International, and Unocal recently have been sold. And the
University of California at Los Angeles is a good university but
not great. But Los Angeles has unrivaled vitality and a lock on one
industry that ensures that the world will continue to share its
secrets. Los Angeles has the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is the anomaly here, since it is the seat of the
national government. But it is more acted upon then acting. The
Washington Post is the most distinguished private institution in
that town. There is little finance aside from government funders
and the local universities _ Georgetown, George Washington,
American and George Mason _ are still second-rate. Only the Johns
Hopkins University in nearby Baltimore is top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave Boston and San Francisco? Definitely
connected to the cities of the first tier and strong rivals in
certain respects. Both derive their power from world leadership in
science and technology. Strong educational and financial
institutions are the key.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and Seattle occupy similar niches, although their
respective bases are slimmer. Miami derives its importance from
being North America's portal to South America and the Caribbean.
Seattle has all the earmarks of a high-tech nursery, though it is
starting from far behind.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to rob a dozen other US cities of their
significance. Atlanta, Phoenix, Cincinnati, Denver, St. Louis,
Portland, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Detroit, to name an obvious few, are
thriving. But the hierarchy is well-established, and here, as in
Europe, the oldest cities tend to remain at the top.

'N SYNC: NO ZINGS ATTACHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fans. The fame. The sprawling game rooms in waterfront
homes. At a certain point in the brief lifespan of the teen idol,
all the fun of being a pop star is subsumed by the sudden desire
for credibility. It's a moment fraught with danger, not the least
of which is the likelihood that the idols will be revealed as
having no more artistic value to offer than blond curls, or zippy
dance moves, or sweet harmonies _ which is why he or she wound up
as a teen idol in the first place. This moment is, more often than
not, extremely unpleasant to witness.
</P>
<P>
   For 'N Sync, the existential crisis is coming down in textbook
fashion: on the heels of a 10 million-selling debut album (1997's
``'N Sync''), a holiday CD (1998's ``Home For Christmas''), and an
ugly legal battle to jettison its record company and
manager/inventor Louis Pearlman. The band succeeded in jumping ship
_ to former New Kids on the Block manager Johnny Wright and to Jive
Records, home of arch rivals the Backstreet Boys and Britney
Spears, and to their vision of themselves as mature, independent
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``No Strings Attached.'' Get it? The five young
men in 'N Sync would like the world to know they are not puppets.
No Svengali is jerking their chains, and no behemoth record label
is assigning them songs. They are doing a bit of composing and
coproducing. And that's not all. On ``No Strings Attached,'' 'N
Sync gives the kids in the 'hood a great big shout-out _ in the
cheesiest faux-black vocal mannerisms in recent memory _ that they
are in fact not nice boys at all, but rather nasty hip-hoppin'
party animals.
</P>
<P>
   So much for making girls weak in the knees and empty in the
wallet with wimpy love songs like ``I Want You Back'' and ``Tearin'
Up My Heart.'' The new album's first single, ``Bye Bye Bye,''
signals that the members of 'N Sync are now the sort of guys who
will be doing the dumping. And they back up their newly discovered
virility with some musical muscle-flexing, too. With its battalion
of synthesizers and hammering beats, ``Bye Bye Bye'' is certainly
'N Sync's stoutest song so far.
</P>
<P>
   Band member JC Chasez seems to be leading the charge; he cowrote
and coproduced four of the 12 tracks. On ``Digital Get Down,'' JC
raps in a bizarre, drawling growl about videophone sex. It's
jittery, stuttering, cut with hard grooves and popping dance-floor
beats. So is ``Space Cowboy (Yippie-Yi-Yay),'' which features a rap
by TLC's Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes. But the harder 'N Sync tries to
get down and dirty, the whiter and milder they sound. It's actually
painful listening to their careful enunciation of street vernacular
on ``It Makes Me Ill,'' helmed by A-list producer Se'kspere. On
``Bringin' Da Noise'' _ an offensively titled stab at
cred-by-association _ the boys deliver lines like ``Come on, come
on, let's raise the roof, and give 'em proof, that we can get
loose'' in a stiff croon. If only there had been a bouncer at the
studio door to bump these poseurs out of line before they had the
chance to drip all over the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   There are some satisfying songs, but the list isn't long. ``This
I Promise You'' penned by uber-balladeer Richard Marx, and ``I
Thought She Knew,'' an a capella paean to unspoken feelings, are
lovely. It's a testament to relativity: 'N Sync's ballads _ the
ones that require nothing more than holding five pretty notes and
proclaiming undying love _ sound just great compared to the
boatload of pretense that clutters the rest of ``No Strings
Attached.'' They're romantic fantasies drawn in the simple lines
and angelic melodies fancied by young girls. It's what 'N Sync does
best. It is, this album reveals, all 'N Sync does. They may be
pulling their own strings, but 'N Sync is still tethered to pop
mediocrity by the limits of their talent.

   (UNDATED) _ Millions of redundant computers and their highly
toxic components are storing up a huge hidden environmental problem
for Britain and America. If action is not taken soon, campaigners
say, the countries will have billions of pounds of contaminants in
their soils.
</P>
<P>
   Computers contain toxic heavy metals such as lead, cadmium,
mercury and chromium, all carcinogenic and not easily degraded.
</P>
<P>
   At present there is no system for dealing with such material,
and a pioneering European directive to tackle the problem is being
fought by the U.S. government and the electronics industry. It is
now more than a year behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The full scale of the potential pollution nightmare can be
judged from the U.S. experience.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental campaigners Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition
estimates that 315 million computers will have become ``e-junk'' in
the U.S. by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   These computers will contain 1.2 billion pounds of lead, two
million pounds of cadmium, and 400,000 pounds of mercury. In
addition there will be four billion pounds of
environmentally-unfriendly plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than three-quarters of all computers ever bought in the
U.S. are stored in people's homes because they don't know what to
do with them,'' said Ted Smith, the coalition's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone threw them out at once we would have a mile-high
waste mountain of junked computers the size of a football field.
There is a clear lack of information given to North American
consumers about recycling or disposal options for our obsolete
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth says the same thing is
happening in Britain. Experts estimate that more than 130,000 tons
of computer-related waste is thrown out each year, with only a
small percentage recycled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know that there are hazardous chemicals in
computers and do not realize they are building up an environment
problem for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs said. ``People do feel bad (sic) about putting such large
pieces of equipment in the rubbish but they do not know what to do
with them.''
</P>
<P>

   (UNDATED) _ Millions of redundant computers and their highly
toxic components are storing up a huge hidden environmental problem
for Britain and America. If action is not taken soon, campaigners
say, the countries will have billions of pounds of contaminants in
their soils.
</P>
<P>
   Computers contain toxic heavy metals such as lead, cadmium,
mercury and chromium, all carcinogenic and not easily degraded.
</P>
<P>
   At present there is no system for dealing with such material,
and a pioneering European directive to tackle the problem is being
fought by the U.S. government and the electronics industry. It is
now more than a year behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The full scale of the potential pollution nightmare can be
judged from the U.S. experience.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental campaigners Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition
estimates that 315 million computers will have become ``e-junk'' in
the U.S. by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   These computers will contain 1.2 billion pounds of lead, two
million pounds of cadmium, and 400,000 pounds of mercury. In
addition there will be four billion pounds of
environmentally-unfriendly plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than three-quarters of all computers ever bought in the
U.S. are stored in people's homes because they don't know what to
do with them,'' said Ted Smith, the coalition's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone threw them out at once we would have a mile-high
waste mountain of junked computers the size of a football field.
There is a clear lack of information given to North American
consumers about recycling or disposal options for our obsolete
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth says the same thing is
happening in Britain. Experts estimate that more than 130,000 tons
of computer-related waste is thrown out each year, with only a
small percentage recycled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know that there are hazardous chemicals in
computers and do not realize they are building up an environment
problem for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs said. ``People do feel bad (sic) about putting such large
pieces of equipment in the rubbish but they do not know what to do
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most domestic and many business computers end up in landfill
sites. Childs said: ``This is a huge pollution problem and waste of
potential resources. In the landfill sites there is the danger that
the heavy metals will leach into underground water.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     JOB SEEKERS, APPLICANTS NEED TO KEEP COURTESY IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People are often at their most vulnerable during
periods of uncertainty or rejection. Ask any job hunter. Sometimes
there will be hurt feelings no matter what you do, but it's awfully
easy to turn those feelings into anger and bitterness if you come
across as callous.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have been told for decades not to burn their bridges,
but employers need to realize that the advice is just as
significant for them. During the job-hunting and interview process,
both sides need to practice a little kindness if they don't want to
turn ardor into arson.
</P>
<P>
   Because of short staffing, heavy workloads and plain old
thoughtlessness, some employers just leave applicants dangling for
weeks after job interviews _ or never have the courtesy to call
them at all.
</P>
<P>
   If you interview people for a specific position and decide to
reject them, tell them as soon as possible. They shouldn't have to
hear it through the grapevine and you shouldn't let them wither
away in silence. That's just common sense and common decency.
</P>
<P>
   Even from a purely selfish point of view, those shortsighted
employers don't realize how much they can be sabotaging future
recruiting. They've alienated someone who at least was qualified
enough to make it to the interview process, and you can be sure the
disgruntled applicants will subtly spread the word about how they
were treated.
</P>
<P>
   Some may even vent over the Internet. On the vault.com Web site,
for example, there are employee-related bulletin boards for many
major companies, letting people give you the (sometimes distorted)
inside scoop on what it's like to work at those places.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are sensitive about delivering the bad
news, you reduce the potential animosity. If you treat applicants
fairly, most won't hold it against you just because you didn't pick
them.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have 10 finalists, and you tell them that you'll
make a decision by March 31. But your company's wheels grind more
slowly than expected and you find that you can't move until April
14.
</P>
<P>
   To you, that may be barely a blip in the work cycle, but look at
it from the applicant's perspective. ``It's April 7 _ one week
after they told me that they'd make a decision. Not a word. Should
I call them? Are they testing me? Could they have lost my resume?
Did somebody take a message and forget to give it to me? Have they
already made up their minds?''
</P>
<P>
   Job-hunting days are like dog years. They are seven times longer
than for normal humans.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the delay, the employer is faced with either making
10 phone calls (unlikely in these hectic times) or having 10
applicants get so anxious that they call you or so frustrated that
they write the whole thing off. You are adding stress to an already
stressful situation.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you finally do make a decision on April 14. Even if you
try to do everything right, some people won't get the word until at
least two weeks after you promised. That won't do much for your
company's reputation. It will do even less if you don't bother to
call at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough situation for employers, but not nearly as tough as
it used to be. Instead of sending a letter (too slow) or calling
all the candidates (sometimes too time-consuming), take advantage
of e-mail. Get a note out to everyone the same day you make the
hiring decision.
</P>
<P>
   If you get e-mail addresses from all the people you interview,
you can give them quick updates about delays and decisions as a
group, without spending a lot of your time doing it. An e-mail form
letter certainly isn't as warm and fuzzy as a personal phone call,
but it beats the heck out of some form letter sent two weeks later
_ or an eternity of deafening silence.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have time and want to offer encouragement, call
the best of the rejects and encourage them to stay in touch. Even
offer a constructive suggestion if you can. But make sure everyone
gets the word as soon as possible. Grapevines can work at amazing
speeds, and applicants will hold it against you if they get the bad
news through a third party.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an applicant, don't let a job interview end without
asking when a decision is expected. Ask if you can call if you
don't hear from the company by that date. And don't be afraid of
e-mailing the interviewer or any contacts you have within the
company; many busy people welcome e-mail because it's a fast way of
communicating without the concern of getting trapped into a
drawn-out conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Something to think about before you go in: It might be worth it
to put a little time pressure on the employer, saying that you have
another option you are considering. (That's no lie. There's always
another option _ even if it is unemployment.) That can help to get
some employers off the dime and make it appear that you are in
demand, but it can also backfire. Proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   If you interview with one company and then accept a job
elsewhere, tell the company that your application is being
withdrawn. If your potential bosses go through the whole process
and choose you, only to find out that you signed up with somebody
else two weeks ago, you'll be burning a bridge unnecessarily.

DYSFUNCTION RULES ON TV, AT HOME  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dysfunctional families are hot on television this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Fox, which is to dysfunctionality what Shakespeare was to
rhymed couplets, there's ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' ``King of the
Hill,'' ``The Simpsons,'' ``Family Guy'' and ``Titus.'' ``Married
... With Children'' has, sadly, been discontinued but, happily, can
still be seen in reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' broke new ground in
the genre in the sense that it actually created a real
dysfunctional family right there on (more or less) live TV. The
disappointment was that the couple split up almost immediately,
denying us, the viewers, the pleasure of watching their
dysfunctionality come to ``full flower'' by having kids and raising
them dysfunctionally and possibly, 20 years down the line, giving
rise to the sequel, Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire's Evil
Spawn?
</P>
<P>
   These shows have got to be confusing and maybe even a little
embarrassing to non-dysfunctional families who wonder why their
domestic situation is not like those portrayed on television.
Although they'd never admit it, even to themselves, what these
families want to know is how they can be dysfunctional, too.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has more than a little expertise in the subject,
allow me to say, first, that dysfunctionality is not something you
can achieve overnight. Some people may think that dysfunctionality
is just a fancy name for ``doing nothing'' but it really takes a
lot of dedication and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're on the subject, let's begin with a discussion of TV.
No. 1, there is no such thing as too many TVs. Try to have at least
on TV in every room in your house, including the bathrooms and
laundry room. Having a lot of TVs reduces the chances that two or
more family members will be in the same room watching the same TV
at the same time. (There was some chilling talk, early on, that the
show ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' had brought back to life,
vampire-like, the concept of ``family viewing.'' While it is true
that some otherwise dysfunctional families did watch the first few
shows together, the novelty quickly wore off, partly because of
Regis Philbin's grating personality and partly because of the
difficulty of the questions.)
</P>
<P>
   Mealtime is unquestionably the best time to watch TV. All meals,
including Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, are to be eaten in
front of the TV, preferably alone in one's room. If unforeseen
circumstances, such as a broken TV, result in two or more family
members watching TV in the same room, remember the cardinal rule:
Nothing you have to say is as important as what is being said on
TV. Some non-orthodox dysfunctional families permit talking during
the commercials, but I consider this a dangerous precedent. If you
let the kids tell you about their day during a commercial, the next
thing you know they are interrupting Drew Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Needless interruptions, of course, are not limited to children
whining about their high fevers. Since dysfunctional families watch
TV during all their free time (another advantage: dysfunctional
families have a lot more free time than non-dysfunctional
families), distractions are bound to occur. Before turning on the
set, it's a good idea to unplug the telephone and cut the wires to
the doorbell. Some families close their windows so they won't be
disturbed by chirping birds or rustling leaves, but I find that
this can be overcome simply to turning up the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Once you master the basics of doing nothing but watching TV and
never talking to one another, you'll find that the other elements
of the dysfunctional family quickly fall into place. The house will
start to fall apart. The yard will take on that wild, unkempt look
that one normally associates with Tarzan movies. An oil refinery
will be built next door and your property value will actually
increase. Jesse Ventura is elected president and your only worry is
that he will make fewer guest appearances on Saturday night
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   It is only when you have reached the Zen-like state of total
obliviousness that you can begin to think of yourself (and,
hopefully, the rest of your family) as dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens, always remember: Dysfunctionality is
not just a passing fad; it's a way of life.

security throughout the city, the protesters, carrying anti-U.S.
signs and chanting ``Bill Clinton, go home,'' marched about a mile
to the American Center, where they tried to break through police
barricades. Most of the protesters were affiliated with the
Communist Party India. Tuesday's protest was one of several that
have been held in New Delhi over the last few days. But the
protests have failed to deter a group of Indian community leaders
from across the United States, who traveled back to their homeland
to promote Indo-U.S. ties during Clinton's trip. ``The protesters
have a lack of understanding of the modern world and the free
enterprise system,'' said Atlantan Antony Thaliath, vice president
of the National Federation of Indian-American Associations. (Basu,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

two-thirds of the McCain vote, Luntz warns, the presumptive GOP

 &HT;    REAGAN'S DAUGHTER URGES MORE FUNDING FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH
 &HT;    Eds: Cox state information follows 5th graf.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Being a former president doesn't mean you won't get
Alzheimer's disease. And being a glamorous former first lady
doesn't mean you won't suffer the heartache and exhaustion of
caring for an Alzheimer's patient.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Maureen Reagan, daughter of former President
Reagan, brought a Senate panel Tuesday in urging lawmakers to boost
spending for Alzheimer's research by $100 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease is a thief that sneaks into the brain and robs a
family of everything that is dear to them,'' Reagan told the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and education. ``We
must be the last generation of American families to deal without
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan said her father, who turned 89 last month, ``is
wonderful, (but) the disease just gets worse.'' She said her father
``is comfortable'' with her, even though he does not recognize her.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's, a
degenerative disease of the brain associated with aging. It
afflicts about one in 10 persons aged 65 and about half of those
over 85. At present rates, the number of Alzheimer's patients will
double within 30 years and increase to 14 million by the middle of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Cox state information)
</P>
<P>
   Florida is expected to have the second highest number of
Alzheimer's patients by 2025, after California, an increase from
nearly 400,000 to about 713,000.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Alzheimer's patients in Colorado is expected to
more than double by 2025, from nearly 61,300 to about 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Alzheimer's patients in Georgia is expected to
nearly double by 2025, from roughly 103,000 to nearly 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is expected to have the sixth highest number of Alzheimer's
patients by 2025, an increase from more than 212,500 to about
308,600.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is expected to have the eighth highest number of
Alzheimer's patients by 2025, an increase from more than 132,000 to
about 253,000.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is expected to have the third highest number of
Alzheimer's patients by 2025, after California and Florida _ an
increase from nearly 281,000 to about 552,000.
</P>
<P>
   (End Cox state information)
</P>
<P>
   Such an increase will put enormous strains on the nation's
health care system, the Medicare program, and millions of families
called upon to care for their aging relatives, said Stephen
McConnell, vice president of the Alzheimer's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's costs the United States an estimated $100 billion a
year in medical costs and lost wages. In 30 years, that total could
exceed $375 billion a year, McConnell said. Delaying the onset of
Alzheimer's by five years could save an estimated $50 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare bears much of the federal cost of Alzheimer's disease.
Although Medicare does not pay for long-term care or prescription
drugs, studies have shown that Alzheimer's patients have additional
health problems that cost Medicare roughly $7,700 annually,
compared to $4,500 for non-Alzheimer's patients.
</P>
<P>
   Research offers the possibility not only of alleviating the
symptoms of Alzheimer's, but substantially delaying or even
preventing the onset of the disease in most people, said Dr. Steven
DeKosky, chairman of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of
the Alzheimer's Association.
</P>
<P>
   But DeKosky warned the panel that research projects take years
to conduct, and pursuing them in sequence would take too long to
offer promise to the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stack them end to end, we'll be in the middle of the
epidemic before we complete our research,'' DeKosky said.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, the
subcommittee's chairman and ranking Democrat, pledged to support a
$100 million boost in Alzheimer's research to $566 million. That's
$75 million more than President Clinton has asked for in his
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said lawmakers worried about Medicare's financial
security should support increased Alzheimer's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just postpone the onset of Alzheimer's by five
years, Medicare will be secure for the next 50 years,'' Harkin
said. ``If we can postpone the onset of Alzheimer's for 10 years,
Medicare will be safe for 100 years. If you want to save Medicare,
put your money in research for Alzheimer's disease.''

according to executive recruiters and people at companies that

Internet start-ups desperate to fill large numbers of openings,
openly acknowledge that they lack the time and resources to verify
all the information that job seekers submit. Even recruiters of
senior-level managers acknowledge that the frantic competition for
talent can blind them to danger signs. ``Now, if a bird flies, you
go for it,'' said Peter Crist, vice chairman of Korn/Ferry
International, the global executive-recruiting firm. ``What happens
is, in a high-velocity market like this, it becomes more
mistake-prone.'' By Charles Butler.

   EMERYVILLE, Calif. _ Ikea and its blond wood, affordable home
furnishings arrives in Northern California on April 12 with the
opening of a $46 million, 274,000-square-foot store in Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, Ikea is a really big furniture store with
some very cool stuff. But to its followers, it goes to a much
deeper place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a cult. I don't know what it is about it,'' said
Laura Knerler, a Novato resident who has taken trips down to
Southern California on the auspices of visiting friends, but
acknowledging the true draw was Ikea.
</P>
<P>
   Knerler was first introduced to the store in suburban
Pittsburgh, where her in-laws live: ``All of a sudden, going to
visit was a treat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emeryville store, the size of five football fields located
in a can't-miss location off Interstate 80 at the I-580 interchange
and painted in the can't-miss blue and yellow colors of the Swedish
flag, is expected to be wildly successful in this market.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, people in the San Francisco tend to respect the
stereotypical Swedish sensibilities of Volvos, massages and
unfailing political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   But to Ikea fans, none of this really matters. What matters is
the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, cheap, modern design stuff,'' said Denise Alvidrez,
25, of San Francisco. ``Out here, you can find a lot of witty,
clever products, but they're priced like witty, clever products.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvidrez has been limited to stocking up on all the Ikea items
she can fit into a suitcase when she visits her or her boyfriend's
families near Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a junkie. I can't wait until it opens,'' she said of the
Emeryville store. ``I'm getting these under-the-bed drawers I've
been eyeing for a year. They're nothing you can lug on a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ikeaites have been known to drive many hours to get to the
nearest store.
</P>
<P>
   When David Brix, a computer graphic designer-illustrator who
lives in Oakland, broke off a long-term relationship, he had to set
up his own apartment in a hurry. So he flew to Los Angeles,
borrowed a friend's truck and filled it with Ikea furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start from scratch,'' he said. ``I had no living
furniture, no dining room. I didn't have anything. It was the first
time I had my own place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ikea spokeswoman Marty Marston is at a bit of a loss to explain
why Ikea fuels such passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing quite like us. You can buy virtually anything
you need to live in a house, other than the appliances,'' she said,
``and we're somewhat hip.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of merchandise can only be compared with, say, a Sears
store. But the style is more like a Scandinavian Designs with a
little Crate &AMP; Barrel or Pottery Barn thrown in. The prices add a
touch of Target, a store that recently shot up on the hipster
meter.
</P>
<P>
   It has everything from kitchenware and lighting fixtures to
office furniture. Whimsical designs such as a lamp shaped like a
lightbulb to inflatable animal chairs set it apart.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ikea able to sell a solid-wood twin-frame bed for $79
or a kitchen cabinetry set (including the cabinet, countertop and
handles) for $645 is that everything is flat-packed and sold
unassembled (except upholstery products).
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is you do a little, we do a little and together we
say a lot,'' said Michael O'Rourke, manager of the Emeryville
store, which will be the country's third largest Ikea store,
eclipsed only by those in Chicago and Elizabeth, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at efficiencies on the factory floor and that, in
turn, leads to a lot of innovations in what we produce,'' O'Rourke
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the Emeryville Ikea is the company's first store in
Northern California, the opening is expected to draw huge crowds
(the company is bringing in 100 employees from other stores to help
in the opening rush).
</P>
<P>
   George Rosenbaum, chief executive of Leo J. Shapiro &AMP;
Associates, a Chicago-based market research firm specializing in
retail, said Ikea encourages this fanatical following.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of this great merchant entrepreneur coming out of
the deep, black forests of Scandinavia with affordable,
do-it-yourself furniture in styles and designs that will make your
life comfortable while meeting the approval of friends and family
is kind of seductive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since a store cannot survive on fanaticism alone, Rosenbaum said
Ikea manages to draw $60 million to $70 million in sales per store
in a year by becoming the ``Volkswagen of furniture stores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco will be a very good market for Ikea,'' he said.
``A lot of people pay so much for housing they have no money left
for furniture. Yet they want nice quality stuff. Ikea is a good
solution.''

   AFRICA'S AIDS ORPHANS: In sub-Saharan Africa, 23.3 million
people _ most of them women _ are infected with HIV/AIDS, compared
with less than 1 million in North America. Efforts to stop the
disease's progress have been largely futile. Few Africans can
afford treatments more readily available in the West, such as AZT.
The disease is destroying entire villages, but beyond that it is
robbing these countries of a whole generation of potentially
productive people. It has created more than 10 million orphans _ a
number that is expected to soar to 13 million next year.

   AFRICA'S AIDS ORPHANS: In sub-Saharan Africa, 23.3 million
people _ most of them women _ are infected with HIV/AIDS, compared
with less than 1 million in North America. Efforts to stop the
disease's progress have been largely futile. Few Africans can
afford treatments more readily available in the West, such as AZT.
The disease is destroying entire villages, but beyond that it is
robbing these countries of a whole generation of potentially
productive people. It has created more than 10 million orphans _ a
number that is expected to soar to 13 million next year.

   KOLOMNA _ Workers at Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters in
Kolomna are so confident of success in the Russian presidential
election that they do not even have a picture of their candidate on
the wall. Nor are the acting president's supporters campaigning
house-to-house.
</P>
<P>
   Kolomna was once Ivan the Terrible's favorite town: As a boy he
used to walk on stilts around its fortified kremlin, overlooking
the waterlogged meadows where the Moskva and Oka Rivers meet.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday voters here, two hours drive south of the capital, go
to the polls in an election which most accept _ though without much
enthusiasm _ will make Putin the next Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a grey personality with huge ambition, but he doesn't
really know what to do,'' said Denis Philippov, 25, a local
journalist who will not vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he will tighten the screws on the media, but I don't
think he will be able to crack down on the oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   Such outright skepticism is a minority view. In Kolomna, whose
160,000 inhabitants have been badly hit by the collapse of its
machine building and locomotive factories, Putin is seen as the man
who will clean up the mess left by President Boris Yeltsin.
Although how exactly he will do that is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of heavy industry in the town should be fertile
ground for Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party, the only
candidate apart from Putin to have support in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The number employed at the locomotive works has fallen from
20,000 to 8,000 in the last 10 years those left earn about $80 a
week.
</P>
<P>
   But even Lev Sornikov, 68, a retired teacher who is secretary of
the local Communist Party, admits that ``Putin has an appeal when
people compare him with Yeltsin. People used to compare Gorbachev
with Brezhnev in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya is the key to Putin's image as a strong,
decisive leader. Sornikov likes the way Putin ``didn't yield to
pressure from NATO over Chechnya.'' ``Higher casualties won't make
Putin unpopular,'' he said. An officer from Kolomna killed in
Chechnya was being buried as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Philippov agrees. He said: ``The majority here support the
war. Xenophobia has grown very much in Kolomna in the last seven
months. People who used to be friendly to Caucasians now want to
strangle them.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the change to unrelenting anti-Chechen propaganda
on state-controlled television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has almost all the political cards in his hands here.
Alexei Tkachov, a Putin campaigner, boasts that his candidate ``has
turned down free air time on television, because work comes
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But as television gives wall-to-wall coverage of all his
activities, Putin does not need to campaign in the traditional
sense.
</P>
<P>
   With few concrete policies, Putin has managed to convince most
voters that he represents a break with what they see as the ruinous
and corrupt economic reforms of the Yeltsin era and the
authoritarianism of the Soviet Union. &QL;

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although some of my best friends have them, I've
never been much of a cat fan.
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of exceptions, their ancient, inscrutable charms
are nearly always lost on me. Where others see an exotic and
mysterious aloofness _ ``They're descended from lions; they won't
be OWNED!'' _ I see a selfish, ungrateful, narcissistic pain in the
butt.
</P>
<P>
   I know this attitude is pedestrian and lacking in soul (I have
been told it is pedestrian and lacking in soul), but give me a
tail-wagging, jump-up-on-you, slurpy-tongued dog anytime.
</P>
<P>
   A cat comes and rubs up against you when it wants something to
eat or is bored and has no other option. If your dog had its way,
you two would be joined at the hip.
</P>
<P>
   A dog wants to be with you just because you exist. Toss in a few
luxuries like regular food, petting and playing fetch with a tennis
ball, and you see where that ``man's best friend'' stuff comes
from.
</P>
<P>
   Also ``dog'' is ``god'' spelled backwards, something I don't
think is a coincidence. Dog, god. Anyway you spell it, it means
unconditional love.
</P>
<P>
   I've been ruminating on all this because my neighborhood has
gotten lousy with cats.
</P>
<P>
   Not the skinny, skittish feral kind that skulk around for food,
then scurry away to their version of a homeless person's cardboard
box under a freeway.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about privileged and pampered cats, the kind with
collars (though rarely ID tags) and well-tended fur. Cats with
homes from which they roam. And roam and roam and roam.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they roam?
</P>
<P>
   Into my back yard and onto my deck. Or, when (silly me) I open
my French doors to let in light and air, they roam into my home.
</P>
<P>
   As of the most recent count, I have lost three flower pots to
the privileged cats that roam from home. One pot, a white ceramic
bucket with blue and green flowers, had been with me since 1981 and
had survived three moves and an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   But what is sentimental value to a cat?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the main transfer point for all north-south
and east-west cat traffic, my deck has become the feline Club Med
of the neighborhood. It is the place everybody heads to loll in the
sun, scratch their claws on wood and _ yum, yum _ conceive
hairballs by licking themselves all over.
</P>
<P>
   In no time at all, the hairball babies gestate, grow and get
delivered (in all their slimy glory) back onto the deck or down in
the yard in my flower beds. Often, they are deposited right next to
another little clump of waste that comes from kitty's opposite end.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the fights.
</P>
<P>
   Both combatants screech and keen. The sound of bodies slamming
against wood fills the air, something I especially appreciate at 3
a.m. Fur literally flies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, my only weapon is a garden hose, which I use when I
happen to be home and not dead asleep, to break up the brawls.
</P>
<P>
   (One of my cat-keeping neighbors actually endeared himself to me
a few weeks ago when he shouted across the fence: ``That cat in the
back is mine; aim your hose at him!'')
</P>
<P>
   But I don't like the violent and vengeful way I feel with my
water hose gun in hand. I hate that I love to see the cats freeze,
then rocket away in fear of their lives. It disturbs me that I
thoroughly enjoy blasting the little bastards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you get a big dog?'' several friends have asked.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason is because I'm not home enough to be a good
dog owner. Unconditional love or no, I don't believe it's fair to
leave your best friend unattended for 10 or 12 hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a dog should be free to run around its own yard. So
much for my flower beds and rose bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could always fight fire with fire,'' one pal suggested.
``Get your own cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about unclear on the concept. I'd rather fight fire with a
fire hose.
</P>

December by a fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing an
almost inevitable chance of being elected in Russia's popular vote
March 26. So, then, is Putin just what the Russian doctor ordered?

both in his short career as a political leader and in his longer
career as a spy, have been scary...By The Economist &QL;

most of whose working life has been spent with the KGB, is no
exception. Does he come to power with the bottled-up energies of a
hitherto frustrated reformer, determined to take Russia into
Europe? Or does his heart lie in the paranoid, ruthless old world
of the Cold-War Soviet security services? Or is he in reality a
Kremlin insider, a crafty new-Russian power-broker who revels in
sleaze and arm-twisting? Any one of these three faces could be the
real Putin, the other two just political disguises...By The

<P>
   ``Then Came You'' boasts a premise so thin it makes Calista
Flockhart look chunky. It concerns a young (33-year-old) career
woman (Susan Floyd) who gets divorced, checks into a hotel and
begins a fling with a guy (Thomas Newton) fresh out of college. The
fling lasts, and lasts, and lasts ... .
</P>
<P>
   All the zany turmoil that can result from such an alliance _
they have different income levels and don't get each other's
pop-culture references _ is dealt with in tonight's episode. Future
episodes grasp desperately at plot lines so stock they haven't been
seriously used since the `60s or so, and play out so synthetically
and formulaically they seem to come from another planet. To wit:
The moony twosome fret over what gifts to get one another; a date
to her friend's wedding is imperiled because he's recruited to work
at it _ and can't find one human being on the entire planet to
switch shifts with so he won't embarrass her. !ital!Please.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there's nothing going on here. Physically, the age
difference _ that is the whole point of the series _ is a moot
point: Floyd doesn't look appreciably older than Newton, let alone
significantly older. (On the other hand, there's a lot of effort to
surround her with friends and colleagues that wring her of her
youthfulness, trying to make her artificially seem at least 40
mentally and spiritually.) And the comedy is virtually
non-existent, too.
</P>
<P>
   This was originally intended to premiere back in September, but
was pulled back at the last second; nonetheless, it's utterly
emblematic of everything that people have complained is wrong with
sitcoms this season.
</P>

   Creator Betsy Thomas based this series on her own life. Thomas
married her younger man. The fate of that relationship will be
happier than that of ``Then Came You.'' &QL;

&HT;     MEMORIAL INSCRIPTION DIVIDES JAPANESE-AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By YURIKO NAGANO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A short inscription proposed for the National
Japanese American Memorial in Washington, D.C., is reopening
half-century-old wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The words, written by a Japanese-American man who died in 1991,
are generating hundreds of letters from Japanese-Americans to
federal authorities in a last-minute effort to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute is prompted not so much by the inscription
itself as by the author and the organization he stood for.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese-Americans who were interned in camps during World
War II say that Mike M. Masaoka, who led the Japanese-American
Citizens League (JACL) during the war, did not accurately represent
their views.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame Masaoka and the JACL to this day, saying it leaked
information that led to thousands of arrests and incarceration of
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very close with Mike,'' said Clifford Uyeda, an
83-year-old San Franciscan and former JACL president. ``He was a
man of extreme ego. I don't think there's a need for any type of
inscription (by him) on the monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka grew up in Utah. Because he did not live on the West
Coast, he was not interned in the Japanese-American camps.
</P>
<P>
   Cedrick M. Shimo of Los Angeles, 80, has made donations to the
memorial, but doesn't want Masaoka's name chiseled on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Masaoka understood the Nikkei position,'' said
Shimo, using the term to describe the four generations of people of
Japanese ancestry in America. ``He spoke like a white man. If he
lived on the West Coast, I don't think he'd be thinking like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Yamamoto and Chris Iijima, law professors at the University
of Hawaii at Manoa, asserted in a letter to federal officials that
Masaoka had shaky credentials as a leader for Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that he proposed a `suicide battalion' of
Japanese-Americans be formed whose loyalty (to the United States)
would be assured by family and friends being held by the (U.S.)
government,'' they said, referring to the Japanese-American
battalion that was sent to fight in Europe during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Masaoka pitched an idea to the U.S. government that
Japanese-Americans be branded, stamped and used as cheap labor in
the sugar beet fields, they added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masaoka failed to support the first Japanese-American redress
legislation, introduced in 1979, and initially opposed individual
monetary redress for Japanese-Americans,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   John Parsons, an associate regional director at the National
Park Service in Washington, said that final approval had not been
given for the inscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a couple hundred letters,'' he said. ``The
letters are very emotional, personal and well-written. Very
articulate. Very well studied. Researched. Very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said he was reviewing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to drag on for months, because the memorial is
already under construction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, being built a couple blocks north of the Capitol,
is scheduled to be completed in November. More than $7 million was
raised by the nonprofit National Japanese American Memorial
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Masaoka's inscription would be quotes by
Japanese-American politicians such as Norman Mineta, Robert Matsui
and Daniel Inouye. Other features include cranes, bells, a list of
Japanese-American internment camps and the names of 800
Japanese-American veterans who died in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka's quote is part of a long statement adopted by the JACL
called the ``Japanese-American Creed,'' written in 1940 for a
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed excerpt reads: ``I am proud that I am an American
of Japanese ancestry. I believe in her institutions, ideals and
traditions; I glory in her heritage; I boast of her history; I
trust in her future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The section they quote is so ambiguous,'' said Bill Hohri, 72,
a former internee. Masaoka ``talks about `her this' and `her that'
and you just sit there and think this could refer to Japan. That
gives me the exact opposite feeling. The whole issue of the creed
hits everybody that has been to the camps right in the gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Tsutsumida, executive director of the memorial
foundation, said the group tried to gather public input, drawing
about 1,000 people to nine national and regional meetings in cities
such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But foundation board member Rita Takahashi of Berkeley said the
meetings were not actually public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few people were invited to come to these events,'' she
said. ``Nothing was ever opened up to the community so the whole
community could respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Bill Hosokawa, 85, also a wartime internee, has
voted in favor of Masaoka's inscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can make everybody happy,'' he said. ``What
Mike Masaoka said was the sentiment of the time. There are many
people today who endorse what Masaoka said.''

MUSIC RUNS THROUGH HIS VEINS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through ``American Beauty,'' the troubled teen Ricky, who
seems to videotape all his experiences, asks his new friend Jane if
she wants to see the most beautiful thing he's ever filmed. They
(and we) sit for the next three minutes or so watching a video of a
white plastic bag swirling in the wind. It is an oddly mesmerizing
experience as the bag soars and falls, taking off in unexpected
directions, graceful yet violent all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like what comes out of an orchestra when they're just
tuning up (more) than when they're playing my music,'' says Thomas
Newman. ``Because they're just doing something _ noodling ... It
embodies the unprotective element of the creative spirit. I enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film composer laughs after saying it, asking if I'll clean
up that quote, sounding a little unsure if he got his point across.
He did, but Newman could also be talking about the flight of a bag,
how something so ordinary can surprise us.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Newman has spent some time thinking about that bag. He
wrote the Academy Award-nominated score for ``American Beauty,''
and the theme for that scene _ a succession of simple piano notes
and chords _ against slowly played strings.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a composer in demand, ``American Beauty'' is Newman's
fifth Oscar nomination. He also scored another current
Oscar-nominated film, ``The Green Mile,'' as well as current
box-office champ ``Erin Brockovich.'' And while all these projects
present different challenges, Newman says he tries not to approach
a film with ``any preconception with how it should be solved
musically. It limits my ability to be surprised by accidents and
whimsical ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the score of ``American Beauty,'' you hear echoes
of other Newman works _ ``The Player,'' ``Unstrung Heroes,''
``Oscar and Lucinda'' _ with their rhythmic elements. Newman, who
professes an affinity for 20th-century American composers such as
Charles Ives, gives credit to director Sam Mendes for wanting to
``percuss'' the film, but ``I agreed in default.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening theme in the film _ the memorable ``Dead Already'' _
sets the tone. Using marimba and xylophone _ mallet instruments _
it begins with five syncopated notes, which repeat, then grow as
instrumentation is added. While other elements are introduced, it
is the original five notes that are hammered home, so to speak,
producing an emotional response that seems to take you in a number
of different directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about `American Beauty' is how ambiguous
it is tonally, where it lands and how surprised you are by being
moved by it and equally how surprised you are by being hit with a
loopy kind of ridiculousness,'' says the 44-year-old composer. ``So
the real challenge was how to walk the fence of many kinds of tonal
areas and not sacrifice any of the ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   Loopy. Whimsical. Words that seem to define Newman's taste in
instrumentation, too _ tablas, kim-kim drums, bird calls, dulcimer,
lap steel guitar, banjo, ukulele, tin whistle, detuned mandolin and
saz (a lute-like Greek instrument) _ on ``American Beauty.'' Sounds
more like ingredients for a weird world hootenanny.
</P>
<P>
   But while Newman admits his tastes are eclectic, ``I don't want
to go to world music. I find and collect various instruments. My
friends and I like to improvise on and hit on as a way of finding
our creative places.''
</P>
<P>
   That does sound a bit like a jam session, but Newman's
background is anything but improvisational. He is the youngest son
of Alfred Newman (who died when Thomas was 14), the legendary film
composer who won nine Oscars from an amazing 45 nominations. His
brother, David, is another film composer (``Galaxy Quest,''
``Bowfinger''). His uncle Lionel, was also a composer who headed
20th Century Fox's music department for many years. And
singer/songwriter/film composer Randy Newman is his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Hollywood Hills are alive with the sound of Newmans. In
Thomas' case, it's actually Pacific Palisades where he has his
studio, in the same home he grew up in. So while Oscar nominations
are ho-hum for the Newmans, they're not for Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, I'm changing a diaper on my son and I
go, 'Wow! I've been nominated.'''
</P>
<P>
   But while music was everywhere when he was a kid, he wasn't
inclined to go into the family business. After getting his master's
degree in musical composition from Yale, opportunities naturally
seemed to come his way, including a chance to orchestrate Darth
Vader's death scene in ``Return of the Jedi.'' Newman says there
wasn't much to do because the score, by family friend John
Williams, was so complete. Williams is also up for an Oscar for
``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Newman has relished working with some of Hollywood's
most creative directors _ Robert Altman, Steven Soderberg, Gillian
Armstrong, Frank Darabont and, of course, Mendes _ which lets him
loose in his own creativity.
</P>
<P>
   A bad score, says Newman, is not always the composer's fault.
Some filmmakers are insecure about getting their point across.
Mendes, he says, was interested in bringing out the best in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best directors, in a way, know how to step back
and be a member of an audience,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the ``American Beauty'' scene, Newman was careful to
step back himself, watching the flight and rhythm of the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to allow the music to walk through the scene without
being intrusive,'' says Newman. The result is a perfect melding of
image and sound _ and a perfect melding of Newman's classical
compositional style and his improvisational impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that part of the human spirit that takes you where it
takes you,'' Newman says about improvisation. ``You let it lead
you, as opposed to you leading it. I'm fascinated by that.''!end!

   ENGLISH-PUDDINGS (Mickleton, England) _ For American kids,
pudding means the gloppy, yummy stuff, usually chocolate or
butterscotch, that comes out of a cardboard box. In Britain,
though, a fabulous array of soft, warm, sweet puddings _ so many
that a resourceful Mum could easily turn out a different one every
day of the month _ light up childhood mealtimes and linger
reassuringly decades later in the memories of 50-somethings and
60-somethings. They are the quintessential nursery food, comforting
to both body and spirit, and you will find them on the menus of
proletarian pubs and elitist clubs alike. Like American
steakhouses, English puddings have been undergoing a renaissance of
late. ``The rib-stickers especially,'' said Simon Hopkinson, a
leading English chef and food writer, ``are back in fashion in a
big way.'' By R.W. Apple Jr.

before Clark Gable, before Bobby Sherman, even before Jonathan Mink

prototype more appropriate to a Jewish girl, meat kreplach, which
my grandmother fried and served with applesauce. But growing up in

   KOLOMNA _ Workers at Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters in
Kolomna are so confident of success in the Russian presidential
election that they do not even have a picture of their candidate on
the wall. Nor are the acting president's supporters campaigning
house-to-house.
</P>
<P>
   Kolomna was once Ivan the Terrible's favorite town: As a boy he
used to walk on stilts around its fortified kremlin, overlooking
the waterlogged meadows where the Moskva and Oka Rivers meet.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday voters here, two hours drive south of the capital, go
to the polls in an election which most accept _ though without much
enthusiasm _ will make Putin the next Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a grey personality with huge ambition, but he doesn't
really know what to do,'' said Denis Philippov, 25, a local
journalist who will not vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he will tighten the screws on the media, but I don't
think he will be able to crack down on the oligarchs.''

<P>
   Such outright skepticism is a minority view. In Kolomna, whose
160,000 inhabitants have been badly hit by the collapse of its
machine building and locomotive factories, Putin is seen as the man
who will clean up the mess left by President Boris Yeltsin.
Although how exactly he will do that is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of heavy industry in the town should be fertile
ground for Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party, the only
candidate apart from Putin to have support in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The number employed at the locomotive works has fallen from
20,000 to 8,000 in the last 10 years those left earn about $80 a
week.
</P>
<P>
   But even Lev Sornikov, 68, a retired teacher who is secretary of
the local Communist Party, admits that ``Putin has an appeal when
people compare him with Yeltsin. People used to compare Gorbachev
with Brezhnev in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya is the key to Putin's image as a strong,
decisive leader. Sornikov likes the way Putin ``didn't yield to
pressure from NATO over Chechnya.'' ``Higher casualties won't make
Putin unpopular,'' he said. An officer from Kolomna killed in
Chechnya was being buried as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Philippov agrees. He said: ``The majority here support the
war. Xenophobia has grown very much in Kolomna in the last seven
months. People who used to be friendly to Caucasians now want to
strangle them.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the change to unrelenting anti-Chechen propaganda
on state-controlled television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has almost all the political cards in his hands here.
Alexei Tkachov, a Putin campaigner, boasts that his candidate ``has
turned down free air time on television, because work comes
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But as television gives wall-to-wall coverage of all his
activities, Putin does not need to campaign in the traditional
sense.
</P>
<P>
   With few concrete policies, Putin has managed to convince most
voters that he represents a break with what they see as the ruinous
and corrupt economic reforms of the Yeltsin era and the
authoritarianism of the Soviet Union. &QL;

   KOLOMNA _ Workers at Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters in
Kolomna are so confident of success in the Russian presidential
election that they do not even have a picture of their candidate on
the wall. Nor are the acting president's supporters campaigning
house-to-house.
</P>
<P>
   Kolomna was once Ivan the Terrible's favorite town: As a boy he
used to walk on stilts around its fortified kremlin, overlooking
the waterlogged meadows where the Moskva and Oka Rivers meet.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday voters here, two hours drive south of the capital, go
to the polls in an election which most accept _ though without much
enthusiasm _ will make Putin the next Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a grey personality with huge ambition, but he doesn't
really know what to do,'' said Denis Philippov, 25, a local
journalist who will not vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he will tighten the screws on the media, but I don't
think he will be able to crack down on the oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   Such outright skepticism is a minority view. In Kolomna, whose
160,000 inhabitants have been badly hit by the collapse of its
machine building and locomotive factories, Putin is seen as the man

MASSACRE OF SIKHS IN KASHMIR COINCIDES WITH CLINTON VISIT TO

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The first day of President Clinton's visit to
India Tuesday was haunted by a horrific atrocity committed Monday
night in Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan territory that is at the
nub of half a century of conflict between India and Pakistan _ one
that the Americans fear could be a nuclear flashpoint between them.
</P>
<P>
   Just after dinnertime Monday, a band of armed men entered two
neighboring Sikh villages, summoned the male residents from their
mud huts and small brick homes, then slaughtered 39 of them in a
hail of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the massacre, the first
ever committed against the minority Sikhs in the past decade of
fighting in Kashmir. But both India and the militant groups that
have been battling in Kashmir say they assume the attack was timed
to coincide with the first visit by a U.S. president to India in 22
years on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has said he hoped he could help ease tensions over
Kashmir by visiting both India and Pakistan, condemned the attack,
while cautioning that it will be hard to draw any conclusions about
it until the identity of the killers is known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly share your outrage and heartbreak over last
night's brutal attack in Kashmir,'' he said Tuesday at a joint
press conference with India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, this latest twist in the cycle of violence has the
Indians pointing an accusing finger at Pakistan _ and the Islamic
militant groups Pakistan supports in Kashmir _ while Pakistan
denies complicity and the militant groups charge Indian security
forces with committing the massacre to discredit them in the eyes
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to police and residents of the small Sikh village of
Chati Singhpura, a band of armed men, dressed in Indian army
uniforms, entered their village and the adjacent village of Karewa
Singhpur at about 9 Monday night. The army put the number of gunmen
at about 20, while the police in Srinagar estimated a posse of 40.
</P>
<P>
   The male residents of the villages, which are about 40 miles
south of the summer capital of Srinagar, were asked to step outside
their homes. They filed out unsuspectingly. Sikhs had never before
been targets of violence in the years that predominantly Hindu
India has battled a Pakistan-backed insurgency in predominantly
Muslim Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said that a tall, polite man who identified himself as
the commanding officer assured the villagers that all they needed
to do was show their identification cards, a process that would
take just 10 or 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed they were security men searching for militants,''
said one of the villagers, Surinder Kour.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the gunmen opened fire, killing 35 villagers on the
spot. Four more died later of their wounds. ``They were shot at
point blank range, said Ashok Bhan, inspector general of police in
the Kashmir zone.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the village was a pitiable scene. Women and
children, sobbing and beating their chests, gathered round the
bullet-pocked bodies of their menfolk, scattered and askew near the
Sikh temple.
</P>
<P>
   Angry and sorrowful, the villagers on Tuesday did not seem sure
whom to blame. Some accused the Indian army, others suspected the
militants, and still others said they simply did not know who had
done it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brajesh Mishra, national security adviser to India's prime
minister, said Tuesday that India had evidence that two militant
groups _ Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hezbul Mujahedeen _ had jointly
carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``These outfits are supported by the government of Pakistan,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee and his home minister, Lal Krishna Advani, painted the
attack as part of strategy planned by Islamic militants engaged in
a holy war against India to ethnically cleanse Kashmir of other
faiths. They first targeted Hindus and have now moved on to Sikhs,
Advani said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee also depicted it as part of a concerted effort to
undermine any movement toward peace and stability in South Asia
generally and Kashmir in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deliberate design to foment trouble, to encourage
killings, mass murders, to sabotage any attempt to bring about
normalcy in this part of the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials condemned the attack and denied any part in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would very much like a very thorough inquiry or
investigation to be conducted into this incident so that it is not
exploited for purposes of propaganda in order to deflect attention
from the Indian repression in Kashmir,'' Pakistan's foreign
minister, Abdul Sattar, told reporters in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Hezbul Mujahedeen also denied any
involvement in the attack. ``It is a deliberate attempt by the
Indian secret agency by which it wants to tarnish the 55-year
freedom movement as a terrorist movement,'' said Sayed Salahuddin,
the group's leader, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they had no independent evidence of who
killed the Sikh men. Tuesday morning, when the Indian and U.S.
delegations met, the Indians seemed to know little and had not been
shown any additional evidence later in the day, the Americans said.

   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton arrived in New Delhi Monday
to start a tour of the Indian subcontinent, presented in Washington
as the opening of a new chapter in diplomacy and trade. Seen in the
context of Washington's overture to Iran at the end of last week,
the president's week-long trip appears not just as an attempt to
address years of neglect, but as part of a much wider shift in U.S.

<P>
   Anti-Semitism, which is no stranger to skinheads or
intellectuals, has found a subtler breeding ground. It has gained
respectability within the intellectual elite involved in Dead Sea
Scroll research and biblical criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In an attack on Judaism and the Bible, some Dead Sea Scroll
scholars have used the Temple Scroll to suggest that Jews took a
direct hand in the crucifixion of Jesus, thus reopening an old
wound that the Roman Catholic Church has sought to close in recent
years. These scholars have asserted in recent years that the Temple
Scroll should become the sixth book of Moses and a new book of the
Bible, equal to the Torah, the foundation of all Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Although many questions still swirl around the true age of the
Dead Sea Scrolls and who produced them, mainline scroll scholars
say most of the biblical texts and commentaries were written in
pre-Christian times and hidden in caves in about 68 AD where they
lay untouched until 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The Temple Scroll, so named because it speaks of rebuilding the
Jewish temple in Jerusalem, reportedly was found in the 11th
scroll-bearing cave overlooking the Dead Sea in 1956. But it didn't
surface until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Israeli soldiers
liberated it from a Palestinian dealer who had been keeping it in a
shoe box under the floor of his home in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer was later paid $105,000 for what turned out to be the
largest of the Dead Sea Scrolls, measuring 26 feet long and 9 to 10
inches high in its original form.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing part of the text of the Temple Scroll, some
scholars have taken the Hebrew verb ``to hang'' and have claimed
the word actually denotes crucifixion, despite contrary statements
from such leading Hebraists as Joseph Baumgarten of Baltimore
Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   One of these scholars wrote in the Journal of Jewish Studies
that Jews borrowed the practice of crucifixion from the Romans, and
``naturalized'' it into Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Another took the next step, reviving the old libel that the Jews
killed Jesus. He wrote that crucifixion in Judaism of the first
century (BC) could be regarded as a ``divine commandment'' and as a
legal penalty for high treason and blasphemy. ``One can no longer
argue that the fact of Jesus' crucifixion excludes Jewish
participation in his trial and death....'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Baumgarten, who is a member of the current Dead Sea Scroll team,
flatly states that the word in question does not mean ``to
crucify.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Baumgarten, the former graduate chairman of religious
studies at Boston University, Howard Kee, agreed that the Hebrew
means ``to hang,'' or ``to suspend'' but does not mean ``to
crucify.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took issue with those scholars who say Jews adopted
crucifixion from the Romans and made it part of their law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that the Jews practiced crucifixion at
the time of Christ,'' Kee said.
</P>
<P>
   According to biblical and rabbinic law, the only Jewish means of
execution were stoning, burning, decapitation, and strangulation --
not crucifixion, which was a Roman method.
</P>
<P>
   Scroll scholars do not dispute that the Romans crucified Jesus,
yet by the mistranslation of the Temple Scroll, Jews again are made
culpable for his death, not just by consent, but by method as well.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing this new attack on Jews and Judaism, Jewish scholars
scoffed at the suggestion that crucifixion was a divine
commandment, regarding it as historical fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Breitbart, senior researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, said in an interview: ``One, Jewish courts
never crucified. Two, Jewish courts many years before (the death of
Jesus) lost their power to inflict capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few accounts of hanging from before the Roman
conquest of Palestine, but, Breitbart said, ``when the hanging from
a rope was done, it was done after the death of the guilty party
... to display justice, not at all as a method of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``So shame on them (the scholars) for their lack of
scholarship,'' he said. ``Or, if they knew this, shame on them for
perpetrating an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Many biblical critics loathe the Bible, which shows up in their
animus toward Jesus, Jewry and the State of Israel. Since their
discovery in 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls have become a major weapon
in such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hershel Shanks, in ``Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls,''
states, ``For years the issue of anti-Semitism has lurked beneath
the surface of the Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   The virulent anti-Semitic views of John Strugnell, former head
of the scrolls team, were revealed in a 1990 interview with an
Israeli correspondent in which he referred to Judaism as ``a
horrible religion'' and said ``the occupation of Jerusalem -- and
maybe of the whole state (of Israel) -- is founded on a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those statements, Strugnell was allowed to stay on the
team, though not as its leader.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Price, in his expose, ``Secrets of the Dead Sea
Scrolls,'' revealed that the views of a number of other scroll
scholars were also anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members of the original Scroll Team had anti-Semitic
sentiments and openly aligned themselves with the Arab cause even
after the 1967 Six-Day War,'' Price wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Examples of this anti-Semitism,'' he wrote, ``include Patrick
Skehan's refusal to publish his completed volume in the DJD
(Discoveries in the Judean Desert) series of scroll photos under
Israeli auspices. Price also notes ``Roland deVaux's decision to
discontinue as the leading Scroll Archaeologist his work at the
Ecole Biblique in protest of `Israel occupation.' At the time,
these attitudes temporarily shut down work on the Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Price's revelations, Yitzchok Adlerstein, director
of the Jewish Studies Institute of the Yeshiva of Los Angeles,
said, ``Dead Sea Scroll studies in particular show bias of epic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Jaworowski, chairman of classical studies at Villanova
University, commented in a 1993 letter concerning Dead Sea Scroll
studies that there are ``indeed serious issues at stake here of
anti-Semitism and anti-Christianity, not to mention valid
scholarship and personal and professional integrity.''
``Unfortunately,'' he continued, ``I agree that until the scrolls
can be turned over to a more legitimate board whose intentions are
beyond question, we'll never know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Anti-Defamation League is weighing in. Emily Greytak,
assistant director of the Philadelphia ADL, has prepared a report
after a month-and-a-half long investigation based on this article
and other documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reviewed this material and are forwarding it to our
national Office on Interreligious Affairs,'' she said in a Dec. 9,
1999 letter. ``We are confident that they will be handled
appropriately by our ADL colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Given the bias of many liberal scholars, is it any wonder that
Jews were barred from the scroll team until 1985? Or that Israel's
right to exist was in question?
</P>
<P>
   While conservative evangelical scholars saw the rebirth of
Israel as the beginning fulfillment of many biblical prophecies,
many liberal biblical scholars expressed disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity also came under direct attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days (of Scroll research,) much of the
controversy involved the extent to which Christianity would be `cut
down to size' by the contents of the scrolls,'' Shanks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   John Allegro, one of the original eight members of the Scroll
team, is quoted in Shanks' book as telling a colleague, ``By the
time I've finished there won't be any Church left.''
</P>
<P>
   Price further tells us, ``John Allegro, the agnostic, spent the
rest of his life trying to find ways to subvert the Christian
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to this day, scholars use the scrolls to discredit the
Bible and the validity of Judaism and Christianity.

CONDOMS ADDED TO LIST OF SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander has managed
to find a tax cut that Gov. George W. Bush, a fellow Republican,
probably won't brag about:
</P>
<P>
   Starting April 1, Texans will pay no sales tax on condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Prophylactics, which can be used to prevent pregnancy and
venereal disease, were included by the state's chief financial
officer among over-the-counter health items in Bush's 1999
initiative to give Texas families a break on some of life's
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, never wanted
condoms included in the package. In fact, when he proposed the tax
cut during his 1998 re-election campaign, he stated that it would
not apply to sex-related items and birth control products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comptroller decided to include those products that the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration certifies as having a medicinal,
treatment or preventative effect on disease and illness,''
explained Sheila Clancy, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's
office. ``And condoms have been proven effective for preventing
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman reiterated on Monday that the governor had no
intention of including condoms among sales-tax exemptions, but
would go along with Rylander's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like a bureaucratic, technical thing,'' said Mike
Jones of the governor's media office. ``Apparently the FDA has
found that these products have health benefits, and our law
basically uses the FDA's guidelines. I'm not an expert on what the
FDA calls medicine, but we'll follow the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Adams, president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum,
said equating condoms with cough syrup and antacids is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised, and very disappointed'' by the ruling, Adams
said. ``We are more concerned about protecting children than we are
about protecting those who would promote promiscuity. And that's
what those products do.''
</P>
<P>
   But others applauded the move as an appropriate one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about public health policy at this point,''
said Peggy Romberg of the Texas Family Planning Association. ``It
seems to me that it would be inconsistent with good public health
policy to separate out those products which are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV, hepatitis and other diseases. That's
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Other exempt items include over-the-counter products for
allergies, nausea, hemorrhoids, rheumatism, asthma, colds, sunburn,
constipation, headaches and dandruff; anti-microbial products;
antiperspirants (but not products labeled ``deodorant'');
anti-vomiting products and vomiting inducements; blood fortifiers;
medicated dental products; ear care and eye care items; sedatives
and sleep aids; stimulants; vitamins; minerals; and wound treatment
products.

BRITISH LABOR UNIONS TO PROTEST JOB LOSSES FROM BMW'S SALE OF
ROVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An increasingly bitter dispute between Germany and
Britain over BMW's sale of the money-losing Rover Group threatened
to spill onto the streets when British labor unions Tuesday called
a huge demonstration on April 1 to protest thousands of expected
job losses from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement coincided with remarks by a senior German
official that Britain's reputation as a haven for foreign
investment could be jeopardized by the government's criticism of
BMW's keeping secret the talks that led to the sale agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-year investment, BMW announced last week that it was
selling Rover's main car production plant at Longbridge near
Birmingham to Alchemy Partners, a British investment group. BMW
also said it would sell Rover's profitable Land Rover sport utility
vehicle division to Ford Motor Co. for $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy said it planned to phase out Rover cars _ one of the
last British mass-market nameplates _ and focus on new models
bearing the MG name.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the BMW-Alchemy deal have not been disclosed, but
executives close to the talks said the investment group was likely
to pay up to $80 million for a debt-free balance-sheet worth more
than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The British government and labor unions have appealed for
alternative offers that would safeguard jobs. Under the present
deal, thousands of the 9,000 jobs at the rambling Longbridge plant
would be lost as it is transformed into a niche car producer. The
job losses would be likely to extend into smaller supply companies
in Britain's West Midlands automaking region.
</P>
<P>
   John Hemmings, a wealthy e-commerce and Internet businessman
with political ambitions in the region, said he was trying to
assemble a consortium to make a counterbid. But, he said, ``it will
be very difficult to get anything together'' because of Alchemy's
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In trading in Frankfurt on Tuesday, BMW rose 3.75 percent on
speculation that the Munich-based company could be vulnerable to a
takeover by Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors. But Thomas Gauly,
a spokesman for the Quandt family of Germany, BMW's dominant
shareholder, dismissed the speculation. He also denied a report in
a German news magazine that Joachim Milberg, BMW's chief executive,
was about to be replaced because of the involvement with Rover.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Blair was
furious that BMW had not consulted his government in the talks,
echoing similar displeasure in Germany when Britain's Vodafone
AirTouch began a hostile bid for Germany's Mannesmann late last
year. BMW responded by criticizing Britain for allowing the pound
to rise so high against the mark that it made Rovers too expensive
to sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   British unions, meanwhile, are calling for a boycott of BMW
cars, and anti-German sentiment is filling the mass-circulation
news media. On BBC radio Tuesday, Germany's ambassador in Britain,
Hans Friedrich von Ploetz, warned that Britain's reaction to the
deal could ruin its reputation as a magnet for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, Britain's trade and industry minister, who has
accused BMW of lying about Rover, plans talks with BMW in Munich on
Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Woodley, the chief negotiator for the Transport and General
Workers Union, who has also held talks with BMW executives, said
Tuesday that labor organizers had had a very favorable response to
their call for a protest march on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no exaggeration to say that this campaign is now a
battle for Britain and British manufacturing,'' he said, ``and it
has struck a chord with the British people.'' &QL;

   In another ``upbeat'' Holocaust movie, a Polish restaurateur
(Robin Williams) decides he'll cheer up his fellow concentration
camp inmates by pretending he has a radio and is hearing news of
imminent liberation. That gives Williams a chance to do his Winston
Churchill imitation, but it also opens the floodgates for a rush of
strained good spirits that rob the tale of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In this Holocaust story, an Anne Frank look-alike (Hannah Taylor
Gordon) may just live happily ever after. And, Janet Maslin wrote
in The New York Times, ``the film anticipates all laughter and

&HT;     NO REASON TO TOAST FRENCH DRINKING HABITS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HILARY ABRAMSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _ If Americans need one-size-fits-all
drinking advice based on the so-called ``French Paradox,'' how
about telling the truth? Drink like the French, die like the
French.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the news: The world's largest study of heart disease
reveals that, most likely, French heart disease statistics used for
that CBS report nearly 10 years ago were underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the World Health Organization during the
past decade in 21 countries with 10 million men and women, is
motivating French scientists to come forward and confirm the scary
side of French drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of alcohol and health, which has become a cornerstone
of marketing wine in America, is on the federal agenda. Between
April and August, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will
hold five public meetings throughout the nation to hear testimony
before deciding whether a wine industry label on health effects
should be legalized.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the bureau is expected to decide policy on using
health claims in advertising alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that alcohol is a prescription for health stems from
the famous ``60 Minutes'' segment on the ``French Paradox.'' It
offered the conclusion that wine (red wine in particular) must be
the reason the French can eat a suicidal diet of saturated fat,
often in conjunction with heavy smoking, but have fewer deaths than
expected from heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fathers of the ``French Paradox'' now believes the
time has come to ban the expression his research team coined in the
mid 1980s. Another of his countrymen, whose work helped make the
``French Paradox'' a household term, says that attributing a low
rate of heart disease to daily consumption of wine or other forms
of alcohol is wrong. If alcohol is involved, it is only one of many
complex diet and lifestyle explanations.
</P>
<P>
   While heart disease may be less pervasive in France than in many
other countries, it is still the nation's No. 1 cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, the CBS story single-handedly rescued a
faltering U.S. wine industry and embedded in the American
consciousness the notion that moderate drinking lowers heart
disease risk. Within a month, the sale of red wine increased by 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Wine Institute seized the ``French
Paradox'' and ran with it. Over the next few years, the institute
lobbied officials of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. The wine people wanted the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to
reflect studies apparently confirming the ``60 Minutes'' report.
The industry could then use these official guidelines in an attempt
to market wine as a health elixir.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several winery promoters persuaded the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to permit a label suggesting that
people write the U.S. Department of Agriculture to learn more about
the health effects of drinking alcohol. Anyone who actually sent
for the document would discover that the government's advice on
alcohol is mostly cautionary.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., whose daughter was killed by a
drunken driver, became inflamed by the belief that the wine
industry was using the health-effects label to make it appear that
the government was suggesting Americans drink for their health. He
won a battle with the bureau to hold the hearings this spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Institute touts its product today on its Web site with
studies and press releases.
</P>
<P>
   One quotes David Pittman, a researcher at Washington University
in St. Louis: ``In societies such as France, Italy, Spain and
Portugal, where wine and overall alcohol consumption is higher than
in the United States, they just don't have as many alcohol-related
problems such as drunk driving and underage drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be news to France.
</P>
<P>
   The world view that the French are able to control their
drinking habits is untrue, according to Pierre Kopp, professor of
economics at the Sorbonne. Kopp estimates that alcohol costs France
$18.5 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   The French drink one-and-a-half times more per capita than
Americans. Their death rate from liver cirrhosis is more than
one-and-a-half times greater than that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 43,000 French people die each year from alcohol-related
causes. That's the proportional equivalent of 200,000 Americans, or
double the number who currently die annually of alcohol-related
causes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   French drinking is decidedly unromantic to French health
experts. Until there is scientific consensus on alcohol and health,
we should ban any label suggesting such a connection.
</P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Of effluence and affluence
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ We're having a big stink about our paper mill,
more so than normally.
</P>
<P>
   The mill is asking state regulators to allow more leeway in its
discharge of effluent into the creek that leads into the Angelina
River that feeds Lake Sam Rayburn.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who worry about the environment are opposed to what
they consider an undue amount of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The paper mill, however, says its scientific studies show the
concern is unwarranted. Most of our civic leaders _ a busload
traveled to Austin this week to support the mill at hearings _
point to the company payroll as a mainstay in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   What would we do, they say, without the paper mill?
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me. It was already here when I was born.
</P>
<P>
   Folks back then weren't bothered so much about the environment.
The smell of the paper mill, they used to say, was the smell of
money.
</P>
<P>
   A writer for Harper's magazine, who got lost and somehow ended
up here for a night or two, described it somewhat differently in an
article in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Rotten egg puke, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As I recall the magazine article, he told an old-timer he was
talking with, ``If I lived here, I'd blow that place up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' the local replied. ``If you lived here, you'd work
there.''
</P>
<P>
   I worked there myself, in an indirect way, as did most everybody
in town.
</P>
<P>
   The paycheck I drew as a cub reporter at the newspaper came from
the same folks who owned the paper mill, and most everything else
in town _ the TV station, the biggest bank, the sawmill and any
number of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember anybody ever telling us we couldn't use the
word ``pollution'' in the newspaper. But we didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the paper mill has changed ownership more than once
since then, as have the newspaper, TV station, banks and any number
of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The sawmill, by the way, closed.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine that folks used to ask: What would we ever do
without the sawmill?
</P>
<P>
   No reason to think that'll happen with the paper mill. There's a
$230 million modernization plan in the works, assuming the state
OKs more lenient environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you know what modernization means _ more machinery,
less people. But what jobs are eliminated, the company says, will
be mostly through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the mill effluent can't be all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, years ago, the PR guy who conducted plant tours
would drink a cup of the stuff being discharged into the creek, all
but smacking his lips, to demonstrate for visitors how safe it was.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, too, that a young man on one of the tours with his
college group lingered behind the others and, before anyone could
stop him, took a big swig of it himself.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, the paper mill ended up hiring a private
detective to shadow the student around campus for a number of
weeks, just to make sure there were no delayed, ill effects. Last
anybody knew, he was doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to the paper mill, whence our blessings flow. Drink up,
everybody.

   MEAT-RAVIOLI (New York) _ It may have been my first love _
before Clark Gable, before Bobby Sherman, even before Jonathan Mink
in the second grade. Meat ravioli. My fixation began with a
prototype more appropriate to a Jewish girl, meat kreplach, which
my grandmother fried and served with applesauce. But growing up in
the era of checkered tablecloth Italian restaurants, I soon
established a pattern of gluttony by ordering _ and finishing _ two
portions of meat ravioli from the children's menu. By Alex Witchel.

TAIWAN RECOVERS AFTER ELECTION TURMOIL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Defying analysts who predicted that the victory
of the opposition leader in Taiwan's presidential election would
scare off investors, the stock market here roared back on Tuesday.
Taipei's exchange jumped 5.5 percent, more than making up for its
2.6 percent loss on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders were comforted that the victory of the opposition
leader, Chen Shui-bian, did not noticeably ratchet up tension
between Taiwan and China, despite strident warnings from Beijing
about Chen's past advocacy of Taiwanese independence. And while the
defeated Nationalist Party was still in turmoil, the violent street
protests that followed the vote also subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen has come out with a number of conciliatory statements
toward China,'' said Peter Kurz, the director of research at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Like most analysts, Kurz had predicted that the market would
plunge by its daily limit of 3.5 percent for several days before
hitting bottom. Fears of a crash grew on Sunday, when angry members
of the Nationalist Party besieged its headquarters in central
Taipei, demanding the resignation of the party's chairman,
President Lee Teng-hui, for his role in the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, hours before the market opened, Minister of
Finance Paul Chiu cut the limit on single-day price declines to 3.5
percent, from 7 percent. But on Tuesday, as Taipei basked under
glorious blue skies rare for this time of the year, those fears
seemed wholly unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three issues that were worrying people _ a victory by
Chen, reprisals by China, and the collapse of the ruling party _
all settled down,'' Kurz said.
</P>
<P>
   In another soothing gesture, Taiwan's parliament approved direct
trade links between three outlying islands and mainland China. The
move is largely symbolic, since fishing boats and fruit vendors
from the islands _ Quemoy, Matsu, and Penghu _ already travel
freely to and from the mainland. But it added to the perception
that Taiwan and China were not hurtling toward a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, Chen has
battled the perception that he is less friendly to business than
the long-ruling Nationalist Party. That stems from his party's
roots as an opposition movement which drew its support from outside
the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several analysts predicted Chen would work hard to win over
business people, and might be more accommodating in some areas than
Lee. Apart from Tuesday's gesture, Lee has refused to allow direct
trade, transportation, or communications links between Taiwan and
China. He has also imposed strict limits on investment in the
mainland by Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech on Saturday, Chen said he was willing to
lift those restrictions and negotiate direct links, provided it can
be done without compromising Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanding trade is mutually beneficial,'' said Chen Pi-chao, a
former national security adviser to Lee who is now advising Chen.
``If we or they try to use trade to score points, it's not in the
best interest of either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's new leader has tried to woo foreign investors by
pledging to accelerate the lifting of restrictions on foreign
ownership here. Chen said he would allow outsiders to own 100
percent of local companies by June rather than by the end of the
year as had been earlier contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's economy played only a peripheral role in the campaign,
which was dominated by issues with China and charges of corruption
in politics. Chen's campaign manager, Chiou I-jen, acknowledged on
Monday that the incoming administration lacked experts on the
economy. He said Chen was assembling a task force of scholars and
other experts to help formulate policies.
</P>
<P>
   But with Taiwan rebounding briskly from the Asian economic
crisis, Chiou suggested that President-elect Chen had no plans for
radical changes. ``The situation of Taiwan's economy is fine,'' he
said, adding that even firms with ties to the Nationalist Party
``will want to continue investing in Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here noted that although Chen himself is a prosperous
lawyer who has represented some of Taiwan's largest corporations.
Several captains of industry endorsed Chen in the final week of the
campaign -- votes of confidence that proved crucial in swaying
voters who might have harbored doubts about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old impression was that Chen was anti-business,'' said
Paul Hsu, a leading corporate lawyer. ``But now the businessmen are
powerful enough that Chen needs them more than they need Chen.''

SOME ANSWERS TO PESTICIDE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Readers often send me questions that are of interest
to more than an audience of one, and lately they have almost all
involved fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   One reader was anxious about the pesticides in strawberries, and
whether cooking the fruit reduced any risk. I checked the most
recent ranking of produce by the Environmental Working Group, a
nonprofit research organization in Washington. The rankings reflect
the number of pesticides in various fruits and vegetables, and the
percentage of each category that is cantaminated with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Apples were at the top, followed by spinach, peaches, pears,
strawberries, Chilean grapes, potatoes, red raspberries, celery and
green beans.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether cooking reduces the levels of pesticide in a
fruit or vegetable, it depends on the type of fruit or vegetable
and on how long it is cooked. Turning apples into applesauce or
tomatoes into tomato paste reduces levels significantly. Freezing
produce has virtually no impact.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wondered if peeling vegetables reduced the
pesticide level. Generally, peeling fruits and vegetables will
reduce the level, but some pesticides are systemic and taken up
through the roots.
</P>
<P>
   Readers interested in more data on pesticides in food can log on
to the Web site of the Environmental Working Group, which is at
www.foodnews.org. For those who are truly concerned about
pesticides in conventional food, the safest alternative is organic
food.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, a reader wondered about the nutritional value
of vegetables in soup, explaining that her husband called soup
``dead vegetables'' because they are cooked so long. Water-soluble
vitamins B and C do leach out of vegetables when they are cooked in
liquid, but in this case they go directly into the soup.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the vegetables from looking dead, add the most tender
ones just long enough to cook and contribute some flavor without
turning to mush.
</P>
<P>
   Still another reader wanted to know how pineapple juice and
carrot juice can still have fiber in them after they have been
processed. The best source of that kind of information is Harold
McGee, the author of ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   As he explains, there are two kinds of fiber, soluble and
insoluble. Pectin, which is used to gel jellies, is soluble fiber.
It doesn't appear to have any texture, but it does, so you might
not be able to tell it was in the juice. Cellulose and lignin are
insoluble fibers. The fiber in a glass of pineapple or carrot juice
is soluble, and it cannot be seen because it is suspended in the
liquid. Insoluble fiber, if it is there, is the sediment, what
eventually falls to the bottom of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader had a more pressing question: Can you make a
low-fat blue cheese dressing like the bottled kind at home?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. You can make a low-fat blue cheese dressing, but not
like the one in the bottle. In my version, which is given below,
there is no guar gum, used as a thickener.
</P>
<P>
   Because blue cheese has such a strong flavor, not much is
needed, and that keeps the calories and fat down. This dressing is
delicious on ripe tomatoes or Belgian endive and as an alternative
to the usual dressing for coleslaw or potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   To make enough for four people, mash two ounces (four
tablespoons) of blue cheese with six tablespoons of plain nonfat
yogurt, two tablespoons of brandy and a couple of pinches of
cayenne. Mix well. The dressing will keep for a week or two in the
refrigerator, tightly covered.

IN OREGON, PINOT GRIS TAKES ON A NEW IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is a grape with an identity crisis: In France it
is known as pinot gris, except in Alsace, the French region where
the grape reaches its zenith and is called tokay. In Italy, it is
pinot grigio, a straight enough translation, but in Valais, a Swiss
wine-growing region between France and Italy, it is known as
malvoisie. Other aliases are auxerrois gris, rulander and
szurkebarat.
</P>
<P>
   Turning this grape into wine does little to simplify matters.
Italy's pinot grigio is most often light, crisp and inoffensive,
while Alsace's tokay can be floral, rich and highly aromatic.
</P>
<P>
   On this side of the Atlantic, though, there is an opportunity
for clarity. Winemakers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon have
adopted this grape over the last decade. Not only have they all
agreed to use its French name, pinot gris, but they have achieved a
stylistic consensus as well, carving out a middle ground between
Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon pinot gris is dry, light-bodied and lightly fruity, with
an occasional toasty quality and sometimes even a hint of fizz to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot gris from Oregon rarely costs more than $15 a bottle, and
in a heartening display of enlightenment, winemakers are
emphasizing the qualities that make the wine likable, rather than
trying to turn it into something big and expensive. Still, some
Oregon winemakers cannot resist the urge to make pinot gris into a
sort of junior chardonnay by flavoring it overwhelmingly with oak.
</P>
<P>
   Such wines, including a couple I tasted, are like children
dressed up for a beauty pageant. You don't admire the child, you
just wonder about the parents.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the exceptions. These wines, listed in order of
preference, are fresh and attractive, all good spring and summer
choices. And since these Willamette Valley winemakers did such a
good job of solving the pinot gris identity crisis, let's do the
same for them: the valley is pronounced will-LAM-it. &QL;

APPLES WITH A RICH SURPRISE: FOIE GRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fourth of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef at Lespinasse in Manhattan. They are being written
with Melissa Clark.)  
 (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By CHRISTIAN DELOUVRIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The combination of foie gras and apples has always
had a powerful appeal to me. I even used to serve a foie gras
``burger'' in which the fruit acted as the bun for the meat. It was
more than a culinary conceit: the sweet and tangy apple set off the
rich and fatty duck liver to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   These days I'm putting those two partners together again in a
new marriage that's more traditional but just as extraordinary. The
foie gras is still seared so it has a great crisp edge, but the
apples are more like a throne than a bun.
</P>
<P>
   Roasted apples and foie gras are a very old Perigord dish, a
reminder of my childhood near Toulouse and the boudin noir, or
spicy blood sausage, we ate with sauteed apples. Foie gras has the
same saltiness and certainly the same richness.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the dish is simple and unadorned: the apples are
roasted in duck fat until they practically fall apart, then halved
and stuffed with seared foie gras and baked again.
</P>
<P>
   My variation is more refined. I start with Gala apples, which
have a beautiful color and shape, and bake them until they are only
slightly softened. I fill them with a puree of roasted Golden
Delicious apples, my favorites for their honeyed, slightly floral
taste.
</P>
<P>
   The foie gras sits on that bed, and tiny cubes of Granny Smith
apples in a sauce with dried sour cherries finish the dish, along
with a tart cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I also use two kinds of vinegar to balance the sweetness and
richness of the dish. Cider vinegar adds a jolt of flavor; sherry
vinegar brings up the flavor of the little saute of Granny Smith
cubes.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I consider this dish a celebration of apples, its
heart is the seared foie gras. I use a whole lobe, trimmed and cut
into thick slices. Don't be afraid to pull it apart to remove the
unsightly large veins. Foie gras is forgiving, and you can pat it
back into shape if it's slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The pan for searing it also must be very, very hot to get the
crisp edge. And the slices should be cooked only a minute or so;
the longer you cook them, the more fat they will lose and the
smaller they will become. And they should be more than just a
garnish for these luxurious baked apples. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED APPLES WITH SAUTEED FOIE GRAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup frozen cranberries
</P>
<P>
   \ cup plus 5 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 Grade A duck foie gras (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   8 Golden Delicious apples, cored
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons melted butter
</P>
<P>
   8 Gala apples
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into \-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped dried cherries
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cider vinegar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine cranberries and \ cup sugar in a small pan. Cook,
stirring and mashing, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool; then puree in a
blender or food processor. Strain, pressing on solids. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Rinse foie gras and pat dry. Using a small sharp knife, trim
away large veins and membranes. Cut foie gras crosswise into 8
slices about 1{ inches thick. Refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange Golden Delicious apples
in a baking pan and drizzle each with { tablespoon butter and {
teaspoon sugar. Bake until very soft, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool; then
peel apples and puree. Strain and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. While Golden Delicious bake, prepare Galas. Slice off just
enough of bottoms so apples can stand upright. Slice 1 inch off
tops; then use a melon baller to hollow out tops and centers,
reserving flesh, leaving a \-inch border. Brush apples and tops
with 2 tablespoons melted butter. Return apple flesh to apples to
help them keep their shape, and replace tops. Bake until tender but
not mushy, about 20 minutes. Discard apple flesh. Cover shells and
tops with foil to keep warm. Leave oven on.
</P>
<P>
   5. Salt and pepper foie gras slices on both sides. Place a large
ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add foie gras and cook until well
browned but still firm in center, 30 seconds a side. Transfer to
oven and bake 1 minute, until center is soft.
</P>
<P>
   6. Put remaining butter in a small skillet. Add Granny Smith
cubes, cherries and remaining sugar and saute 2 minutes. Add sherry
vinegar and cook until evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Reheat apple puree in a small saucepan. Fill each apple shell
with puree. Stir cider vinegar into remaining puree, and spoon
about 1{ tablespoons in center of 8 plates. Stand apple shells in
puree and lay a slice of foie gras in each apple; spoon a bit of
apple-cherry mixture over foie gras. Place tops on apples at an
angle to expose foie gras. Drizzle cranberry sauce around plate and
serve.

</P>
<P>
   This was not the story with Sonic the Hedgehog.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic's death was all about guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The night I came home and found my son's pet dead, lying on his
side with his mouth half-filled with some loose shavings from his
cage, I cried. It was 9 at night, and I had just gotten home from
the office. I was tired, and the kids were at their dad's for the
night.
</P>
<P>
   I sat at the dining room table for two hours, drinking three
glasses of pinot noir and reusing the same pathetic tissue.
Finally, I picked up the phone and called a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonic's dead,'' I sniffed, which brought the anxious reponse
of ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonic. Jack's hedgehog,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said, finally. ``I didn't know you cared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just it,'' I said, keenly irritated with his density.
``I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   I did care about Sonic once. And so did my son. When we first
got our little exotic pet four years ago, Jack took him out each
day to play with him, just as the pet-store owner had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   As the months passed, Sonic overcame his natural tendency to be
scared of humans and would unfold himself from the prickly hissing
ball that was his defense position. Sonic would run around the
floor in front of Jack. While it wasn't exactly playing, it was
entertaining. They both seemed so happy.
</P>
<P>
   When Sonic was about a year old, I noticed his spines were
beginning to fall out and his skin looked rough and red. I found
him a specialty vet _ two cities away _ who told me Sonic had
mites. Every day, twice a day for a month, I coaxed Sonic out of
his hissing ball and somehow compelled him to swallow a drop of
medicine. I Florence Nightengaled him back to health. I was happy.
</P>
<P>
   That was light-years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I cried when Sonic died because I didn't know what to do with
the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Throw it in the trash? It wouldn't get picked up for four days.
Bury it in the back yard? What if the neighboring cat dug the thing
up? And what was I going to tell the kids the next day when they
came back home?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I hit upon an answer: the vet across the street. The
clinic opened early. I'd take Sonic there. I put Sonic's cage in
the garage and slept well that night, not knowing what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The vet rushed to the door to help me with the cumbersome cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have we here?'' he asked with a wide grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said, ``I'm afraid it's a dead hedgehog.'' I waited
nervously for him to ask how I had the nerve to dump this horrid
problem squarely on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the good doctor looked sad. He opened the cage and with
his bare hands, began stroking Sonic's face, exposing a nasty
infection on his ear I hadn't noticed before. I began to feel like
a pet abuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor baby,'' he murmured. ``Poor, poor thing.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to look sad, too, but I felt nothing. Except guilt. I
knew Sonic had been losing weight. I knew he had been dehydrated. I
knew he was disoriented because he began running on his wheel in
the daytime instead of at 3 in the morning as was his usual
behavior. I explained all this to the vet. What I couldn't explain
was why I hadn't done a thing.
</P>
<P>
   To cover my shame, I stammered something about how I just wanted
this taken care of before the kids got home from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aah, there's children,'' he said. He touched my arm in
sympathy. ``Please, wait here.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling increasingly uncomfortable (I am a horrible, horrible
animal-neglecting person with no feelings whatsoever), I watched
while the vet rummaged through cabinets. Finally, he handed me the
literature he sought: ``Death of the Family Pet: Losing a Family
Friend'' the cover read.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I guess you'll want this cage back for your next pet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Next pet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, that's OK,'' I said, looking at the cage and noting with
sudden shock that the still-afixed price tag read $70. How
different life was back before I was divorced, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' the vet nodded, not understanding at all. And
how could he? He was a saint. I was the fallen, clearly beyond
rehabilitation. I had to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll clean this out right now,'' he said, misinterpreting my
anxiety and offering comfort that could only make me feel worse.
``And then I'll call around to some local schools. I'm sure there's
a classroom that could use this for their pet.''
Epilogue &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When I told the kids about Sonic's death the next day, Jack had
tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Sweetie,'' I said, thinking that this was all my
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all my fault,'' said Jack. ``Do you understand, Mom? I
just feel so guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   This I understood. And reprobate that I am, I could offer real
comfort to my son.

 &HT;    ADAM'S MARK HOTEL CHAIN SETTLES TWO DISCRIMINATION LAWSUITS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Adam's Mark hotel chain has agreed to pay $8
million and implement non-discrimination policies to settle two
lawsuits, Attorney General Janet Reno announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's mark admitted no wrongdoing in an agreement ending a
class-action lawsuit filed by private plaintiffs and joined by the
state of Florida, but will pay $4.4 million to African American
guests and visitors at the chain's Daytona Beach hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The case began after five African American college students said
the hotel them _ but not white guests _ wear bright orange
wristbands to get into the hotel during last spring's Black College
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark will also pay $1.5 million to four historically
black colleges in Florida for scholarships and internships in hotel
and hospitality management. It also agreed to pay $112,000 to the
four schools _ Florida A&AMP;M University, Bethune-Cookman College,
Edward Waters College and Florida Memorial College _ to coordinate
and promote the annual Black College Reunion over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Another $1.75 million will go for attorney fees, and about
$250,000 to administer the payments to members of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five students who brought the original suit will get
$25,000. Another 1,200 guests and an undetermined numbers of their
visitors will also share in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate suit, the Justice Department alleged that the
chain violated the Civil Rights Act by charging black customers
higher prices than whites and segregating them in less desirable
rooms in a corporate pattern of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark agreed to revise its policies to prevent bias and to
attract minority customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under today's settlement with the Justice Department, the
21-unit hotel chain has agreed to adopt a comprehensive plan which
will ensure that every hotel will be operated in a
nondiscriminatory fashion,'' said Reno. ``It will create an
effective method for investigating and resolving complaints. It
will retain an independent monitor to ensure that the chain is
complying with the agreement, and it will employ strategies to
attract minority customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials said Adam's Mark is ready to move ahead ``now
that this lawsuit is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While Adams Mark is committed to equality and has never
intentionally done anything wrong, we apologize for any actions
that may have made any of our guests feel uncomfortable or
unwelcome,'' said Fred Kummer, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam's Mark chose to do the right thing,'' said Florida
Attorney General Bob Butterworth, who announced the settlement with
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will stay in effect for four years and calls for
Adam's Mark to hire an outside monitor _ Project Equality of Kansas
City, Mo. _ to ensure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Project Equality will investigate any
complaints filed by Adam's Mark guests, design and monitor a
non-discrimination training program for hotel employees, and
establish a marketing plan with the hotel to attract African
American guests.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is still subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark, based in St. Louis, owns hotels in 13 states. The
cities it serves include Atlanta; Grand Junction, Colo.; Dallas;
Houston; San Antonio; Clearwater Beach, Fla.; Orlando; Columbus,
Ohio; Charlotte, N.C., and Winston-Salem, N.C. The chain is
building what the company says will be the largest hotel in
Jacksonville, Fla.

WEAPONS PROGRAM

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ President Clinton and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee clashed Tuesday over two critical security
issues, as India's leader rejected Clinton's appeal for early talks
with Pakistan over the fate of Kashmir and insisted on India's
right to bear nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's responses appeared to thwart Clinton's central aims
in coming here: to defuse tensions between Pakistan and India; and
to try to roll back a nuclear arms race between the South Asian
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues were unexpectedly inflamed after unidentified gunmen
massacred 40 people Monday night in Kashmir, the Himalayan state at
the root of Indo-Pakistani friction.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee implicitly blamed Pakistan for sponsoring the attack _
and other terrorist acts that have bedeviled Kashmir for years.
Referring to such attacks, Vajpayee warned darkly in a news
conference that, ``We have the means and the will to eliminate this
menace.'' He declined, when pressed for further explanation, to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Vajpayee hailed their summit here as the
long-overdue opening of a new chapter in relations between the
United States and India, a democratic nation of 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack, however, assured that differences over U.S. and
Indian policies concerning nuclear arms and Pakistan would overtake
the broader message of Indo-American partnership Clinton had hoped
would be sent by his visit here, the first by a U.S. president in
22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged India to abandon its nuclear arms program, and
Vajpayee flatly refused. After a meeting and lunch with Clinton,
Vajpayee told reporters, ``I've explained to President Clinton the
reasons that compel us to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   India conducted a series of nuclear test explosions in May 1998.
Pakistan quickly followed with its own tests, adding the threat of
a nuclear exchange to the highly charged rivalry between
subcontinental neighbors that have fought three wars over Kashmir
since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pressed India on the need to enter into a diplomatic
dialogue with Pakistan _ which he has offered to help mediate _
over Kashmir, divided into sections of Indian and Pakistani control
by the fragile cease-fire boundary known as the line of control.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee spurned that proposal as well, saying that ``problems
between countries of the region should be resolved peacefully by
the concerned countries themselves.'' There has been virtually no
diplomatic contact for months, analysts say, between Pakistan and
India and tensions between them are near a 30-year high.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message was muddled, moreover, when he appeared to
hand Vajpayee an excused absence from such talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some way must be found to renew the dialogue,'' Clinton said.
``But you cannot expect a dialogue to go forward unless there is an
absence of violence and a respect for the line of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders made their remarks during a joint news conference
following a bilateral meeting here in India's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even as India hardened its positions and escalated its rhetoric,
this country's president took the unusual step of publicly
lecturing Clinton for suggesting that tensions between India and
Pakistan, home to the world's third-largest and eighth-largest
armies, respectively, have raised the risk of war between the
world's two newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been suggested that the Indian subcontinent is the most
dangerous place in the world today, and Kashmir is a nuclear
flashpoint,'' India's president, Kocheril Raman Narayanan, said in
a prepared toast to Clinton at a state dinner Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``These alarmist descriptions will only encourage those who want
to break the peace and indulge in terrorism and violence,''
Narayanan said, as Clinton, his guest of honor, looked on from his
seat directly across a long banquet table from his host.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a similar theme earlier, Vajpayee said talk of possible
war in the region was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not so bad as it is made out to be,''
Vajpayee said. ``There are differences. There have been clashes.
There is the problem of cross-country terrorism. Innocent people
are being killed. But there is not threat of any war . . . and
nobody should think in those terms in this subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not respond directly to the remarks, which appeared
to target comments he made to members of the clergy during a March
9 White House event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous place in the world today, I think you could
argue, is the Indian subcontinent and the line of control in
Kashmir,'' Clinton told the religious leaders at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called line of control is the fragile cease-fire boundary
agreed to by India and Pakistan following fighting in 1971 over
control of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The province is under the formal authority of India. Portions of
it, though, are actually controlled by Pakistan, which has never
accepted India's sovereignty over the predominantly Muslim region
and has supported repeated incursions into Kashmir by separatist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 people massacred Monday night were Sikhs, an
ethno-religious group that combines elements of Hinduism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. officials had
made no judgment as to who was responsible for the killings, which
vied all day Tuesday with Clinton's state visit for air time on
Indian television.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, though, laid the blame on Pakistan. Clinton plans to
journey on Saturday to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad to meet
with Chief Army Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who overthrew the elected
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last October.
</P>
<P>
   Without specifically naming Pakistan, Vajpayee said that
``whenever there are chances of both countries coming together . .
. there is a deliberate design to foment trouble, to encourage
killing, mass murders, to sabotage any attempt to bring about
normalcy in this part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vajpayee, ``This policy is not going to pay, and I hope
this question will be discussed by the president in Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials tried to play down the rhetorical skirmishes that
dominated what was billed as a day of new directions and diplomacy
for U.S. relations with India, the second most populous nation on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts had cautioned, also, that any progress in
easing Indo-Pakistani relations or trimming India's nuclear sails
would likely come from behind the scenes diplomacy and might not be
publicly visible for months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vajpayee did manage to sign a joint communique,
calling for regular consultations between the two governments on a
host of shared issues ranging from terrorism control to
environmental protection and economic development.

dangerous place in the world today, and Kashmir is a nuclear
flashpoint,'' India's president, Kocheril Raman Narayanan, said in
a prepared toast to Clinton at a state dinner Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``These alarmist descriptions will only encourage those who want
to break the peace and indulge in terrorism and violence,''
Narayanan said, as Clinton, his guest of honor, looked on from his
seat directly across a long banquet table from his host.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a similar theme earlier, Vajpayee said talk of possible
war in the region was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not so bad as it is made out to be,''
Vajpayee said. ``There are differences. There have been clashes.
There is the problem of cross-country terrorism. Innocent people
are being killed. But there is not threat of any war . . . and
nobody should think in those terms in this subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not respond directly to the remarks, which appeared
to target comments he made to members of the clergy during a March
9 White House event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous place in the world today, I think you could
argue, is the Indian subcontinent and the line of control in
Kashmir,'' Clinton told the religious leaders at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called line of control is the fragile cease-fire boundary
agreed to by India and Pakistan following fighting in 1971 over
control of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The province is under the formal authority of India. Portions of
it, though, are actually controlled by Pakistan, which has never
accepted India's sovereignty over the predominantly Muslim region
and has supported repeated incursions into Kashmir by separatist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 people massacred Monday night were Sikhs, an
ethno-religious group that combines elements of Hinduism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. officials had
made no judgment as to who was responsible for the killings, which
vied all day Tuesday with Clinton's state visit for air time on
Indian television.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, though, laid the blame on Pakistan. Clinton plans to
journey on Saturday to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad to meet
with Chief Army Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who overthrew the elected
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last October.
</P>
<P>
   Without specifically naming Pakistan, Vajpayee said that
``whenever there are chances of both countries coming together . .
. there is a deliberate design to foment trouble, to encourage
killing, mass murders, to sabotage any attempt to bring about
normalcy in this part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vajpayee, ``This policy is not going to pay, and I hope
this question will be discussed by the president in Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials tried to play down the rhetorical skirmishes that
dominated what was billed as a day of new directions and diplomacy
for U.S. relations with India, the second most populous nation on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts had cautioned, also, that any progress in
easing Indo-Pakistani relations or trimming India's nuclear sails
would likely come from behind the scenes diplomacy and might not be
publicly visible for months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vajpayee did manage to sign a joint communique,
calling for regular consultations between the two governments on a
host of shared issues ranging from terrorism control to
environmental protection and economic development.

<P>
   MICKLETON, England _ For American kids, pudding means the
gloppy, yummy stuff, usually chocolate or butterscotch, that comes
out of a cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the kids grow up around Boston, where they might
encounter Indian pudding, a confection of cornmeal, milk and
molasses that dates back to the Pilgrims. Or unless Mom and Dad are
Anglophiles, given to serving a suet pudding at Christmas dinner _
``like a speckled cannonball, so hard and firm,'' as Dickens
described it, ``blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited
brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, though, a fabulous array of soft, warm, sweet
puddings _ so many that a resourceful Mum could easily turn out a
different one every day of the month _ light up childhood mealtimes
and linger reassuringly decades later in the memories of
50-somethings and 60-somethings. They are the quintessential
nursery food, comforting to both body and spirit, and you will find
them on the menus of proletarian pubs and elitist clubs alike.
</P>
<P>
   A few classics, like bread-and-butter pudding and rice pudding,
have found their way into the American repertory of desserts for
grown-ups. Though delicious when homemade and served on a chilly
night _ especially, for some reason, a Sunday night _ they are tame
and a little bit bland, and they do not hint at the splendor of
some English specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Some puddings, like whim wham and chocolate puddle and jam
roly-poly, apple dappy and rhubarb hat and spotted dick, have
agreeably eccentric names that only enhance their appeal. (If the
last seems just too naughty for Americans, and ``more decorum is
required at the dinner table,'' a solicitous English cookbook
advises, it ``can also be called spotted dog.'')
</P>
<P>
   The English have always been great fruit lovers, but the growing
season here is short, and in the days before canning and freezing
were developed, only dried fruit was available for more than half
the year, along with jams and jellies. Many favorite puddings,
accordingly, are based on dates, raisins, sultanas (golden raisins)
figs and apricots. Steaming the pudding restores some of the
fruit's fresh, peak-season flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In the cold, damp climate that prevails here in fall, winter and
early spring, human bodies crave heat. Until well after World War
II, central heating was rare, so people took many of their calories
internally, often in the form of suet, or beef fat, used in making
puddings. Puddings earned a place on the British menu, it might be
said, for the same reason Shetland and cashmere sweaters found
their way into the British wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most cooks no longer use suet, the best of which
surrounds calves' kidneys, in its original form. Many substitute
butter or vegetable shortenings, but some use a product called
Atora (unavailable, so far as I know, in the United States), which
looks like half-inch bits of dry spaghetti. Made from suet mixed
with a small quantity of flour, extruded through nozzles, it is
easier to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Sinful, sugary, awash in calories, as gastronomically incorrect
as peanut butter and jelly, puddings fell out of favor for a while
in the health-obsessed 1970s and 1980s. But like American
steakhouses, English puddings have been undergoing a renaissance of
late. ``The rib-stickers especially,'' said Simon Hopkinson, a
leading English chef and food writer, ``are back in fashion in a
big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweet puddings, that is. The British never stopped eating what
they call savory puddings, including Yorkshire pudding, that
indispensable companion of roast beef (memorably defined by Ogden
Nash as ``a sort of popover that's tripped and popped under'').
Other unchanging standbys are steak and kidney pudding; pease
pudding, a puree of split peas, and black pudding, boudin noir to
the French, which is a rustic blood sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The revival in traditional sweet puddings began in the Lake
District. A young cook named Francis Coulson arrived there in 1949,
with pots and pans clanging against the spokes of his bicycle, and
set about creating what became one of the country's first and most
popular rural retreats, Sharrow Bay Country House Hotel. With his
partner Brian Sack, he slowly built a national reputation for
unpretentious hospitality and sound English food, not least an
irresistible dish he called sticky toffee pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Spongelike, with fragments of crust here and there, the pudding
is bathed in a viscous butterscotch sauce, with ice-cold cream
poured over the whole shooting match at the last minute. The
texture and the dishearteningly delicious taste owe a lot to the
pitted dates in the batter. It is still on the menu at Sharrow Bay,
though Coulson died last year, on the day the hotel opened for its
50th season. Other versions, good and less good, grace menus across
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Another boost came from the Pudding Club, started by a bunch of
die-hard chauvinists determined to beat back the assault of frozen
supermarket Black Forest gateaux. They got together in 1985 at
Three Ways House in Mickleton, a crossroads hotel in the Cotswolds,
near Stratford-on-Avon, and their successors still meet there,
usually the first and third Friday of each month. At each
gathering, seven puddings, cooked in basins shaped like mixing
bowls, are paraded before the guests and carried to a buffet.
</P>
<P>
   You can go back as often as you like and take as big a chunk out
of the moist, dark hemispheres as you care to, but only after
clearing your plate each time. Loose clothing recommended. And no
mixing: only one pudding at a time. Cream and custard are always
offered _ not creme anglaise, which is scorned as much too foreign
and too effete, but properly Edwardian, slightly lumpy stuff made
from a premix called Bird's custard powder. (Me, I always go for
the effete stuff.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone, member or nonmember, can attend the meetings, although
enthusiasts tend to join on the spot. There are now more than 500
members. Pudding Club cookbooks and neckties, British television
shows and a site on the Internet (www.puddingclub.com) have helped
them to spread the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   The evening I stopped by with my wife, Betsey, and the kids, the
hotel put out three hearty puddings for us to enjoy, including the
commonplace syrup sponge, the more unusual chocolate-nut and the
obscure Lord Randall's pudding. Milord's favorite, based on
apricots and marmalade is named ``for a Victorian philanderer,'' I
was told (not entirely seriously, I suspect).
</P>
<P>
   Lacking proper training, lacking the requisite bloodlines, we
failed to make much of a dent in the spread. But many pudding heads
go wild. Peter Henderson, one of the hotel's owners, said that the
record, 18 helpings, was dispatched one cool night in November
1997, by ``a guy from near here, a guy we never saw again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays you come across first-class puddings all over Britain.
Not long ago, for example, I ate a delicious ginger pudding _ made
with ginger marmalade, ground ginger and candied ginger _ at the
Dartmoor Inn, a pub at Lydford in remote, windswept southwestern
England. A lot of people must have thought it was as fabulous as I
did; the young pastry chef, Nicola Butt, was ready with a detailed
recipe when I asked how it had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, I started noticing puddings on the tables of
some of London's celebrated chefs, often with a fresh twist.
Alastair Little, who spends a lot of time in Italy when not cooking
at one of his London bistros, makes a bread and butter pudding with
slices of panettone, the light, yeasty Italian Christmas cake, and
with raisins well-soaked in grappa.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Ramsay, the talented, turbulent former soccer star whose
eponymous restaurant earned two stars in the latest Michelin guide,
ennobles the plebeian rice pudding by adding a touch of creme
anglaise.
</P>
<P>
   At an annual New Year's house party that we attend near Bath,
Simon Hopkinson sometimes makes a pair of unusual but traditional
puddings as notable for their appearance as for their heart-warming
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent book, ``Gammon and Spinach'' (Macmillan, London,
1998), he describes one of those, which is called apple hat, as a
``steaming damp dome sitting in a moat of yellow custard.'' Boiled
for two hours or more, it gets a final enrichment from a tablespoon
of thick cream, poured into a hole cut in the top of the dome,
which quickly melts down into the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Sussex Pond pudding, was judged by Jane Grigson, the
great advocate of English cooking, as the best of all the English
puddings. It was invented in the County of Sussex, south of London,
in the 17th century. Whole lemons are steamed inside, and the
citrus tang of their juices mingles with sugar and butter to form a
``pond'' around the pudding that is rich but uncloying. The lemon
itself emerges soft enough to cut with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Great stuff. But for me, there is no beating Francis Coulson's
sticky toffee pudding _ sometimes he got carried away and called it
``icky sticky'' _ during the colder months. I cannot keep myself
from ordering it when I see it on a menu, any more than an elephant
can resist peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Come summer, when berries are at their peak, when raspberries
and blackberries are abundant and currants are bursting with juice
(if you are lucky enough to find them at a farmers' market or
provident enough to keep a bush of your own), the king must yield
to the queen: summer pudding. Until I came across it 25 years ago,
I thought strawberry shortcake, the all-American midsummer treat,
was the greatest of berry desserts. No more.
</P>
<P>
   Summer pudding is simplicity itself _ berries and currants
barely simmered with sugar to release their juices, then poured
into a pudding basin lined with slices of slightly stale white
bread. Weighted and chilled for 24 hours or more, the bread, juices
and fruit merge, with the flavors of the berries balancing one
another, sweet and acid in equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in England, you serve the lovely purple mound with a
pitcher of thick Jersey cream. But I use creme fraiche when I make
a summer pudding at our weekend place in Pennsylvania, I substitute
blueberries for currants when I have to, and once, unable to find
blackberries, I sneaked in a few strawberries, even though no one
in England ever does that.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as Cervantes said (or was it Addison?) ``the proof of
the pudding is in the eating.''

NOT A BAD WAY TO OPEN A MUSSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many years ago in Barcelona, I saw mussels and clams
cooked ``a la plancha'' _ on a thick slab of hot metal much like
the griddles used by short-order cooks. The technique involved
tossing handfuls of the shellfish onto the hot grill, then scooping
them off as soon as they had opened up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common preparation in Spain and throughout the
Mediterranean, and the results are memorable: the plump, firm
mussels are filled with their own natural flavors as well as a
certain smokiness picked up as their juices burn on the hot
surface.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to me to try to duplicate this dish at home
until I tasted the ``black skillet'' mussels at the Black Cat, a
restaurant in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. In
some ways, the chef, Reed Hearon, has improved on the Mediterranean
staple. His mussels are presented in the same skillet in which they
cooked, so their juices _ cooked dry and stuck to the pan _ come
with them. Hearon serves the mussels with drawn butter; the idea is
to dip the mussel meat into the butter, then rub it on the surface
of the pan, where it picks up more of the smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The technique seemed perfect for home cooking, but I was a
little worried: what seems simple in a chef's hands doesn't always
work for the rest of us. Maybe, I thought, Hearon uses a 700-degree
oven to make all of this happen. But when I called him, he was
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun dish,'' he said, ``and one I do at home all the
time. It works great on either gas or electric stoves, and all you
need is a heavy skillet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, he added, need the skillet be all that hot _ when a few
drops of water dance across its surface, it's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any hotter than that and you run the risk of incinerating the
mussel shells,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   On no account should the pan become white-hot. Beyond that, he
said, it's just a matter of keeping the mussels in a single layer
and taking them off the heat as soon as the juices evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   I was still suspicious, but when I gave it a try I was stunned
and delighted: there were no problems. The mussels started opening
on contact with the skillet, the juices ran out and evaporated, and
the dish was done in about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I served it with drawn butter the first time, but abandoned that
once I realized how delicious the mussels are with no more than
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon was right about this dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best kind of cooking,'' he said. ``One in which
you start with a great product and don't mess it up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>

   BLACK SKILLET MUSSELS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Reed Hearon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds mussels, washed and debearded
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat a large cast-iron or heavy steel skillet over high heat
about 5 minutes, or until drops of water dance across the surface.
Add mussels in one layer. (Your pan may hold more or less than 1{
pounds; use as many as will fit comfortably.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Cook mussels, shaking pan occasionally, until they begin to
open. Meanwhile, in a small pan over low heat, melt butter if
you're using it. When all mussels are open and their juices have
evaporated in the hot pan, about 10 minutes, remove from heat,
sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve immediately in pan with
butter for dipping.

the last. By MARIANNE MEANS.

   NEW YORK _ It may have been my first love _ before Clark Gable,
before Bobby Sherman, even before Jonathan Mink in the second
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Meat ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   My fixation began with a prototype more appropriate to a Jewish
girl, meat kreplach, which my grandmother fried and served with
applesauce. But growing up in the era of checkered-tablecloth
Italian restaurants, I soon established a pattern of gluttony by
ordering _ and finishing _ two portions of meat ravioli from the
children's menu. By the time I was in first grade my parents
figured it was cheaper to pretend I was 21.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I remember ordering meat ravioli was in the
mid-'80s at La Boheme in Greenwich Village. It was delicious, with
its tomato and meat sauce and thin topping of toasty mozzarella,
like ravioli and pizza in one.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen it since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you noticed that no one serves meat ravioli anymore?'' my
friend, Suzanne, asked recently. A native Tennessean who moved to
New York in the '60s and immediately fell in love with all things
ethnic, she was the only one who shared my fixation, except for a
Jewish friend whose parents took him for Italian on the rare Sunday
nights they skipped Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   I assured her I had noticed (it's been off the menu at La Boheme
for years) and decided it was time to take action. I asked two
Italian-American friends for recommendations, both of whom said
they had grown up with cheese ravioli and looked askance at the
notion of meat.
</P>
<P>
   But meat's what I remember most vividly. We used to go out to
dinner every Sunday, my mother's weekly emancipation, and when we
went for Italian, we drove to one of a few places near where we
lived in Passaic, N.J; either Bob's or Pompeii or Guiliano's. The
last was a dark restaurant where my mother would order a cocktail,
delivered from the even darker bar in the next room, while my
brother and I each had Cokes (only one!) which we had to make last.
My father drank wine and gave us a sip, but who wanted that when
you could have Coke?
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the adults started in on plates of antipasto filled
with stinky anchovies and slimy peppers, they gave us quarters so
we could each pick songs from the jukebox (Pompeii was the coolest,
boasting selections like ``Pretty Woman''), and when we were done
fighting over whose songs went first and got back to the table and
STILL didn't drink our Cokes, my ravioli would finally appear. It
came nestled in its individual silver pan, casserole style, and I
would cut through the steaming layers with a fork, which felt like
opening 10 presents at once.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mozzarella on top then, just Parmesan cheese, if
you wanted it, which I never did. It smelled awful, which was why I
never ordered cheese ravioli, convinced it would smell the same.
And anyway, I didn't want anything to interfere with the way the
meat inside the pasta tasted different from the meat in the tomato
sauce, and I made sure each bite had some of both, until, alas, the
pan was empty.
</P>
<P>
   And what that really meant was that the weekend was over and
there was school the next day. And even though we got pennies to
throw in the wishing well at Guiliano's, that was it. Finished. The
meal, the weekend, all of it. We had no choice but to face the doom
of school.
</P>
<P>
   With the taste of those Sundays in my mouth, I sat down and
called 52 Italian restaurants in Manhattan, looking for meat
ravioli. Eight had it. Eight! Almost every restaurant had cheese
ravioli. Some had pumpkin. Or butternut squash, shitake mushroom or
smoked salmon. I even found rabbit and venison ravioli in truffle
broth. But old-fashioned meat ravioli in a tomato-based meat sauce?
Sorry, Signora, no.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the eight restaurants was in Little Italy. I called
every one I could find, with no luck. At Il Palazzo, a waiter told
me that no one carries it anymore. ``People don't trust meat
filling as much as they did,'' he said. ``Most restaurants buy it
frozen, so I wouldn't order it unless it's a special. Cheese you
can whip up quickly. Meat takes longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Raffetto, president of the Raffetto Corp., a family-owned
business in SoHo that supplies restaurants and stores with ravioli,
said: ``Everyone now wants pumpkin and lobster. We still make meat
for our store on Houston Street, with my grandfather's recipe from
Genoa. We sell a nice little amount, and around Christmas and
Easter we sell 10 times as much. But it ain't what it used to be.
Grandma passed away, the kids moved to the suburbs, and over the
years we've sold less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   But I ate my meat ravioli in the suburbs. Where did it go?
</P>
<P>
   I asked a few Italian chefs, who told me that meat ravioli, like
other stuffed pastas, was originally a labor-intensive feast day
dish in certain regions of Northern Italy. First the stuffing is
made, then the pasta, then the individual pieces are filled and
cooked, and mixed with the sauce _ cooked separately _ that
accompanies the dish.
</P>
<P>
   But in America this tradition, like so many, changed to fit the
immigrants' new circumstances, which meant a drastic shift in
ingredients. Lidia Bastianich, who with her son, Joe, owns Felidia
and Becco in New York and Lidia in Kansas City, is at work on a
series about Italian-American cooking for PBS. She makes the point
that, as with meatballs, which were not cooked with sauce in Italy,
but began to be here to improve the flavor of lackluster tomatoes,
ravioli was also transformed, from the festive to the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with ravioli, the idea of it sort of got switched here
through commercialization,'' she said. Certainly, most Americans
learned to think of meat ravioli as nothing more complicated than
opening a can of blanded-down Chef Boyardee.
</P>
<P>
   In some Italian households, though, the dish became a way to use
up odds and ends. As Mario Batali, the chef at Babbo and Po, said:
``The classic meat ravioli of our childhood was based on the
economics of the kitchen, using leftovers. That was how Grandma
stretched the meat.'' Though Batali does not make a traditional
meat ravioli at Babbo, he makes something called Jacob's Pyramids,
a larger variation that is filled with either braised lamb, pork
shoulder or brisket, and served in butter and sage. ``After
braising it for days, I don't want to mask the nuance of the
stuffing with a tomato sauce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I see his point, though I also agree with Tony May, the owner of
San Domenico and Gemelli, when he says, ``A standard recipe is no
longer of interest. A chef who cooks ravioli standing on his head,
that's of interest.'' (For the record, neither of his places serve
meat ravioli, either.)
</P>
<P>
   I began my search at Gino on Lexington Avenue at 60th Street, a
restaurant I love. Michael Miele, the chef, assured me that meat
ravioli was on the menu, though I'd never noticed it before. There
it was, Homemade Ravioli, which I had always assumed was cheese. It
was served on a plate, not in a pan, and I found it only ordinary.
I spent most of the meal snitching the excellent sausage and
peppers from my husband's plate, instead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Next, I tried Gene's on West 11th Street, with dismal results.
The ravioli were undercooked and had the consistency of cardboard,
one step up from a school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this quest was hopeless, I thought, trudging back to the
subway with heartburn. Here I am, trying to recreate a phantom
taste from childhood with food my mouth might no longer crave.
After all, everyone's tastes change. Maybe even the best meat
ravioli wouldn't thrill me now.
</P>
<P>
   But that night I went to Pietro's, the Italian steakhouse on
East 43rd Street. Meat ravioli is available there as an appetizer
or entree and it was quite good. The winey-tasting Bolognese sauce
was more sophisticated than what I remember, but the dish was
satisfying enough to order again.
</P>
<P>
   My spirits rose. Until I went to Da Tommaso, on Eighth Avenue at
53rd Street. Ravioli there is made with a sauce of sun-dried
tomatoes, peppers and white wine. Sun-dried tomatoes and meat
ravioli? For heaven's sake! The ravioli themselves were tasteless,
the entire enterprise misconceived and depressing. I quit halfway
through.
</P>
<P>
   My luck was not much better at Via Oreto, on First Avenue at
61st Street, or Nanni's on East 46th Street. Via Oreto made the
ravioli to order after I called ahead, and it was adequate, though
salty. Nanni's serves meat ravioli as a lunch special every
Wednesday, but when I sat down at 1 p.m., I was told that all 20
portions had sold out by 12:15. I wasn't sure I believed it, and
with flashbacks of sun-dried tomatoes, wasn't sure I cared.
</P>
<P>
   At Villa Mosconi, on MacDougal Street at West Houston, the veal
parmigiana was very good and the staff couldn't have been nicer. My
friend, Suzanne, couldn't have either. She came with me and hid her
disappointment when the ravioli tasted like paste.
</P>
<P>
   So I was relieved that she agreed to try again the following
night when I discovered meat ravioli nirvana at Bravo Gianni on
East 63rd Street. When I had called, the chef, Gianni Garavelli,
answered the phone. I had asked my standard question, ``Do you have
meat ravioli on your menu?'' and he said: ``I am making once in a
while on Sundays. I can make if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted. ``The ravioli has a very particular taste,'' he said.
``It's been distorted in the United States where the press has
encouraged people to sell invented dishes as authentic food. In
Italy I learn the authentic way. I make for my family, but it's a
very laborious dish.''
</P>
<P>
   That Sunday, Garavelli sat down at the table with us. ``I
learned this from my sister Clementina, who lives near Genoa,'' he
said. ``In the meat sauce there is also spinach, borage and Swiss
chard, and you cook that with beef, veal, chicken gizzard, sausage,
sweetbreads and brains.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw the look on my face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that might take away the poetry for many people but
that's the way it's supposed to be done,'' he continued. ``And the
dough is very thin. The beauty of ravioli is the most fine pasta
because the edge is double. The meat sauce with it is a ragu. Are
you ready?''
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to back out now. I smiled bravely. Bring on the
brains.
</P>
<P>
   The minute he presented a copper pan filled with ravioli, my
bliss began. The smell was heavenly. The pasta was supple, almost
springy, the filling divine. I didn't care what was in there; it
was light and tasty and I only wanted more. The sauce was
old-fashioned enough to qualify as what I remembered, while
revealing a complexity I could appreciate only after decades of
eating and cooking. I suddenly couldn't remember the other taste,
there was only this taste, the only one that had ever mattered. It
was the romance novel of meat ravioli, the true love that had
eluded me for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Garavelli looked at us from across the room and I saw him smile.
This man had accomplished what I had assumed was impossible: the
perfect adult rendering of a childhood memory, Cokes and wishing
wells not required. When I realized I didn't have to go to school
the next day, I thought I might cry.
</P>
<P>
   After unabashedly stuffing myself, I took the scant leftovers
home. The following morning, I woke up and devoured them before I
even made coffee. I looked at the empty container for about two
seconds before picking up the phone to make another reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to come into the kitchen before and see how I
make?'' Garavelli asked.
</P>
<P>
   I considered it. ``No, I don't think so,'' I said, finally.
``But have you ever thought about getting a jukebox?''
</P>

 &HT;    ADAM'S MARK HOTEL CHAIN SETTLES TWO DISCRIMINATION LAWSUITS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Adam's Mark hotel chain has agreed to pay $8
million and implement non-discrimination policies to settle two
lawsuits, Attorney General Janet Reno announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark admitted no wrongdoing in an agreement ending a
class-action lawsuit filed by African-American plaintiffs and
joined by the state of Florida, but will pay $4.4 million to guests
and visitors at the chain's Daytona Beach hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The case began after five African American college students said
the hotel them _ but not white guests _ wear bright orange
wristbands to get into the hotel during last spring's Black College
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark will also pay $1.5 million to four historically
black colleges in Florida for scholarships and internships in hotel
and hospitality management. It also agreed to pay $112,000 to the
four schools _ Florida A&AMP;M University, Bethune-Cookman College,
Edward Waters College and Florida Memorial College _ to coordinate
and promote the annual Black College Reunion over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Another $1.75 million will go for attorney fees, and about
$250,000 to administer the payments to members of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five students who brought the original suit will get
$25,000. Another 1,200 guests and an undetermined numbers of their
visitors will also share in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate suit, the Justice Department alleged that the
chain violated the Civil Rights Act by charging black customers
higher prices than whites and segregating them in less desirable
rooms in a corporate pattern of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark agreed to revise its policies to prevent bias and to
attract minority customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under today's settlement with the Justice Department, the
21-unit hotel chain has agreed to adopt a comprehensive plan which
will ensure that every hotel will be operated in a
nondiscriminatory fashion,'' said Reno. ``It will create an
effective method for investigating and resolving complaints. It
will retain an independent monitor to ensure that the chain is
complying with the agreement, and it will employ strategies to
attract minority customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials said Adam's Mark is ready to move ahead ``now
that this lawsuit is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While Adams Mark is committed to equality and has never
intentionally done anything wrong, we apologize for any actions
that may have made any of our guests feel uncomfortable or
unwelcome,'' said Fred Kummer, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam's Mark chose to do the right thing,'' said Florida
Attorney General Bob Butterworth, who announced the settlement with
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will stay in effect for four years and calls for
Adam's Mark to hire an outside monitor _ Project Equality of Kansas
City, Mo. _ to ensure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Project Equality will investigate any
complaints filed by Adam's Mark guests, design and monitor a
non-discrimination training program for hotel employees, and
establish a marketing plan with the hotel to attract African
American guests.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is still subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark, based in St. Louis, owns hotels in 13 states. The
cities it serves include Atlanta; Grand Junction, Colo.; Dallas;
Houston; San Antonio; Clearwater Beach, Fla.; Orlando; Columbus,
Ohio; Charlotte, N.C., and Winston-Salem, N.C. The chain is
building what the company says will be the largest hotel in
Jacksonville, Fla.

cereal.'' She counted the items off on her fingers. ``Lunch doesn't
count because no one is home. At night you eat refrigerator food _
that is, sandwich stuff _ or you go out,'' she declared, dusting
her hands together as if to remove excess flour. I've taken a page

 &HT;    Bamboo's tender shoots making dramatic leaps
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 23.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walking through the garden the other day, I knew
spring had sprung. Playing off one another in a symphony of sights
and sounds were, among others, daffodil, iris, quince, saucer
magnolia, lenten rose, flowering almond, azalea, cherry, Scotch
broom. And bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, bamboo. In all its incarnations _ good, bad, lovely,
reluctant, it is as much a harbinger of this soft season as any of
the flowers whose scents and petals arrest beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, whenever I go to the garden this time of year, I search
for the first shoots springing from the golden bamboo and the
black. The gray, too. Those were the first I planted 11 years ago
for their gentle whistling, rustling, swaying in soft breezes,
their bent-doubleness during ice storms and blowdowns. (About 5
feet tall when I planted them, some now reach 20 feet. Some bamboo
growers cultivate timber canes 50 feet tall.) Over the years I have
planted and admired bamboo that zigs and zags, bamboo with swollen
canes, spotted canes, some with swollen joints. Weeping bamboo,
bamboo with leaves like palms.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered plantings under windows and those away from the house
have brought much drama and movement to the garden. Through windows
and doors, the mobile canes entertain and intrigue endlessly,
bringing the outdoors inside, integrating house and garden.
Outside, in the garden, those same canes create a tropical,
mystical tour, transporting all who appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   While bamboo's lacy leaves always lend an evergreen air to the
bleakest winter day, it is this time of year that the plant seems
most lively, as its tender shoots jump from the ground, epitomizing
primeval.
</P>
<P>
   And I do mean jump. Turn your head for a day or so, and those
6-inch shoots reach your waist. This kudzu-like reality makes
bamboo growers pay close attention to what's going on in the
corners and shadows of the garden. As I welcome the shoots to spots
where I want them, I also diligently break them off at about 6
inches when they shoot up where I don't want them. For more than a
decade this has worked just fine, despite friends who shake their
heads, pitying any fool who grows bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, I have felt foolish many times as I watched dwarf
bamboo try to take over my garden; it's not for nothing it is
called a ground cover. Unlike the canes, this low-growing, plastic
grass catches no breeze, emits no sounds and gives no sway. It just
eats up space, choking out other plants. Beauty is its sole asset.
</P>
<P>
   So, about four years ago, I cut it back, dug it out and hoped to
kill it. For months, I patrolled the garden with pruners, snipping
each sprig that pushed up, eventually wearing out a pair of the
cutters. Patience and mindless warfare eventually paid off; last
spring was the first that did not bring a revival of the plastic
grass. Still, I keep a sharp eye _ and even sharper pruners.
</P>
<P>
   Never, ever planting dwarf bamboo (except in containers) is just
one lesson I've learned since I began loving the reeds. Another is,
like many allegedly fast-spreading plants, canes never grow fast
and far if you want them to.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I put in several clumps of canes at the cabin in
McCaysville, Ga., hoping to cover a large area with a forest of
reeds, seeking those sounds and sights that flow through the open
windows and doors. I'm still waiting for the clumps to produce
their first new canes.
</P>
<P>
   With this fertile season, hope surges again. Like fresh new
shoots untamed.

 &HT;    Contractor showers owners with problems
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 23.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob and Joyce Collins just wanted a shower. What they
got was $800 worth of damage to their bathroom _ and major bruises
to their egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were way too sophisticated to be taken, but at
this point we're feeling like stupid senior citizens,'' Joyce says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The job: Like many people their age _ she's 66 and he's 68 _
the East Point, Ga., residents had found it difficult in recent
years to get in and out of the bathtub. They decided that
installing a shower would help the situation. ``We've never really
had a shower in our home of nearly 50 years and were so happy to
finally get one,'' Joyce says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The hire: The Collinses were excited to get a referral for a
remodeler who was young. ``When you get our age, everyone you know
out there is retiring,'' she
</P>
<P>
   says.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor met with the couple on Nov. 20, told them he'd
been in business for 15 years, showed them a portfolio of bathrooms
he'd completed and offered a contract, which they signed. He
required a 50 percent deposit _ $825 _ before beginning the work
and agreed to start two days later.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The rub: The couple paid the deposit, but the contractor
failed to show up that Monday. He came on Tuesday and began ripping
out the bathroom wall, bagging the debris and drilling holes in the
tile floor, where he mounted a two-by-four.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, the contractor told the Collinses he would not be
back for a week. When that time passed, he left a message on their
answering machine saying he couldn't make it back for yet another
week. When that appointment came and went, the couple left repeated
messages for him, none of which were returned.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The fallout: ``He left a large open hole the full length of
the shower area where you can see the ground, feel cold air and
entertain roaches; and without any insulation the (nearby) airport
sounded as if the landing strips were in our toilet,'' Joyce says.
``What he did consists of nothing. He did harm to our bathroom, not
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The resolution: The couple filed a complaint against the
contractor with the Better Business Bureau. The contractor later
``pleaded ignorant about the whole thing,'' explaining that he'd
left his business in the hands of a partner who had not followed
through. The contractor has made no attempt to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Collinses have since hired another contractor from a
friend's referral. ``He built us a beautiful shower,'' she says.
``It's just gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The lesson: The couple has their shower but are left drained
from disappointment _ in mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor had instantly won the Collinses' trust with his
sad stories about a dying mother and other family tragedies. ``We
believed this boy,'' Joyce says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always dealt honestly with people and cannot understand
how anyone can do this kind of evil to a couple who treated him
kindly. What really bothers me is that if he just got into a jam
and needed our money, why didn't he just come to us and tell us the
truth?''

 &HT;    Avoid renovation horror stories of others by doing your homework
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March. 23.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Their stories drip with different emotions _
frustration, disappointment, anger, even revenge _ but the
circumstances surrounding their home-renovation sagas are much the
same.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasize a lack of work ethic _ contractors who not only
fail to show up for a job but don't bother to call. Contractors who
do shoddy work, then refuse to fix it. Unscrupulous ones who gouge
the unsuspecting elderly of thousands of dollars for work worth a
lot less. And worst of all, thieves who take large deposits with no
intention of attempting a job.
</P>
<P>
   Home &AMP; Garden recently asked readers to share their renovation
stories. Dozens wrote of the hassles, horrors and heartaches. Some
disputes are in arbitration, others in litigation and a few even
under criminal investigation, so names were not included.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not all tales were tragic. Some readers managed to live
through Home Improvement Hell and tell about it. They explained how
they protected themselves, how they formed a relationship with
their contractor and, in the end, how they got exactly what they
wanted. Their stories serve to restore a little faith in an often
maligned industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everybody's always talking about contractor
problems,'' said Bruce Walters, a contractor who works in the north
metro area. ``But I wish people would realize there's an awful lot
of good ones out there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have to share some responsibility when a project
fails. More information is available today than ever before for
finding, interviewing and hiring a remodeler. The key is constant
communication before, during and after a project to ensure
everyone's goals are met.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in most remodeling situations is that people go
for the lowest dollar amount without checking credentials and
references. And, sadly, once you start tearing out a wall or
ceiling, you find problems you never knew were there, which result
in cost overruns,'' said Mark Fitzgerald, executive vice president
of the Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association. ``Those things
need to be brought up and (a decision made on) how they will be
handled at the beginning of the contractual process.''
</P>
<P>
   For many consumers, the first surprise is that contractors are
not regulated. Georgia is one of 14 states that do not require
builders and remodelers to be licensed. They operate under county
business licenses only _ so, for as little as $50, anyone can
declare himself a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The other surprise is that renovation _ unlike building a new
home _ often involves major lifestyle disruptions. ``Because
someone often is living in the house throughout the project, you're
disturbing the flow and routine of personal lives,'' Fitzgerald
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not every project ends in soured relationships. Many
construction workers become friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our project took 1 1/2 years, and not all of the days were
fun-filled. We had moments when we had to leave (no utilities), we
had no water (sewer backed up) and on and on,'' said Stacy Wypyski
of Atlanta, for whom Weidmann &AMP; Associates of Alpharetta, Ga.,
completed a major renovation. ``But these people were always here
... never promised anything they couldn't deliver and were so easy
to work with we gave a catered dinner party for the contractor and
all of their subs. Including all their spouses, we had about 150
people. They had just become family.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy endings like hers result when homeowners take the time to
educate themselves, then find a contractor with whom they can
clearly communicate their ideas and develop a mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
   And while demand is extremely high in the Atlanta area because
of the strong economy, good contractors are worth the wait. Even
then, consumers should never stop asking questions, Fitzgerald
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard-earned money they're investing, and they need to
protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   F I N D I N G C A N D I D A T E S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't rely on newspaper ads or the Yellow Pages. Seek
referrals from friends or neighbors who recently had work done.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Contact the Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association
(770-938-9900) for a list of its Remodelors Council members who
work in your area. Other names are available through the Atlanta
chapter of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry
(404-766-7179).
</P>
<P>
   C H E C K R E F E R R A L S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask the potential remodelers for the names of three to five of
their clients, some within the last year and others three to five
years ago. Contact them to find out how the contractor dealt with
problems that may have cropped up years after completing a project.
Ask if they would hire the contractor again. Did the crew show up
on time? Was the project completed on time and within budget?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Visit the references' homes so you can see the work firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Contact the Better Business Bureau as well as the Governor's
Office of Consumer Affairs to determine whether any complaints have
been filed against the contractor and how they were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check court records to determine if the contractor has been
sued and how the case was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask the contractor if he participates in trade organizations
such as the NAHB's Remodelors Council. Membership can indicate a
commitment to professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   I N T E R V I E W I N G C A N D I D A T E S
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask contractors how long their company has been in business
(it typically takes at least five years to establish a financially
sound business), then check it out. Ask to see proof of business
licenses. (Georgia does not regulate builders so contractor
licenses are not required. And while legislation requiring
licensing is in being considered by a committee, the powerful
building industry for years has successfully fought licensing.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask for a permanent address, and phone and paging or answering
system numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask to see proof of general liability insurance as well as
workers' compensation insurance, required of any builder employing
more than three workers. You don't want to be held liable for
property damage or job site injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask contractors to describe their cleanup practices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get written estimates for the project, based on plans and
specifications, from at least three candidates worthy of
consideration. But don't let price alone determine your selection.
Hire the best candidate you can afford.
</P>
<P>
   G E T T I N G I T I N W R I T I N G
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you and your contractor share the common vision for
a project that results from thorough communication.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't assume your wishes, nor your schedule or budget, will be
met. Put them all in a contract. If the contractor doesn't offer
one, insist on it. The Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association
offers free samples of remodeling contracts (call 770-938-9900).
Basic stipulations include sketches, estimated start and completion
dates, descriptions and prices for all work and materials, a
payment schedule, lien releases so you're not held responsible by
any third-party nonpayment claims and cleanup provisions. Add at
least 10 percent to the project budget to cover cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Negotiate payments based on benchmarks in the project, such as
completion of the roofing and framing. Many firms require
one-fourth to one-third of the cost in advance, one-third midway
and the balance upon completion. Never pay cash.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure the contractor agrees to secure all necessary
building permits. The person who purchases them is the contractor
of record and therefore liable for the work.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get all warranties on work and materials, if offered.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be flexible and realistic. Remodeling is often harder and more
expensive than new construction. You don't always realize what's
involved until the project gets under way. Realize that obstacles
will arise.

 &HT;    Couple's dream of better home becomes nightmare
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March. 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rick and Vicki Good thought they'd taken every
precaution to protect themselves from unscrupulous contractors.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly two years after starting a remodeling job that should
have taken three months, the Atlanta residents are out nearly
$60,000 and left with such shoddy work that the kitchen sink fell
out of the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were doing all the right things _ had four or
five bids, picked the second most expensive contractor (they say
you get what you pay for), checked references, called the Better
Business Bureau,'' Vicki Good says. ``The man could sell ice cubes
to Eskimos, as the saying goes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The job: The Goods wanted to upgrade their kitchen, add a
bathroom and create a master suite. They contacted some of
Atlanta's most reputable remodelers, two of whom ``flat refused to
come south of Ponce,'' she says, preferring to work in more upscale
neighborhoods such as Virginia-Highland and Morningside.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The hire: The couple turned to newspaper ads and, after
talking to several contractors, hired one whom a neighbor had
recommended. Vicki cut back on her hours as a physician's assistant
at Grady Memorial Hospital so she could keep an eye on the project.
(Rick Good, 39, is a flight paramedic.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The rub: Their contract, signed in May 1998, required a 50
percent deposit upfront, which Vicki questioned but was told was
necessary to cover material costs. Though their check was cashed
two days later, the contractor didn't begin work for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Their tiny, solitary bathroom became Grand Central Station for
the couple, their three dogs and work crews. ``Ever try washing
dishes in the tub?'' asks Vicki, 37. ``Imagine doing this for five
months between showers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabinets didn't arrive until August and weren't installed until
late October.
</P>
<P>
   The Goods became suspicious when they asked to see the building
permit, which their contract stated the contractor would secure.
``I was told I would be a fool to want to permit the work,'' Vicki
says, because that would require city inspections. When she halted
the work, her relationship with the contractor became so hostile
that they were forced to communicate by notes.
</P>
<P>
   The permits eventually were secured, but the contractor returned
to the project only a few times over the next five months, leaving
what she calls incompetent and inexperienced workers to finish the
job. ``By July, he had basically washed his hands of us, as he had
gotten 80 percent of his money out of me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The contactor finally agreed to add a completion date to the
contract: Dec. 14, 1998 _ eight months after work began _ with
financial penalties for each day the job went over.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The fallout: While some items on her ``punch list'' were
completed, the quality, Vicki says, was horrible: drywall with
exposed nail heads, broken trim work, walls painted without being
primed, damage to a deck and a new heating and air-conditioning
system, and the undermounted sink that fell out after a couple of
months of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole miserable experience pushed me to the edge when, on
Dec. 23, we failed the electrical inspection for the second time
and the city gave us five days to remedy the faults, as they
created a fire hazard,'' Vicki says. ``Our power was to be turned
off!''
</P>
<P>
   The Goods fired the contractor and hired another to correct the
problems. But the next week, a worker delivered a final bill with a
letter in which the first contractor threatened to sue if the
couple didn't pay him. The Goods hired a lawyer and, in March 1999,
learned that the contractor had gotten a lien placed on their house
for failure to pay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The resolution: Because their lawyer estimated that a court
battle would cost them $15,000, the Goods filed a complaint with
the Better Business Bureau, hoping its arbitration process would
resolve the issues. But because the BBB has no authority to enforce
an arbitrator's decision, that process left the couple even more
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki contacted the consumer fraud division of the Fulton County
solicitor's office, which is investigating. Even a criminal
conviction, however, would do nothing to get the project completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we could afford to sue, he has no assets, so there's
nothing to go after,'' Vicki says. ``I am unable to sell my house,
as his lien would have to be paid, and I am not willing to reward
him for his bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiasco has cost the couple nearly $60,000, she says, and the
contractors they've contacted about finishing the job aren't
interested in correcting someone else's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The lesson: The Goods realize they made mistakes, especially
in failing to check out references. ``I should have gone to work
sites and followed him around,'' Vicki says. They also now know
they should never have agreed to a 50 percent deposit and that
their contract should have stipulated work deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, a year and a half later, I am still dealing with the
aftermath of this experience,'' she says, ``and wondering what else
is going to fall apart.''

 &HT;    Planning gets the job done without hassles
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, March 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tales of renovation horror are so common that many homeowners
would rather sell than take on a project.
</P>
<P>
   Geert and Debra Lievens had heard plenty, but because they loved
their house, their neighborhood and its schools, they decided to go
for it. ``We were dreading it, but we had long since outgrown our
home and needed the additional space badly,'' she says. ``Buying a
new home was out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to renovate didn't eliminate their fears. But they were
able to conquer them by educating themselves. The result is that
their project was completed ahead of schedule, to their desire and
without hassle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living through a renovation is tiring, stressful, dirty and
intrusive,'' said Debra, who works in marketing from her Garden
Hills home. ``For most of us, it also represents a huge financial
commitment and, hopefully, a good long-term investment. All the
more reason to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The job: She and her husband, an engineer, wanted a master
suite, a small second office, a sitting area and carport. A steep
slope in the back yard and complicated roof lines presented
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The hire: ``My husband and I had countless discussions about
the pros, the cons, the process, the results and, of course, the
money that would be involved,'' Debra says. They considered several
local design/build firms before hiring Sawhorse Inc., which had
already done two smaller projects for them. The latest would
involve adding some 800 square feet to their 2,100-square-foot
home.
</P>
<P>
   Before they first hired the company, the couple checked out its
references. ``Unexpected things would be inevitable, but I wanted
to know how the remodeler dealt with them, how they manage the
process, how they follow up on things,'' Debra says. ``When you're
talking about a big chunk of money and that much disruption in your
home, you want someone you can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The rub: There wasn't any _ something the Lievenses attribute
to taking their time, planning and communicating with their
remodeler. ``I had about five years to salivate over what I wanted,
and we spent a lot of time talking with them about how we'd use
every aspect of the renovation,'' Debra says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The fallout: The inevitable bumps occurred, most caused by
weather delays, but they were dealt with promptly, Debra says.
While the construction schedule in their contract called for four
months of work, the couple and their two kids braced for six. To
their delight, the project was completed five weeks early, on
budget and with results that exceeded their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The lessons: The Lievenses believe their project was
successful for several reasons _ they checked out the stability,
the design skills and the construction results of the firms they
considered. They also talked to references about how the companies
dealt with unforeseen developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a little luck, a positive attitude, the right team of
professionals and a common vision,'' she says, ``it is possible to
get it right.''

 &HT;     GOP SUMMIT URGED TO REPAIR BUSH-McCAIN SPLIT  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Winner George W. Bush and loser John McCain are
imperiling Republicans' chances of retaking the White House unless
the rivals for the GOP presidential nomination quickly hold a
summit signaling unity, GOP pollster Frank Luntz warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz, saying the candidates' post-primary coolness threatens to
drive independents into the arms of Vice President Al Gore, said
both Bush, the two-term Texas governor, and McCain, the three-term
senator from Arizona, shared responsibility for the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that McCain has not endorsed Bush up to this point is
a real problem for the Republicans,'' cautioned Luntz, the pollster
who helped Texas billionaire Ross Perot fashion a reform message in
1992 that enabled the Reform party candidate to capture 19 percent
of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of seeing a bridge built between McCain and Bush, you
see sniping going back and forth,'' added Luntz, who also helped
then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., draft the 1994 campaign manifesto
``Contract with America'' that helped the GOP win control of the
House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz spoke with reporters shortly before McCain returned to the
Senate floor for the first time since losing the GOP nomination to
Bush in hard-fought Republican presidential primaries that left a
bitter after-taste among many McCain supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to withhold public endorsement of Bush's
candidacy and vowed to continue his populist quest for campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to do what I can, working with my congressional
colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to help bring about the
changes to the practices and institutions of our democracy that
they want and deserve,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CBS News broadcast later Tuesday, McCain
said that he would support the GOP presidential nominee but left
the scope of his support for Bush ambiguous, saying: ``Exactly how
that happens and under what circumstances _ and my degree of
enthusiasm _ obviously are questions that are yet to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz, urging Bush and McCain to move quickly to public
rapprochement, said that without quickly forging unity between Bush
and McCain, the GOP could lose the White House for the third time
in three elections and relinquish control of the House after only
six years.
</P>
<P>
   With that much at stake, Luntz said, two former GOP party
leaders who are now lobbyists in Washington could serve as
intermediaries to overcome the GOP split _ former Republican
Chairman Haley Barbour, a Bush supporter, and former Rep. Vin
Weber, R-Minn., who worked for McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Republican leader needs to look John McCain in the face
and say, `You will elect Al Gore if you don't make amends with
George Bush,''' Luntz said. ``And somebody needs to look George
Bush straight in the eye and say, `Stop fighting over Michigan and
find the big picture.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized the McCain campaign's ``Catholic voter
alert'' telephone calls in the Michigan primary in which callers
reminded voters that Bush had addressed Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., where the founder has expressed anti-Catholic
views.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his campaign staff are ``playing with fire'' by
withholding public support for Bush, Luntz said. Continued
criticism of Bush inflames McCain supporters' ``fires of
hostility'' toward Bush, Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is at fault, as well, Luntz said, for refusing to reach
out to McCain. Bush ought to ``put a bear hug around McCain'' and
travel with him across the nation to set the stage for the pair to
sweep into the GOP convention in Philadelphia in July as a unified
team determined to reclaim the White House for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reluctance to make concessions to highlight McCain's
reform agenda ``makes no sense,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting that you kow tow,'' Luntz said.
``Everything in this town is up for grabs in six months. And if the
stakes are that high why play around? Why not reach out, and agree
to disagree but at least stop sniping at each other in public?''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Bush and McCain move quickly, Luntz said, Gore can
strengthen his appeal to the independent minded voters who lost
their candidate when McCain stopped campaigning following setbacks
in the 13 GOP primary contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is busily trumpeting reform-style rhetoric in a naked bid
to win McCain supporters and could pick up independent voters by
selecting Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Bush has to solidify these independent and
conservative Democrats now,'' Luntz added. ``Because if you throw
Lieberman into the mix, then the race is up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said the swing vote in the 2000 presidential election will
be the ``McCain middle'' _ voters who backed McCain in the GOP
primaries, Bill Clinton in 1996 and Ross Perot in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To win the White House, Bush needs to win over two-thirds of the
bloc to boost the GOP share of the vote from 45 percent to 55
percent. But if Gore can capture the swing constituency as Clinton
did in 1996, Luntz said, ``Gore becomes president.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We Americans have had our flappers, our boomers,
our hippies, our yippies, our yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the millennium dawns, it is altogether appropriate that
our English language respond to a new group for statisticians to
ponder and economists to dissect: those young multimillionaires
running dot-com businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What DOES one call 36-year-old Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, a
wunderkind whose company has set book-buying on its ear? Or Yahoo's
Jerry Yang, who was 27 when that Internet stock went public in
1996?
</P>
<P>
   Dot.comers? No, too obvious. Netnicks? No, again. Too Bill
Bradley. The best choice turned out to be right in front of my
nose: Who are Bezos, Yang, AOL's CEO Steve Case and eBay founder
Pierre Omidyar?
</P>
<P>
   They are, yes, young urban multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yummies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yummies are young, often under 40, and often enough under 30.
They are urban: Bezos' headquarters is in Seattle, Omidyar's in San
Jose. Multimillionaires? Is there any question?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, true yummies must appear to be unaffected by the money
they've made. They are more likely to drive a Honda (Bezos) and
live at their desk (many) than drive a Rolls and room at the Ritz.
This separates them from their more conspicuously consuming yuppie
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Yummies often start out in an inauspicious way. Case, for
example, developed toppings for Pizza Hut. Omidyar got the idea for
an on-line auction house from his fiancee's obsession with
collecting Pez dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   Yummies are almost always a part of computer culture, usually
the Internet. The staff of that unfortunate Fox TV show, ``Who
Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire?'', should have been suspicious
of bridegroom Rick Rockwell's ``multimillionaire'' status from the
beginning. He was said to be in ``real estate.'' (He also has
denied allegations that he has been a sleazeball in his treatment
of women, but that's a whole other category.)
</P>
<P>
   The term ``yummie'' comes not a minute too soon. Think of what
statisticians and journalists can do with it: research on the
yummie American character, investigative books by the likes of Bob
Woodward (``Dot.Commie''), movies about wives and girlfriends like
``The Attack of the Yummie Tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Can ``Yummies for Dummies'' be far behind?
</P>

FOR `AIDA' STAR, BROADWAY ISN'T MAIN CAREER ASPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since his childhood in Syosset on Long Island, all
Adam Pascal ever wanted to be was a rock singer. He dreamed of
fronting his own band and writing his own music. Though Billy Joel
was his idol as a singer, hard rock became his passion.
</P>
<P>
   But while pursuing that fantasy an unexpected detour came along
called ``Rent.'' Though he had never acted, Pascal was cast in the
lead role, the HIV-infected punk rocker and recovering addict Roger
Davis, in the original 1996 production of Jonathan Larson's
breakthrough musical at the New York Theater Workshop. When the
show moved to Broadway later that year, Pascal's work landed him on
the cover of Newsweek (a steamy photo with his co-star, Daphne
Rubin-Vega) and earned him a Tony Award nomination for best actor
in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Though gratified by the success, Pascal assumed that ``Rent''
would be his first and only theater gig. Surely now, he thought,
offers from record companies would come.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. Pascal, the reluctant Broadway
star, finds himself again in a lead role of a new musical, the
Disney-produced ``Aida,'' loosely based on the Verdi opera, with
music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice. Pascal plays Radames,
the commander of the Egyptian army, who is engaged to Amneris, an
Egyptian princess (Sherie Rene Scott), but falls in love, fatally
it turns out, with Aida (Heather Headley), a Nubian princess
captured and enslaved by the Egyptians. Directed by Robert Falls,
``Aida'' opens in New York on Wednesday at the Palace Theater at
Broadway and 47th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal had to be persuaded to take the role. But during a recent
interview at the theater, he seemed excited to be involved with the
show and at peace with his quixotic career. Moreover, a collection
of 12 of his rock songs is being released on the Internet by
Sh-K-Boom Records in late spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all music I've written myself,'' he said, out of breath
from having bounded up four flights of metal stairs to his
ramshackle dressing room at the former vaudeville house. A session
of notes with the director had detained him. ``This record is the
first time I've allowed myself to write music purely, without
trying to direct it to a certain audience,'' he added. ``Whether
people like it or not, I feel a huge sense of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roger in ``Rent,'' he was praised for the volatile anger,
exuberance and punky charisma he projected. On this busy day,
dressed in black jogging pants, an army-green thermal undershirt
and a cap from God's Love We Deliver, the organization that brings
hot meals to people with AIDS, Pascal, 29, was all optimism and
openness. Yet recalling the frustrations he faced after ``Rent''
rekindled his exasperation with the pigeonholing that pervades the
rock and pop industry. ``For a while there I worried that I had
fallen into this strange trap,'' Pascal said. After he left the
cast of ``Rent'' in late 1997, he formed the short-lived five-piece
Adam Pascal Band, which had a burst of success playing rock clubs
around Manhattan. ``We were doing great,'' he said, ``playing to
kids, 400 and 500 kids at a time, who really dug the music. But a
lot of rock people, producers and managers, looked at me and said,
`He's a theater guy.' We couldn't get them to come hear us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he accepted innumerable invitations to try out for roles
in television and film. ``It was a miserable experience,'' he said.
``I went into these auditions where people had big expectations of
me. Everyone would say, `I'm such a big fan, I'm really happy to
meet you, blah, blah, blah.' Then I'd do this bad audition. My lack
of experience came through. I felt like I was letting everyone
down, including myself. I realized I'm not interested in the
Hollywood-actor-boy thing. What I can offer is my singing.''
</P>
<P>
   That he can. When Bernard Telsey, the casting agent for ``Rent''
(and for ``Aida''), discovered Pascal singing in a grungy rock club
in 1995, he knew immediately that he had found an ideal Roger.
``Adam is raw, sexy, exciting, available,'' Telsey said recently.
``He really reaches audiences. So it's worth whatever course a
director has to go through to get him to do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greif, the director of ``Rent,'' was equally floored
when Pascal auditioned. ``He showed up with the tools, that
incredible voice, the ability to focus on intention,'' Grief
recalled. ``He had never done a play, but he had great instincts,
huge accessibility and could go very deeply from profound despair
to extraordinary joy.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``incredible voice'' was apparently a natural gift, evident
from the time Pascal was 11 and first tried singing with a
makeshift rock band some young friends had gotten together. With no
formal musical training, Pascal picks out his songs on the guitar.
He has never taken voice lessons, though he got some tips from a
professionally trained singer who was a colleague at a New York
fitness club where Pascal worked as a personal trainer. (It was a
job he kept for several months after ``Rent'' opened, fearing that,
as he put it, the ``whole thing might burst.'')
</P>
<P>
   He credits Tim Weil, the musical director of ``Rent,'' with
giving him a helpful regimen of warm-up scales and exercises. From
Weil he also learned the importance of enunciation, something that
most rock singers ignore in favor of the trademark rock mumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enunciation is a musical theater trick,'' Pascal said. ``If
you're having trouble getting a note, Tim told me, instead of
pushing, just say the word clearly and the note will be there.''
Pascal regrets the strain he put his voice through in smoky,
blaring rock clubs. ``Now I'm better aware of what I can and can't
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he can do vocally has been widely hailed by critics. His
voice is by turns plaintive and powerful, melting and earthy. And
he can modulate his sound, singing with focused, lean tone one
moment and thick, trembling vibrato the next.
</P>
<P>
   He is unfazed that his two Broadway roles have been based on
operatic characters. He has never seen Puccini's ``Boheme,'' the
inspiration for ``Rent,'' or ``Aida.'' Nor has he listened to
recordings. ``It's kind of irrelevant,'' he said. ``I didn't want
to taint my ideas about what `Rent' and `Aida' were about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no opera fan, he is ``a fan of these wonderful opera
stories,'' he added. ``Good stories are hard to come by. It's
important to keep telling them in new ways.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pascal is happy with the progress of his career. And
his life: his wife of just over a year, Cybele Pascal, is a
playwright finishing a master's degree at Columbia University. As
for his rock 'n' roll fantasy, Pascal said that his recording's
release on an Internet rather than a major commercial label does
not bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a distribution deal is difficult, to say the least,''
he said. ``Besides, they take all your money. The fans I have from
`Rent' stay in touch on the Internet. So this is the best way to
reach them.'' And he is thrilled, he said, to be part of a
cutting-edge innovation in the music industry. ``If a situation
came along where we could get the record into the stores, we'd do
that as well,'' he said. ``But it's not a reason to sell your soul
to a distribution company.''
</P>
<P>
   If rock stardom eludes him, so be it, Pascal declares. ``I have
allowed myself to realize that I love doing musical theater,'' he
said. ``As long as I can do exciting new projects, I'll probably
continue.''

   POPE-HOLYLAND (Jerusalem) _ Saying he felt deep emotion setting
foot in Israel, ``the land where God chose to pitch his tent,''
Pope John Paul arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, and was instantly
given a taste of the kind of fierce political intensity that will
vein his long-awaited religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The
Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, welcomed the first pope to visit
Israel in 36 years, with a blunt, at times defensive speech that
instantly bore into some of the key issues dividing the Vatican and
the Israeli government. By Alessandra Stanley.

   CLINTON-INDIA (New Delhi) _ Pleading for restraint, President
Clinton won India's assurance Tuesday that ``there is no threat of

   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ The Republican leader of the

Democrats say it jeopardizes U.S. foreign policy and national

   SCOTUS-TOBACCO (Washington) _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt
a sharp if not entirely unexpected blow to the Clinton
administration's effort to curb smoking, ruling 5-4 that the Food
and Drug Administration had never received authority from Congress
to regulate tobacco products. The decision, rejecting rules
proposed by the agency in 1995 to restrict the marketing of
cigarettes to children and teen-agers, hands the question of
national tobacco regulation back to Congress. By Linda Greenhouse.

the U.S. attorney general can grant political asylum to keep the
boy in the United States. U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's

   RAPBROWN-SHOOTING (Atlanta) _ When the law came for him again
Monday, 33 years after he first went underground, the man who was
once called H. Rap Brown was back in Lowndes County, the place
where his life and that of many others began to undergo such
profound change in 1964. Once, he was one of scores of youthful
volunteers who worked there registering voters, building the basic
foundation of the civil rights movement. This time, Brown, now
known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, was back in Lowndes for a very
different reason. He had fled there from his home in Atlanta,
accused of using a high-powered assault rifle to shoot two Atlanta
sheriff's deputies at close range, one of whom died from massive
blood loss. By David Firestone.

   FED-RATES (Washington) _ The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit
more on the economy and the stock market on Tuesday, raising its
benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in an
attempt to prevent an outbreak of inflation. The move was no
surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints
over the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's
chairman, that he intended to continue with his policy of raising
rates in small, steady steps until he sees signs that the
supercharged economy is throttling back. Stock prices were up on
the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining about 200
points for the day. The Nasdaq index was up 90 points. By Richard

   USAIRWAYS-UNION (Undated) _ The unionized flight attendants at
US Airways are threatening an unusual walkout beginning this
Saturday _ they say they will disrupt 49 of the airline's busiest
routes. The flight attendants, who are waiting for a mandatory
30-day cooling off period to end at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, want to
maximize pressure on the company with a strategy they have dubbed
CHAOS _ Create Havoc Around Our System. In response, US Airways,
the nation's sixth-largest airline, plans to take an unusual step
of its own, saying that unless a contract is reached by Saturday,
it would suspend all its operations, rather than let the flight
attendants whipsaw the company and its customers. By Steven
Greenhouse.

HER OVEN BROKE THREE YEARS AGO, BUT SHE'S COOKIN' JUST FINE, THANK
YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARY ROGERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, my friend had no kitchen stove _ but she did have a
small child and a husband who expected to eat. ``How on earth do
you get away with having no cook stove?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy,'' she said. ``You've got to have a coffeepot, a
toaster and a hot plate. For breakfast you have coffee, toast,
boiled eggs or cereal.'' She counted the items off on her fingers.
``Lunch doesn't count because no one is home. At night you eat
refrigerator food _ that is, sandwich stuff _ or you go out,'' she
declared, dusting her hands together as if to remove excess flour.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't taken my culinary negligence that far, but three years
ago _ just before Thanksgiving _ my oven broke. It wasn't a
mountain-moving experience for my family. It meant only that until
we got a toaster oven, we couldn't have cheese toast for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   I've taken a page from my friend's book _ and another from the
restaurant guide, but that's another essay. I've got a range top,
an outdoor grill, a microwave, a coffeepot, a toaster oven and a
Crock-Pot. Who needs more?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I pop smoked sausage in the microwave, put some faux
baked beans on the range top to simmer, tear up a green salad, and
call it dinner. Frozen macaroni and cheese fresh from the microwave
is a good substitute for beans.
</P>
<P>
   A turkey breast or chicken from the grill is always a hit with
steamed broccoli and rice from the stove top. Ditto for pork
tenderloin marinated overnight and roasted on the grill with summer
squash and served with red beans cooked all day in the Crock-Pot.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I really miss is corn bread cooked in an iron
skillet. Iron skillets are too large to fit into toaster ovens, but
I still have corn bread, made from a package and baked in a cake
tin in the toaster oven.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to grill meat outside and to steam veggies inside.
</P>
<P>
   My broken oven was much more traumatic for my neighbor. She's a
wonderful, imaginative cook. Occasionally, when she'd have a big
group, she'd borrow my oven. She kept our house key, and it was
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   We were out of town the day she came unwound. It was
Thanksgiving, and she had a large family gathering at her place.
When she ran out of oven space for her justly famous artichoke
casserole, she popped over to our house and slid the casserole into
my cantankerous oven.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that sly oven pretended to work. Its control lights
blinked on, but as soon as she shut the front door, that hateful
oven snapped off again. When she returned an hour later, the
casserole was still as cold as a wedge _ and she was in a 4-foot
hover, wondering how she'd get it hot enough to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she has installed new appliances and even
added an extra oven to her kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   My oven is still broken, and I'm in no burnin' hurry to fix it.
Here are some recipes that may not be fancy, but they're oven-free,
and ones my family likes.
</P>
<P>
   Try the chicken once, and you'll do it again. If you have an
oven, you can do this in an oven-browning bag. Bake for about 45
minutes at 350 degrees. Of course, I don't have an oven, so if I
have all day, I do it in a Crock-Pot; if my time is shorter, I do
it on the range top or in an electric skillet, cooking until the
chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Do you like zucchini?
Mushrooms? They make nice additions.
STUPID CHICKEN
Serves 4 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts 28-ounce can
Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes 1 envelope Lipton Recipe Secrets

<P>
   Cut chicken into bite-size pieces. Mix raw chicken, tomatoes and
Recipe Secrets together, and pour into Crock-Pot. Cook on low for 6
to 8 hours.

   Once, my husband complained that I hadn't prepared a venison
back strap that was in the freezer. I took it to the chef at
Saint-Emilion, and on a Saturday night, he prepared it for us _ and
four guests. My husband has never again asked me to fix venison,
but here's a stew I like to make. I modified this recipe from one I
found years ago in ``Bon Appetit'' magazine.
REDNECK MARY'S VENISON STEW

Stew: 11/2 cups dried pinto beans, rinsed 2 pounds boneless chuck
roast, well-trimmed and cut into 11/2-inch pieces 2 pounds venison
roast cut the same way (if you don't like venison or don't have it,
use more beef) Salt and pepper, to taste 3 tablespoons all-purpose
flour 6 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large onion chopped 6 garlic
cloves, minced 1 jalapeno, minced with seeds 6-ounce can tomato
paste 12-ounce bottle beer 15-ounce can beef stock 15-ounce can
chicken stock 28-ounce can diced tomatoes with roasted garlic 1/2

<P>
   Cover beans with water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and
let stand 1 hour. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Place beef and venison in a large bowl. Season with salt and
pepper and sprinkle with the seasoning mixture; toss and add flour
to coat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in heavy Dutch oven and brown meat in batches.
</P>
<P>
   Toss onion with all but 2 or 3 teaspoons of remaining seasoning
mix and add to pan. Add garlic. Cook until almost tender. Add
jalapeno, tomato paste and beer. Stir 1 minute, scrapping up
browned bits.
</P>
<P>
   Add stocks, tomatoes and red pepper flakes. (If you're using a
Crock-Pot, now's the time to put it into the slow cooker along with
the rest of the seasoning mix and the beans. Let it cook all day, 6
to 8 hours, on low.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're cooking on the range top, reduce heat, cover and
simmer for 30 minutes. Add beans and simmer for an additional 45
minutes. Uncover, add remaining seasonings and cook until beans are
tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Saute diced poblano chiles until crisp-tender and stir into
stew. Ladle into bowls. Pass crusty bread.

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Years ago, I was given a crepe pan. It was a
hand-me-down, and it looked like one. I've grown to love it. And
I've used it for lots of things _ sauteing mushrooms, searing duck,
simmering onions. About the only thing I haven't used it for is
crepes.
</P>
<P>
   It has an unusually elegant shape, a slender-handled, shallow
pan that lies like an open palm. It is a little thinner than a
regular saute pan. Made of dense steel, it holds heat very well and
like cast iron is great for browning. And when it is a seasoned
hand-me-down, it acts like a nonstick pan.
</P>
<P>
   The shallow cooking surface also traps less moisture in the pan,
which is why it is perfect for crepes. When the batter hits the
pan, it immediately begins cooking and puffing and developing a
scattering of tiny rings on the surface where air bubbles form.
</P>
<P>
   But those design features also make it ideal for cooking many
other foods. Though I've used my crepe pan liberally already, last
week I tested to see what limits the pan might have. There were
none.
</P>
<P>
   It worked beautifully with shellfish like scallops and rock
shrimp, which need to be seared with lightning speed, so that they
brown without overcooking. The pan's surface, seven and a half
inches across, is the perfect size for searing scallops for four
people. And the sides of the pan are in perfect proportion to the
tiny pieces of shellfish. Rather than steaming or stewing or simply
burning as they would in a high pot, they began browning
immediately and their juices vaporized instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The pan had the same effect on a thin fillet of shad. The fish
cooked halfway through and browned well in about one minute. When I
turned it, the gently sloping, shallow sides had another advantage.
It was much easier to get at the fillet with a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   This was especially helpful when I made a thin omelet. Turning
it took no effort, no wrestling with a hot, heavy pan. The crepe
pan feels like a badminton racket compared with many saute pans.
</P>
<P>
   The crepe pan really charmed me though, when I treated it like a
shallow gratin dish. Often, gratin recipes require you to begin on
the stove, then transfer the dish to the oven. This can be a
difficult maneuver with a small-handled dish, potholders and a hot
oven.
</P>
<P>
   Also, gratin dishes tend to be deep, and I don't always want
potato gratins or fruit crumbles that are more than an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   In my crepe pan, I made a potato tart, slicing the potatoes as
thin as subway tokens and layering them in circles over the base of
the pan. I made just two layers and browned the bottom on the
stove, then finished the tart in the oven. Beginning over the stove
browned and crisped the potatoes. All I had to do was grab the long
handle to swing the pan into the oven.
</P>
<P>
   The real test came when the potatoes were done. I had to invert
the tart onto a plate so that the golden-browned surface, with its
carefully arranged layers of potato, would be on top. With a deep
pan or gratin dish, you must invert the pan and hope the tart stays
intact as it falls onto the plate. But with the crepe pan, the
potato tart simply shifted from pan to plate.
</P>
<P>
   A tarte Tatin benefited from this pan, too. Again, the handle
made it much easier to move around, and the depth of the pan
imposed a natural limit on the thickness of the tart. I had to cut
the apples smaller, but the resulting tart came out just as
beautifully caramelized as the classic.
</P>
<P>
   I then made a Provencal tart with eggplant, tomatoes and
zucchini. This time, I made just a single layer, alternating very
thin slices of the vegetables, and standing them up so they just
reached the rim of the pan. I wanted each serving to be like a thin
slice of terrine.
</P>
<P>
   I started the tart on the stove, then finished it in the oven.
The vegetables wilted and the liquid cooked off; they were like a
concentrate of their former selves. The tart was soft-looking and
browned on the edges like a rustic dish emerging from a
wood-burning oven. I could not think of a single reason to transfer
them to a serving dish. They seemed to belong in that old crepe pan
of mine.
</P>
<P>
   The crepe pan has a diminutive relative, the blini pan, which is
about four inches in diameter. It is also a gem. The pan happens to
be the perfect size for individual servings, and like the crepe
pan, this sturdy, wee pan can also become part of the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither pan is a big investment. They are possibly the cheapest
pans in a cookware store. The De Buyer nine-inch steel crepe pan is
$14.98, the De Buyer four-inch steel blini pan is $6.98, both at
Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THIN POTATO TART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   8 baby Yukon Gold potatoes (8 to 10 ounces), washed and sliced
thin
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place a 9-inch crepe pan over
medium-low heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil. When butter
foams, layer potatoes: place one slice in center of pan, then lay
slices overlapping one another, in circles, until you reach edge of
pan. Season generously with salt.
</P>
<P>
   2. On second layer, simply cover first layer in any arrangement
(you may not need all the slices). Season with salt and pepper. Dot
with remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cook on stove top until potatoes are browned on bottom.
Adjust heat if necessary; potatoes should not stew or burn. Press
on potatoes with a spatula to compress lightly. Cover pan with foil
and transfer to oven. After 5 minutes remove foil. When potatoes
are cooked through and crisp on the edges, about 10 minutes more,
remove from oven.
</P>
<P>
   4. Carefully run a thin spatula around the edge of the pan to
loosen. Place a heatproof serving plate on top of pan. Holding the
pan with one hand and the plate with the other, carefully invert
pan. Lift pan slowly, peeking to see if any potatoes are stuck. If
so, gently loosen with spatula and place where they belong.
Sprinkle tart with salt and pepper, and serve. &QL;

 &HT;    CENSUS ADS ARE WORKING, POLL SHOWS
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The advertising campaign to promote the 2000 census
is working, according to a poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said the poll shows that more
than 90 percent of Americans were familiar with the process even
before census forms reached their homes, and three of four
Americans were ready to mail back their questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Prewitt said the actual count is
proceeding well, with 7.3 million forms already processed. Forms
have been sent to 120 million households in the once-a-decade head
count.
</P>
<P>
   The visibility of the census took another leap Tuesday when it
became an issue in the presidential race. At an appearance in New
York, Vice President Al Gore criticized Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas for failing to support the use of population estimates to
bolster traditionally undercounted minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats support the practice of statistical sampling to
achieve what demographers believe is a more accurate census, while
Republicans oppose the statistical method. Many people believe that
most of the uncounted are poor and minority people, who tend to
vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The political debate will not cast a shadow over the Census
Bureau's efforts to convince Americans to participate, Prewitt said
in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The national advertising campaign and grassroots effort to
promote the census is so strong ``that our message will swamp other
messages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Census Bureau has used paid advertising
to promote the head count, a $167 million campaign that includes
prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results showed that 25 percent of Americans had seen a
census TV commercial at least 10 times, and 75 percent were aware
that the census determines the distribution of federal money to
state and local governments, a key theme of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in early March by InterSurvey and
financed by a consortium of non-profit foundations. The final poll
results assessing the promotional campaign will be released in
early April.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/USA Today poll by Gallup in late February showed that 74
percent of Americans were aware of the census and that 37 percent
had seen the television ads.

   HALHOUL, West Bank _ In this quiet town near Hebron, a newspaper
danced in the wind down the main street Tuesday morning, an elderly
man in a red-checked kaffiyeh rode his donkey and a few teenagers
whizzed along on bicycles. There was no air of expectation, no
feeling that a long-awaited moment had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, this was the day that Halhoul, after 33 years
under Israeli occupation, was to become fully Palestinian, give or
take a few acres. On the other, Halhoul had heard that promise
before, and the residents had decorated and un-decorated their
streets so many times that they were not going to hoist the flags
until the first Palestinian police jeep pulled into town.
</P>
<P>
   But indeed, Halhoul was ``liberated'' Tuesday, in the words of
the Palestinians. With about 20,000 residents, it was one of the
largest towns that Israel transferred to Palestinian control. After
a two-month delay that froze peace negotiations entirely, the
long-awaited handover of 6.1 percent of the West Bank _ or 132
square miles _ took place quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Later, peace talks resumed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer did not include Arab towns adjacent to Jerusalem,
for which the Palestinians had been pushing. It consisted of a
hodgepodge of areas throughout the West Bank, near Hebron, Nablus,
Jericho, Ramallah and Bethlehem. As of Tuesday, some 43 percent of
the West Bank, and most of the Palestinian population, lies under
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   As in Halhoul, most of the transfer involved territory that has
been under mixed control and has now become fully Palestinian.
About 1 percent of the West Bank moved from total Israeli to total
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Beituniya, a village near Ramallah, Palestinian police rode
into town firing their rifles in joy. But in Halhoul, the
Palestinian forces did not arrive, and no Israeli soldiers pulled
out, since they had been stationed at a regional command post. So
the big moment lacked a sense of reality. Municipal officials, who
were confused, could not even get any Palestinian Authority
officials on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of this moment _ 4:30 p.m. _ nobody has informed the
municipality what's happening,'' said Deputy Mayor Mohammed Mashal.
``On several occasions in the past, we prepared ourselves for
celebrations and _ nothing. This time, we are waiting for them to
arrive, hopefully tomorrow, in order to express our feelings of
liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul, which connects to Hebron by a bridge, now creates a
land block of Palestinian territorial contiguity, one of the goals
of Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. But the highway under the
bridge remains in Israeli hands, which means that a few acres of
precious land did not get transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are a little disappointed,'' said Walid Aburayyan, 32.
``But, look, it will be a joy to have them out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why the Palestinian Authority did not make a
concerted effort to plan celebrations for the handover, as they
have in the past. It is possible that Palestinian officials are
just too busy preparing for Pope John Paul II's day in Bethlehem on
Wednesday. It is possible that they did not want to call attention
to what they failed to get from the Israelis _ villages abutting
Jerusalem. It is possible that they were inept at milking the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature, suggested
that they were focused on what lies ahead. ``What happened was an
achievement,'' he said. ``But we were supposed to get this land for
some time now. The most important thing is what comes next: the
third redeployment and the final status negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   There was limited protest from Jewish settlers Tuesday, some of
whom have complained that the withdrawal endangers them by placing
more responsibility for West Bank security on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Sneeh, Israel's deputy defense minister, has said that
he thinks their fear is unwarranted, especially given new and
effective cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians in cracking
down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time that Arafat's guns were aimed, they were aimed
at Hamas terrorists,'' he said.

CHARRO TO SHARE ART, SKILLS AT EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The last time Jerry Diaz performed for Fort
Worth audiences, he had them standing in the aisles applauding his
skill with a horse and a rope. This weekend, his act will be more
subdued, but no less engaging.
</P>
<P>
   He is a featured speaker at Horse-O-Rama, a three-day equine
program offered by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service of
Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we are targeting the Hispanic audience,'' said John
South of the extension service. ``We know there is a lot of
interest in horses among the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is a fourth generation ``charro'' _ a precursor to, and
faint relative of, the American rodeo cowboy. He is devoted to his
craft and a spokesman for thousands of Hispanic horsemen who enjoy
celebrating their past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional skills of the ``charro'' are very important to
me,'' Diaz explained on his last visit. ``I feel very lucky to be
able to take these skills and put them in front of so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz received standing ovations during his 1997 Stock Show
performances, something unusual for rodeo specialty acts. The
tributes were as much for his bearing as his talents. He looked
regal in his ``traje de charro,'' a snug, wheat-colored uniform
made of gabardine, and his broad-brimmed sombrero.
</P>
<P>
   He later explained to a San Antonio newspaper: ``It's about
being well-mounted so it looks like it's all one _ you, the horse,
the outfit and the heart. It's very romantic controlling the horse
and at the same time doing it with pride, honor and beauty. That's
the discipline of the horsemanship.''
</P>
<P>
   His great-grandfather was a horseman in Spain. His grandfather
settled in Mexico, in the state of Jalisco near Guadalajara, around
the turn of the century. He was a respected horseman but lost
everything in the Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's father, Pepe, went to Mexico City to train horses for the
government, becoming the personal trainer for Mexico's president,
Lazaro Cardenas. In the late 1930s, Pepe Diaz crossed the border
into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Diaz was born in 1960, northwest of San Antonio. By the
age of 2 or 3, he earned nickels and dimes by standing on the backs
of horses and singing. At 5, he made his first professional
performance at a local rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has devoted himself to the art and skills of the
``charro''. He was named 1998 Specialty Act of the Year by the
Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association; he performed at the
Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he will forgo the arena and spotlight in exchange
for a classroom setting at the Will Rogers Equestrian Center where
he can tell his Fort Worth audience about the lariat _ ``la
reata.'' He'll explain the development of chaps (''chaparreras)''
and spurs ``(espuelas).'' He'll follow the evolution of the
``vaquero'', the ``charro'' and eventually the cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers will discuss the development of the horse over
the past 2,000 years. ``We'll go back to the Roman Empire, then to
the New World,'' South said. ``We want this to be a real learning
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Other educational presentations include a cavalry re-enactment,
sessions on cutting, roping and dressage. There will also be an
all-breed horse show and classes on equine health and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 14th annual Horse-O-Rama and the largest. South said
the program has grown along with horse ownership in Tarrant County.
It is estimated that horses represent an $80 million industry in
the county based just on keep and maintenance. Figuring in the
annual shows that come to Fort Worth _ the Stock Show, the NCHA
Futurity and the APHA World Show among them _ the economic impact
soars to more than $500 million.
</P>

 &HT;    BUSH SHOULD COURT McCAIN, GOP POLLSTER SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After analyzing research from three Republican
primary states, Republican pollster Frank Luntz offered some
unsolicited advice Tuesday to Gov. George W. Bush: Wrap John McCain
in a ``bear hug'' and don't let go.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does not win two-thirds of the McCain vote in the
general election, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee
will lose the White House to Vice President Al Gore, Luntz warned.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters, Luntz reviewed his findings from
focus groups of McCain voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina and
New York, concluding that these independent-minded voters are the
``swing vote'' in this year's presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can't afford to wait until the GOP convention in late July
to make peace with McCain, Luntz said. ``Bush needs to bear-hug
McCain now and take him with him so that McCain and Bush share the
platform and speak out together.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, a veteran senator from Arizona, has made it
clear he is not interested in being the Texas governor's running
mate, Luntz said Bush should try to convince him to join the
Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Gore is already reaching out to McCain voters the
way President Clinton did to Ross Perot voters in 1992. But the
Bush camp is criticizing McCain the way Republican Party leaders
did Perot in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is repeating itself,'' said Luntz, who was a pollster
for Perot before the Texas billionaire halted his independent White
House bid in 1992. Perot eventually re-entered the 1992 race, but
by then, much of the enthusiasm for Perot's candidacy had shifted
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said he has been puzzled by Bush's unwillingness to make
any overtures to McCain. He compared Bush's attitude to the
disastrous position taken by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
following the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see an analogy? Gingrich '94,'' said Luntz, the
pollster behind Gingrich's ``Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The man destroyed himself hours out of the box by talking
about how irrelevant Bill Clinton was, how the Republicans now ran
Washington and basically flexing his political muscle to the point
of offending the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz suggested that such GOP notables as former party chairman
Haley Barbour and former congressman Vin Weber meet privately with
Bush and McCain to make peace within the party.

`I WILL BEAR WITNESS': A VICTIM'S SANG-FROID IN COLD-BLOODED
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDITORS: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the first entries of his diaries of 1942 to 1945,
Victor Klemperer tells of riding the tram in Dresden and being told
by a young man _ ``very clean-cut face, cold gray eyes'' _ to get
off at the next stop. He is taken to the Gestapo, where he is
humiliated and insulted and told to keep off the tram from now on,
or else. Klemperer's last entry, three and a half years and a
lifetime of anguish later, is a simple declarative sentence about
his return on foot to the house that he and his wife, Eva, had
bought outside Dresden before the war broke out.
</P>
<P>
   In between are the years of terror and deprivation, the daily
torment of survival as a Jew in Nazi Germany. ``I Will Bear
Witness,'' Volume II, translated and abridged by Martin Chalmers,
is an even more striking, more emotionally vivid account of the
Nazi years than Volume I, which covered the years 1933 to 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The first volume, published in the United States in 1998, was a
kind of grim prelude, one in which Klemperer, a thoroughly
assimilated, patriotic German Jew who taught Romance languages at
the Dresden Technical University, described the slow, terrifying
collapse of his country into barbarism. This second volume treats
the worst years of the Nazi era: the mass deportations of Jews, the
stints of forced labor, the near-starvation, the Allied bombings,
the alternating stages of hope and depression as the German war
effort weakened and recovered over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the Klemperer diaries stand as an unparalleled
and intimate record from the innards of the beast. What makes them
unparalleled is the thunderous accumulation of the small details
that escape standard historical accounts _ the psychology of
wearing the yellow star, the effort to face Gestapo interrogations
with courage, the anti-Semitic taunts of children on the street,
the ban on having clothes washed in ``Aryan'' laundries. Then, at
the very end, comes what is perhaps the most remarkable part in
this monumental two-volume work. It is Klemperer's account of the
phantasmagorical few weeks before and after the German surrender,
when he and his wife, in a grim, necessary bid to survive,
underwent a harrowing Odyssean journey through the physical and
spiritual wreckage of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Klemperer was born in Landsberg an der Warthe, now Gorzow
Wielkopolski in Poland, in 1881, the son of a rabbi who soon took
his family to Berlin. He studied philosophy, philology and Romance
languages in Munich, Geneva, Paris and Berlin and embarked on an
academic career, the early highlight of which was a two-volume
study of Montesquieu. He married a non-Jew and became a Protestant,
which is what gave him the ``privileged'' status that saved his
life during the war.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Klemperer remained in Dresden, which became part
of East Germany, and resumed his career as a professor and a
scholar. He died in Dresden in 1960. His diaries, which were at one
time believed lost, were published in Germany in 1996, to enormous
public interest and acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the events and themes crowded into this second volume
illustrate the absurdist deformations that the Nazi regime imposed
on those in Germany who clung to a shred of decency. ``Don't say
that we treated you well,'' his Aryan anti-Nazi supervisor warns
him during the winter when Klemperer, 60 years old and suffering
from angina pectoris, is made to shovel snow for eight or nine
hours a day. ``Rather say we were bad; otherwise we'll be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Klemperer notes with a kind of resigned outrage that
Jews have been banned from buying flowers. The Jews are prohibited
from entering the railway station. They are not allowed to use
their bicycles to make visits on Sundays. ``I only go out on the
street if it is absolutely necessary,'' Klemperer writes in May
1942.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries record the full range of human responses to
circumstances of great duress, including acts of kindness by
ordinary Germans that make Klemperer reject the view, common among
his friends, that the entire country and culture is anti-Semitic.
In 1942, Klemperer is approached by two gray-haired women on the
street. They shake his hand. ``You know why,'' one of them says,
and rushes off. A friend named Frau Pick in 1943 is summoned to the
Gestapo, which she knows means almost certain deportation. ``She
had had a good life, and now it was over,'' she says calmly, and
then kills herself.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1943, Klemperer is given a cigarette packet full of
teeth so that one can be used to replace a missing one for his
wife. ``Secret teeth from the Jewish cemetery,'' he writes. ``It
sounds as gruesome as a fairy tale, but it is crazy enough even in
reality.'' Then the ``Aryan'' trustee of his weekend house in the
Dresden suburbs, a man named Richter, offers to hide Klemperer and
his wife if the order comes for him to be deported. When Richter
himself is arrested, he instructs his secretary to give Klemperer
some money. ``That in his desperate situation the man has thought
of us!'' Klemperer exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer is continually astonished at the amazing reach of
Germany's anti-Semitic paranoia, to the point that when the Allied
invasion in Normandy takes place, the headline in the Dresdener
Zeitung is ``Jews in Normandy.'' Klemperer takes hope from the
landing and in Soviet advances on the Eastern front, but at the
same time he records the slow disappearance of Dresden's remaining
Jews. He does what amounts to slave labor in a factory, and one day
without warning three Jewish men are taken out and, it is reported,
shot. ``A moment ago I was in constant contact with these three
people, and now they are buried. And tomorrow my fate may be the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, with the war almost over, Dresden was firebombed by the
Allies with devastating results, but for Klemperer, whose
description of the attack is densely vivid, it is a reprieve. The
next day it appeared that the ``privileged'' Jews were going to be
deported. But the chaos of the bombing saved him, though it also
sent him and Eva on a desperate journey from town to town that
didn't end until several weeks after the German surrender.
</P>
<P>
   There is an enormous amount to read in this volume, but it is
difficult to put down. Not least of its elements is Klemperer's own
expressed awareness that, if the diary were to be discovered in one
of the many routine police searches that were carried out, it would
surely mean his death. ``But I shall go on writing,'' Klemperer
says on May 27, 1942. ``That is my heroism. I will bear witness,
precise witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just witness, but precise witness, a German trait. And in
this instance, rare, illuminating and priceless.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the surface, it is not one of nature's most
beautiful creations: a bumpy, blotchy thick skin encasing a pale,
seedy yellow pulp.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of a sour orange is revealed in the kitchen, where it
is every bit as appealing as a lemon or a lime, but with a spicy,
flowery fragrance like no other citrus. It can adapt to a wide
range of cuisines, melding savory and sweet flavors and perking
them up with an exotic, fruity tang.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicama in the Flatiron district in Manhattan, Douglas
Rodriguez uses sour orange juice in traditional Ecuadorean ceviches
and for marinating suckling pig. Marc Murphy pairs Seville orange
chutney with vanilla custard at La Fourchette on the Upper East
Side. And at Eight Mile Creek in SoHo, Ken Addington bathes tuna in
sour orange juice and fish sauce before searing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a greener, wilder, almost salty citrus flavor,''
Addington said.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be new to New York chefs, the sour orange has been
used for generations in Latin America and the Caribbean in mojo,
the thin cooking sauce of sour orange juice, oil and garlic that is
prized for marinating stewed pork but also makes its way into
dishes from salad dressings to ceviches.
</P>
<P>
   The sour orange, originally native to Asia, is now grown in the
tropics and along the Gulf Coast, where it is considered wild and
almost valueless _ a nuisance when it unloads its bounty on the
lawn. Along the Mediterranean, where its cousin the Seville orange
grows, the rind is used in marmalades and candies.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, sour oranges can be found for about three for $1 at
some supermarkets and bodegas (they're often labeled ``naranja
agria''). Specialty markets like Gourmet Garage, Agata and
Valentina and Grace's Marketplace also carry them.
</P>
<P>
   We first bought sour oranges at a C-Town on Upper Broadway, and
they quickly became a magical presence in our kitchen, inspiring
weeks of experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   We went substitution-wild, replacing the lemon in our favorite
recipes with sour orange. Dressing a roast chicken with sour orange
gave the bird a subtle, fruity lift. A sour orange hollandaise we
made with two teaspoons of the juice had a more pronounced orange
flavor, especially when we tossed in a pinch of the zest.
</P>
<P>
   Our first attempt to revitalize the Key lime pie was a triumph.
Our second attempt was even better, with a tablespoon of navel
orange zest added for appearance's sake. Sour orange zest, which
contains most of the aromatic oils, with notes of gardenia blossoms
and honey, is an unfortunate yellow-gray color.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a bottled sour orange sauce, we infused
fresh-squeezed sour orange juice with fresh herbs and used the
liquid as we do balsamic vinegar, to deglaze pans and in salad
dressings. The mixtures are fun to concoct, and we discovered that
grassy, floral herbs like oregano, cilantro, thyme, and tarragon
best complement the juice.
</P>
<P>
   Now we keep three strengths on hand. The spiciest, made from
cilantro, slices of raw onion, garlic and serrano chile, makes a
knockout mojo. The next, a supercharged infusion of tarragon, can
be sprinkled over stewed greens like kale and chard for an elegant
top note. A third version, made with thyme and garlic, lends itself
to whisking with olive oil for a tropical vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   And the drinks! Perhaps the most satisfying way to experience
the sour orange _ the way that best reveals its distinction from a
lemon or a lime _ is in a cocktail. A pony of sour orange juice
dresses down a same-old gin and tonic.
</P>
<P>
   A mojito made with sour orange juice instead of lime is
transformed. And that mojito, modified into sour orange mojito
sorbet, has become our new favorite dessert, one that conjures warm
summer breezes even if it's still chilly outdoors. &QL;

`YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!: SPEAK FREELY BUT NOT ABOUT THOSE THINGS 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thursday night, John Stossel, ABC's scourge of the
left, goes after what he considers constraints on free speech in
the claimed interests of civility. ``You Can't Say That!'' wanders
a bit with asides on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's attempts to stop
marches and exhibits by groups he finds offensive, on efforts in
Congress to outlaw flag burning and on mainstream television's
restrictions on profanity, before it gets down to Stossel's real
subject: current tendencies on the once-permissive left to crack
down on what it deems racism or sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Stossel recalls a celebrated incident in which Miller beer fired
an employee for telling a female colleague a joke he had heard on
``Seinfeld,'' a show that the company sponsored. The woman
complained that she was offended. The point here is that
corporations are so frightened of being sued for sexual harassment
that they bow to charges, however slight or unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Miller explains, ``Once you've stepped over the
line that the other person believes is offensive, you have to
acknowledge it and back off.'' Otherwise, since offensiveness is
often treated by juries as being in the eye of the beholder, the
company risks having to pay substantial damages.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges have caved in, too, says Stossel. He tells of an
English professor at the State University of New York who was fired
for allowing rude words to be used in a writing exercise. A law
teacher at the University of California at Los Angeles asserts that
sexual harassment laws are forcing employers to become speech
police: ``These are the jokes you can't tell, these are the
opinions you can't express, these are the words you can't use.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that sounds like the stuff of a Nichols and May
routine, Stossel talks with a company consultant who earns her fees
giving employees ``sensitivity training,'' which she says means
``Don't talk about body parts, don't give people sexual attention
of any kind, whether you think they want it or not.'' Stossel
comments, ``People now compete to see who can be most offended,''
adding that the policy at many schools is ``to ban words that the
`sensitive' would consider offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, Ward Connerly, a conservative campaigner
against racial preferences, tells of repeatedly being shouted down
by university audiences. In answer to Stossel's question ``Who gave
you that power to decide for everybody?,'' a student at Columbia
University says, ``I'm taking the power by going out and
protesting: `Racist, get off my campus!'''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of making his case, Stossel sometimes loads it.
But this time out he forces viewers to ponder whether tolerance for
certain unpopular views, be it in offices or on campuses, is
becoming an endangered species.

`THEN CAME YOU': ROOM SERVICE? ONE ROMANCE, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best television series, it seems, come from
somebody's personal experience or vision. Like Linwood Boomer's
growing up as the smart one in a rowdy four-boy household, which
turned into ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' Or whatever it is that
inspired Chris Carter to create ``The X-Files,'' about FBI agents,
conspiracies and extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, viewers of the premiere of ABC's ``Then Came
You'' will see a personal experience of Betsy Thomas, a creator and
a co-executive producer of the show. After her divorce, Thomas
moved into the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles and fell in love with
her room service waiter. And that's exactly what happens to the
show's heroine, Billie (Susan Floyd), a book editor with great
hair. This, however, seems to be a case of life at its most
sitcomish to begin with. When it's officially turned into comedy,
the fact that it's real doesn't make it original.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, Billie, who is 33, is in her hotel room
celebrating her coming divorce. Just as her best female friend and
her best gay male friend are suggesting friends of theirs she
should go out with, room service arrives in the person of Aidan
(Thomas Newton). Banter begins. Billie learns that both she and
Aidan went to Northwestern. ``When did you graduate?'' she asks. He
answers, ``May.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first date happens almost by accident. That's the kind of
man she needs, Billie says to her friends, laughing. ``He's funny.
He's educated. He brings me things.'' And, Aidan quickly adds, ``He
gets off at midnight.'' Then there's the equivalent of the
happy-dating montage, this one to establish that the couple are
having, as another character later summarizes, ``seven days of
mind-bending sex.'' The rest is equally obvious. Billie announces
that she's a changed woman. (``Until I met you, I was the kind of
person who wouldn't go swimming until 30 minutes after I ate.'')
She worries that he can't afford to take her to dinner, and he's
offended. Her soon-to-be-ex-husband ridicules the relationship.
(``Is that what you meant when you said you wanted children?'')
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that Thomas and her co-creator, Jeff Strauss, have
made so many predictable choices. And that Floyd, while attractive
and personable, is so unconvincing as a woman fresh from a loveless
marriage who needs an awakening. The series also has a laugh track
that goes wild over lines like ``Wow, that was _ thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, Newton has considerable charm. And there is a
lot of real humor to be mined from the older-woman-younger-man
relationship. When Billie explains that she doesn't want to turn
into Robinson, Aidan says _ you guessed it _ ``Who?''

 &HT;    WIRED COMMUNITY USES NETWORK TO BRING NEIGHBORS TOGETHER

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ A stay-at-home mom, Kathy Verschoor sits
down daily at the family computer to stay in touch with her
toddler's play group, scan upcoming events at the nearby community
center and keep up on neighborhood concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Verschoor is no nerd. She knew little about computers and
the Internet until she and her husband, Scott, moved last year to
DC Ranch, a high-tech housing development taking shape in the
desert foothills on the northern fringes of Phoenix's urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a tool, and it helps people get to know each
other quicker and better,'' said Verschoor.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the personal-computing boom, real-estate developers and
architects across the country are collaborating on new
neighborhoods that feature high-speed connections marrying the
Internet, television and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   DC Ranch, with 200 homes occupied and another 6,000 slated for
construction, has made high-speed Internet connections a standard
feature of the houses it sells. Its quiet, cactus-studded streets
and upscale homes are wired with fiber optics and coaxial cable to
provide each household with at least two high-speed, ready-to-surf
Internet connections, six e-mail addresses, and digital TV and
telephones _ all for $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not intended as an exclusive haven for the pocket
protector crowd. The Arizona developers, DMB Associates, have taken
their technology a step further by encouraging the suburbanites to
use their computers to build personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   RanchNet, a password-protected internal community network, lets
residents find neighbors with common hobbies, organize Scout
meetings, sound off about neighborhood security and reserve tennis
courts at the community center. Soon, they'll also be able to
download their children's homework assignments, make medical
appointments, and order groceries on line.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, American communities will offer residents more
computerized power to organize their lives and save time.
</P>
<P>
   Will the spread of such technology turn America into a wired
wasteland?
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Stanford University researchers warned that
people who use the Internet as little as five hours a week were
less likely to have face-to-face contact with friends and family,
and were at risk of shutting themselves off from society.
</P>
<P>
   DC Ranch residents challenge that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a neighborhood where you knew all your neighbors.
But that was the '50s and '60s. Well, this is the same,'' said
Verschoor, 41. ``I want to be known to my neighbors, and the system
helps us do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both DC Ranch and Celebration, a similar trail-blazing community
developed by Disney near Orlando, try to integrate the Internet
into a movement that architects and planners have dubbed New
Urbanism or simply TND _ traditional neighborhood design. The goal
is to achieve a friendly community of small neighborhoods linked by
front porches, sidewalks, bike paths and small parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a community-building tool that allows neighbors to
build relationships more quickly,'' said Brent Herrington,
community manager of DC Ranch, who came to the Arizona project from
Celebration. ``This is intended to be a catalyst to get people out
of the house, not simply cocooning in front of the computer
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   While DC Ranch is aimed partly at telecommuters, more residents
are mere casual users of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   On the private RanchNet intranet, e-mail addresses consist of
first name, followed by a dot, then last name.
</P>
<P>
   An online community directory lets families publish their names,
children's ages, hobbies and other biographical information. Since
every resident is a newcomer, the intention is to encourage
contacts for activities beyond the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the items and topics posted recently on the
community's chat site: ``Upset about pool closing ... Need a dog
sitter ...Spring baseball tickets for sale ...Pokemon trading card
party.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Verschoors' 2-year-old daughter Sarah eventually heads
off to the new public elementary school being built at the edge of
DC Ranch, they will be able to check her grades on line and
download her homework. Already there's a parents' group meeting
regularly at the community center and keeping in touch through
RanchNet.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed connections and community system have changed the
way telecommuters Ed and Judy Bott work and play.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, in their 40s and childless, moved to DC Ranch last
year from Redmond, Wash., home of Microsoft Corp. He is an author
of books on computers and software. She is a public-relations
consultant to several Silicon Valley dot-com companies. They were
lured by the Arizona sunshine and the ability to seamlessly work
via the Net with clients hundreds or thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was a deal-breaker for us. If it didn't have
high-speed connections, we weren't interested,'' Ed Bott said of
their decision to buy at DC Ranch. ``Here, we're ahead of the
curve, and that's where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But the technology of DC Ranch offered an unexpected dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our first three months in this community we met more
neighbors than we did in three years in Redmond,'' he said. They
use RanchNet to keep in touch with the community's exercise club
and to sign up for nature walks into the nearby desert mountains.
</P>
<P>
   With one house and two fast Internet connections, they sometimes
find themselves e-mailing one another from their home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really geeky,'' admitted Judy Bott. ``As crazy as it
sounds, because we live in the same house sending e-mails is really
polite, because when you're both working you don't want to
interrupt the other by casually dropping in.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of American homes have high-speed Internet
connections. At the end of 1999, 36 million of the more than 102
million U.S. households had Internet connections, but only about
1.35 million were high-speed coaxial cable connections and fewer
than 600,000 were the upgraded phone lines known as DSL, according
to International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are rising rapidly, though. The concept of
pre-wired high-speed access is being replicated across the country,
from Atlanta's hot condominium market to apartment building
renovations in New York to golf communities in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it has become routine. We ask every client, 'Do you want
this wired?' `` said Eric Seugling, project manager for Brock Green
Architects and Planners in Atlanta, which is working on two wired
condo projects, the 130-unit Studio Plex on Auburn and the 120-unit
New Loft condominiums in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   North of Austin, Texas, the Avery Ranch master planned community
has signed a deal with ClearWorks.net to provide digital Internet,
video and telephone services to 2,000 single-family homes and 2,000
multi-family units.
</P>
<P>
   At DC Ranch, the telephone, TV and Internet services are
supplied by US West. The services are bundled, meaning one monthly
bill and unique features. For instance, the telephone's caller ID
system can be set to display on a TV or computer screen. The
integration also means that houses can be automated. Security
systems, climate control, lights and music can be controlled by a
computer or a switch panel on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Such houses are not cheap. Prices start at just under $300,000
and extend beyond $1 million for a custom-built home on an adjacent
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   One developer in Florida is planning a similar Internet
community with more affordable homes in the range of $113,000 to
$170,000. Houses at the development near Port St. Lucie, called St.
James Golf Club, will be interconnected like the ones at DC Ranch
and Celebration, said developer Paul Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic yearning to return to classic neighborhoods,
and that is what fuels these designs,'' said Rhodes. ``Do people
want it? We're going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, the experiment has worked at DC Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Verschoor, a business consultant whose office is a
45-minute commute to downtown Phoenix, the high-speed Internet
connection from home often saves him a long drive when work
requires his attention on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   As a tool, the community's Web site is sometimes as simple as
this: ``You know, you forget people's names and you don't want to
be rude,'' he says. ``Sometimes we go in just to find out the names
of the neighbors we met a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects and developers like the potentially lucrative idea of
making fast Internet connections as integral to the family home as
the telephone and cable TV are today. New homes are being designed
using standards once reserved for commercial office buildings, with
features like advanced and easily upgradable wiring and reinforced
roofs to accommodate satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are simply awakening to what telecommunications and
retail companies have realized at every phase of the Internet's
evolution _ that people simply like to communicate with each
other,'' said Stephen Doheny-Farina, author of the 1997 book ``The
Wired Neighborhood'' and a professor of technical communications at
Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are selling are people-to-people connections,'' he
said.

construction, has made high-speed Internet connections a standard
feature of the houses it sells. Its quiet, cactus-studded streets
and upscale homes are wired with fiber optics and coaxial cable to
provide each household with at least two high-speed, ready-to-surf
Internet connections, six e-mail addresses, and digital TV and
telephones _ all for $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not intended as an exclusive haven for the pocket
protector crowd. The Arizona developers, DMB Associates, have taken
their technology a step further by encouraging the suburbanites to
use their computers to build personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   RanchNet, a password-protected internal community network, lets
residents find neighbors with common hobbies, organize Scout
meetings, sound off about neighborhood security and reserve tennis
courts at the community center. Soon, they'll also be able to
download their children's homework assignments, make medical
appointments, and order groceries on line.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, American communities will offer residents more
computerized power to organize their lives and save time.
</P>
<P>
   Will the spread of such technology turn America into a wired
wasteland?
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Stanford University researchers warned that
people who use the Internet as little as five hours a week were
less likely to have face-to-face contact with friends and family,
and were at risk of shutting themselves off from society.
</P>
<P>
   DC Ranch residents challenge that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a neighborhood where you knew all your neighbors.
But that was the '50s and '60s. Well, this is the same,'' said
Verschoor, 41. ``I want to be known to my neighbors, and the system
helps us do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both DC Ranch and Celebration, a similar trail-blazing community
developed by Disney near Orlando, try to integrate the Internet
into a movement that architects and planners have dubbed New
Urbanism or simply TND _ traditional neighborhood design. The goal
is to achieve a friendly community of small neighborhoods linked by
front porches, sidewalks, bike paths and small parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a community-building tool that allows neighbors to
build relationships more quickly,'' said Brent Herrington,
community manager of DC Ranch, who came to the Arizona project from
Celebration. ``This is intended to be a catalyst to get people out
of the house, not simply cocooning in front of the computer
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   While DC Ranch is aimed partly at telecommuters, more residents
are mere casual users of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   On the private RanchNet intranet, e-mail addresses consist of
first name, followed by a dot, then last name.
</P>
<P>
   An online community directory lets families publish their names,
children's ages, hobbies and other biographical information. Since
every resident is a newcomer, the intention is to encourage
contacts for activities beyond the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the items and topics posted recently on the
community's chat site: ``Upset about pool closing ... Need a dog
sitter ...Spring baseball tickets for sale ...Pokemon trading card
party.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Verschoors' 2-year-old daughter Sarah eventually heads
off to the new public elementary school being built at the edge of
DC Ranch, they will be able to check her grades on line and
download her homework. Already there's a parents' group meeting
regularly at the community center and keeping in touch through
RanchNet.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed connections and community system have changed the
way telecommuters Ed and Judy Bott work and play.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, in their 40s and childless, moved to DC Ranch last
year from Redmond, Wash., home of Microsoft Corp. He is an author
of books on computers and software. She is a public-relations
consultant to several Silicon Valley dot-com companies. They were
lured by the Arizona sunshine and the ability to seamlessly work
via the Net with clients hundreds or thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was a deal-breaker for us. If it didn't have
high-speed connections, we weren't interested,'' Ed Bott said of
their decision to buy at DC Ranch. ``Here, we're ahead of the
curve, and that's where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But the technology of DC Ranch offered an unexpected dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our first three months in this community we met more
neighbors than we did in three years in Redmond,'' he said. They
use RanchNet to keep in touch with the community's exercise club
and to sign up for nature walks into the nearby desert mountains.
</P>
<P>
   With one house and two fast Internet connections, they sometimes
find themselves e-mailing one another from their home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really geeky,'' admitted Judy Bott. ``As crazy as it
sounds, because we live in the same house sending e-mails is really
polite, because when you're both working you don't want to
interrupt the other by casually dropping in.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of American homes have high-speed Internet
connections. At the end of 1999, 36 million of the more than 102
million U.S. households had Internet connections, but only about
1.35 million were high-speed coaxial cable connections and fewer
than 600,000 were the upgraded phone lines known as DSL, according
to International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are rising rapidly, though. The concept of
pre-wired high-speed access is being replicated across the country,
from Atlanta's hot condominium market to apartment building
renovations in New York to golf communities in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it has become routine. We ask every client, 'Do you want
this wired?' `` said Eric Seugling, project manager for Brock Green
Architects and Planners in Atlanta, which is working on two wired
condo projects, the 130-unit Studio Plex on Auburn and the 120-unit
New Loft condominiums in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   North of Austin, Texas, the Avery Ranch master planned community
has signed a deal with ClearWorks.net to provide digital Internet,
video and telephone services to 2,000 single-family homes and 2,000
multi-family units.
</P>
<P>
   At DC Ranch, the telephone, TV and Internet services are
supplied by US West. The services are bundled, meaning one monthly
bill and unique features. For instance, the telephone's caller ID
system can be set to display on a TV or computer screen. The
integration also means that houses can be automated. Security
systems, climate control, lights and music can be controlled by a
computer or a switch panel on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Such houses are not cheap. Prices start at just under $300,000
and extend beyond $1 million for a custom-built home on an adjacent
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   One developer in Florida is planning a similar Internet
community with more affordable homes in the range of $113,000 to
$170,000. Houses at the development near Port St. Lucie, called St.
James Golf Club, will be interconnected like the ones at DC Ranch
and Celebration, said developer Paul Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic yearning to return to classic neighborhoods,
and that is what fuels these designs,'' said Rhodes. ``Do people
want it? We're going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, the experiment has worked at DC Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Verschoor, a business consultant whose office is a
45-minute commute to downtown Phoenix, the high-speed Internet
connection from home often saves him a long drive when work
requires his attention on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   As a tool, the community's Web site is sometimes as simple as
this: ``You know, you forget people's names and you don't want to
be rude,'' he says. ``Sometimes we go in just to find out the names
of the neighbors we met a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects and developers like the potentially lucrative idea of
making fast Internet connections as integral to the family home as
the telephone and cable TV are today. New homes are being designed
using standards once reserved for commercial office buildings, with
features like advanced and easily upgradable wiring and reinforced
roofs to accommodate satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are simply awakening to what telecommunications and
retail companies have realized at every phase of the Internet's
evolution _ that people simply like to communicate with each
other,'' said Stephen Doheny-Farina, author of the 1997 book ``The
Wired Neighborhood'' and a professor of technical communications at
Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are selling are people-to-people connections,'' he
said.

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ A stay-at-home mom, Kathy Verschoor sits
down daily at the family computer to stay in touch with her
toddler's play group, scan upcoming events at the nearby community
center and keep up on neighborhood concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Verschoor is no nerd. She knew little about computers and
the Internet until she and her husband, Scott, moved last year to
DC Ranch, a high-tech housing development taking shape in the
desert foothills on the northern fringes of Phoenix's urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a tool, and it helps people get to know each
other quicker and better,'' said Verschoor.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the personal-computing boom, real-estate developers and
architects across the country are collaborating on new
neighborhoods that feature high-speed connections marrying the
Internet, television and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   DC Ranch, with 200 homes occupied and another 6,000 slated for
construction, has made high-speed Internet connections a standard
feature of the houses it sells. Its quiet, cactus-studded streets
and upscale homes are wired with fiber optics and coaxial cable to

 &HT;    EDs: Resending from Saturday, with updates about Al-Amin being
arrested
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A violent, inspiring, puzzling life
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thirty-five years and two names ago, the man who would
become famous as H. Rap Brown had a very different kind of brush
with police.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was working with an anti-poverty program in a Washington,
D.C., neighborhood where there had been clashes between police and
residents. Considering his later notoriety as a violence-preaching
Black Panther, Brown's response to the problem was calm and
common-sensical: He wanted to talk to the white police captain in
charge about cultural sensitivity in patrolling a black area.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke for an hour. The captain was so impressed with the
young man that he suggested Brown might want to consider a future
in law enforcement and take the police exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a wonderful moment. I really felt there could be
progress,'' one of Brown's co-workers, Charles Puttkammer, who was
at the meeting, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin _ Brown's name for the past
quarter-century _ was captured in White Hall, Ala., after an
exchange of gunfire with federal marshals, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been searching for Al-Amin since Thursday, March 16,
when two Fulton County sheriff's deputies were shot while trying to
serve an arrest warrant in Atlanta's West End.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Richard Kinchen, 35, died of his wounds; Deputy Aldranon
English, 28, is recovering from his injuries at Grady Memorial
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As Hubert Gerold Brown, an angry son of the segregated South, he
grew up to embody the black power movement of the '60s. He wore
dark sunglasses and a black beret and became infamous for saying
things like, ``Violence is as American as cherry pie.'' Eventually,
he was indicted for inciting a riot and convicted for taking part
in a shoot-out with New York City police.
</P>
<P>
   As Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, he came out of prison with a new
religion, a new name and a new home on a tree-shaded street near
the Atlanta University Center. He opened a small grocery store that
smelled of incense and founded a mosque that helped clean up a
crime-plagued neighborhood. At 56, his musk-oiled beard turning
gray, he was a familiar figure on West End Place, where he was
still known to unfold his 6-foot-5 frame in basketball games with
neighborhood kids.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings Thursday, his neighbors had trouble
reconciling the conflicting images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him angry,'' said 73-year-old Hattie Stegall, who
lives nearby. ``When someone would die in my family, he would come
by and offer his hand. And when the Muslim children would fight my
grandchildren, he would make them come to me and apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Stegall's daughter, Susie Sykes, said she has known Al-Amin for
20 years. She said they talked about religion or health but never
about his past. For years, she said, ``A lot of us didn't know he
was H. Rap Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Brown _ the ``Rap'' nickname came during the '60s _ was
born during World War II to a petroleum worker and his wife in
Baton Rouge, La. In his 1969 autobiography, ``Die Nigger Die!''
Brown wrote that he had developed a sense of outrage over racial
injustice even as a child. He said he was always arguing with
teachers about prejudice in the works of white writers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown enrolled at Southern University in 1960 and was majoring
in sociology. He made good grades and left no record of
troublemaking, but left his hometown school before graduating.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Washington and enlisted in the War on Poverty,
working for a neighborhood development center called the United
Planning Organization. Charles Puttkammer, the former co-worker in
that program, remembers him as an energetic advocate for the poor,
even when he had needs of his own. ``He asked me to co-sign on a
loan for a car. ... It was a used Pontiac.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown soon soured on the federal poverty program. He later
wrote that ``it was designed to take those people whom the
government considered threatening and buy them off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Brown jumped into the front lines of the civil rights
movement as a field organizer for the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee in Greene County, Ala. SNCC, which had been
founded during the sit-in movement of the early '60s, was in
turmoil. Militant activists like Stokley Carmichael were pushing
out many of the group's more conciliatory founders _ Julian Bond
and John Lewis, among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have the most developed, thought-out ideas in the
world, but like Stokley, he knew how to work a crowd,'' Lewis said
of Brown in his memoir, ``Walking With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   His opportunity to show those skills came in 1967, when the
controversial Carmichael was ousted as SNCC chairman and the post
was given to Brown, who was thought to be more moderate. But
Carmichael knew that his successor was at least as militant as he
was. ``You'll be happy to have me back when you hear from him,'' he
said. ``He's a bad man.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown quickly made a name for himself. At a July 1967 rally in
Cambridge, Md., he exhorted a crowd of 400 to get some guns and
meet fire with fire. ``Black folks built America, and if America
don't come around, we're going to burn America down,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, shooting broke out. Brown was wounded when a
single shotgun pellet struck his forehead. Rioting followed, and by
the next morning two blocks of the town lay in ashes _ including a
school that Brown had said ought to be burned.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnne Bayneum, chief judge of the Fulton County Magistrate's
Court, was living in Cambridge at the time. Her father's business
was burned down with many others in the black community. ``I cannot
believe that anyone who has a sense of history about what happened
during the '60s would romanticize these people, especially Rap
Brown,'' she said. ``These were dangerous people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge was just the beginning of Brown's problems with the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew said he ought to be locked up for
instigating arson _ and he was, after a fashion. Brown was indicted
for inciting a riot, and with the charge pending, was arrested
while attempting to board a plane in Washington with an M1 carbine
rifle. A federal judge gave him the maximum sentence of five years
in 1968, the same year he was named a minister of justice for the
Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   While the sentence for the arms conviction was on appeal, and as
Maryland was preparing to try him for the Cambridge riot, Brown
went into hiding in 1970. The FBI added him to its ``Most Wanted''
list. He reappeared 17 months later in a blaze of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Police in New York City spotted him near the scene of a saloon
hold-up and shoot-out. Officers shot Brown and arrested him,
charging him with armed robbery and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   While he was jailed and awaiting trial, Brown converted to
Islam. His new name came from a fellow inmate; Al-Amin, he
explained, means ``trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his parole from a New York prison in 1976, Al-Amin made a
pilgrimage to Mecca and then settled in West End to found the
Community Mosque of Atlanta. The 100-member congregation is part of
the National Community, a coalition of 30 mosques that traces its
roots to the Dar al-Islam Movement, an orthodox Muslim movement
founded in Brooklyn during the early '60s. Like a majority of
American Muslims, Al-Amin belongs to the mainline Sunni branch, not
the Nation of Islam with its high-profile leader Louis Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surpising that Islam would have appealed to Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslims use Islam as a way of lifting themselves out of
oppression,'' said Lawrence Mamiya, a professor of Africana studies
at Vassar College, who has interviewed Al-Amin at length. ``Islam
is seen as a religion of resistance to oppression. Islam also has
some appeal to the martial side, of men at least. It does not
emphasize turning the other cheek as Christianity does. It believes
in self-defense, an eye for an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution not long
after he arrived in Atlanta, Al-Amin made his new faith sound like
an antidote to all the things he had stood for in the popular
imagination during the '60s. ``Islam enables you, and it teaches
you not to be controlled or to do things out of anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Al-Amin seems to have followed the controlled
life he talked about. He has married and raised two children with
his wife, Karina Al-Amin, an attorney with an office in Midtown.
He's started neighborhood patrols, organized summer games for
Muslim youth, converted drug users to Islam and helped them kick
their addictions.
</P>
<P>
   People meeting him for the first time were struck with his
unexpectedly gentle manner. When political columnist George Will
visited him in 1985, he found him ``enveloped in a strange
serenity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Al-Amin was charged with aggravated assault after a man
in the neighborhood claimed he had shot him. The man later recanted
and said he was pressured by authorities to identify Al-Amin as the
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hauptman, the attorney who represented him in that case,
wonders if some version of the same story isn't unfolding again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all that has gone on in his life,'' he said, ``he would
have to be an idiot to believe that he was not targeted by the
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have studied the man in his different incarnations _
as Hubert Brown, H. Rap Brown and Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin _ had
expected not to hear much about him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sort of a person who was caught up in much larger
forces,'' said Clayborne Carson, a Stanford University historian
and author of ``In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the
1960s.'' ``He created enough of a stir to be in the news for a
while, but then he sort of fell from sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is.

<P>
   His record-shattering treasury drained by his campaign's $2
million-a-week advertising binge, George W. Bush for the first time
trails Democratic rival Al Gore in available campaign cash. Bush's
latest spending report shows he began March with just $7.5 million
_ one-tenth of the $73.9 million war chest he had amassed while
vanquishing a tougher-than-expected Arizona Sen. John McCain. In
contrast, Gore's spending slowed over the last two months along
with the waning threat from Bill Bradley. Gore, according to his
aides, had $4.1 million in the bank on March 1 and expects to
receive $7.3 million in federal matching funds in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS OPEN, BUT DO VOTERS CARE?
</P>
<P>
   Illinois voters were going to the polls Tuesday for the mostly
irrelevant Democratic presidential primary. But with the
presidential nominations largely decided and no interesting
statewide contests on the ballot, a low turnout was expected. But
both Al Gore and George W. Bush will be watching for any indication
of how the crucial battleground state will swing in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO HIS SENATE JOB
</P>
<P>
   John McCain made a low-key return to the Senate floor Tuesday,
and in his first Senate speech since suspending his presidential
bid earlier this month, thanked his supporters and promised to
press ahead on the reform issues he advocated. He chose to take on
the Clinton administration's Kosovo policy, but didn't mention his
signature issue: campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO EXPAND THE BASE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is appealing to John McCain's backers and reaching out
to Bill Bradley's top aides for support in November. ``John McCain
was right, and George W. Bush was wrong,'' Gore told a college
crowd in Springfield, Ill. After another campaign stop and
fund-raising luncheon Tuesday in New York, Gore was headed to New
Jersey, Bradley's home state. Gore planned to meet at a Bergen
County restaurant with Bradley campaign chairman Doug Berman and
other area Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   HIDE AND GO SEEK
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore criticized George W. Bush on Tuesday for not supporting
a census that would include estimates of undercounted populations.
``I want to say to Governor Bush, if you really believe that every
American counts, it's time to stand up to the operatives in your
own party and support a census that counts every American,'' Gore
said. Democrats want the U.S. Census Bureau to use sampling to
reach its final population count. The Republican Party is opposed
to sampling. Some analysts say Republicans believe undercounted
minorities would boost Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   CHARACTER ISSUE AGAINST CLINTONS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush will use the revelations of the Democrats' 1996
campaign financing strategy to raise questions about Al Gore's
character, and Rudy Giuliani will follow the same road in his New
York Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Boston Globe
reported Tuesday. The Globe quoted Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer as
saying that Bush wanted to run an issues-oriented campaign, but a
president could not achieve his goals ``if you don't first restore
honor and integrity to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVE PARTY DISTANCING
</P>
<P>
   In a move that could shake up New York's Senate race, the
powerful leader of the state Conservative Party said Tuesday he is
on the verge of backing a candidate other than Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani is a Republican, and no GOP candidate has won statewide
office in the state in more than a quarter-century without
Conservative Party backing. Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long refused to identify his possible alternative Senate candidate,
other than to say ``people will recognize the name.'' Long has
insisted that Giuliani, an abortion rights supporter, back a ban on
what critics call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Giuliani has refused
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   IF DRIVERS , WHY NOT . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani, under attack from Senate rival Hillary Rodham
Clinton for taking money from gun interests, says he favors a
sweeping licensing system for firearm owners. At a community forum
in upstate in Watertown, one resident reminded the New York City
mayor that many people in the region firmly believe in the
constitutional right to bear arms. Said Giuliani: ``I do not think
the government should cut off the right to bear arms.''
Nonetheless, he said his position for many years has been that just
as a motorist must have a license, gun owners should be required to
have one as well.
</P>
<P>
   DO AS YOGI SAID
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, said
for-profit HMOs are ``destabilizing themselves by their own greed''
and that consumers, nurses and doctors should take advantage of
looming changes in the medical system to force creation of
universal health care. ``As Yogi Berra said, `When you reach a fork
in the road, take it,' '' he told the California Nurses
Association. He said he doubts Al Gore or George W. Bush would push
for ``sound medical plans for every American.''
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING IS AMMO FOR HILLARY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton has been reluctant to criticize Rudy
Giuliani in their New York Senate race. Until recently, she rarely
even mentioned him by name. But she is now criticizing the New York
City mayor over his handling of a fatal police shooting, saying he
had ``hunkered down, taken sides and further divided this city.''
Patrick Dorismond, 26, was killed last week during an attempted
drug sting outside a midtown Manhattan bar. Dorismond, who was
black, was unarmed. Giuliani said there ``was no indication'' that
the shooting ``had anything to do with race.''
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY STIRRINGS IN MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after Gov. Jesse Ventura led the Minnesota
Reform Party out of the national organization amid growing unrest
and growing party support for Pat Buchanan, other activists want to
re-establish the party in the state. Cedric Scofield, the
Midwestern regional representative for the national Reform Party,
said that a founding convention has been scheduled for April 7 in
Minneapolis to write a party charter and elect delegates to the
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   RUSH-ING TO STAY IN CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of
Chicago last year against Richard M. Daley, now faces a strong
challenge as he tries to keep his seat in Congress. Rush, a former
Black Panther leader who left the Chicago City Council for Congress
in 1992, is facing three Democratic opponents in today's Illinois
primary, including Barack Obama, a state senator, a civil rights
lawyer and first black president of the Harvard Law Review. The
other two candidates in the race are state Sen. Donne Trotter and
George Roby, a retired police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE VOTING: GOOD OR BAD?
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times analysis concluded that ``many people
believe that online voting is inevitable and that it will increase
voter participation. But an Industry Standard article is not so
optimistic, saying online voting may just increase the ``digital
divide.'' Meanwhile, a Harvard study says that voter interest in
the presidential campaign has dropped sharply since the March 7
primaries sealed both parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   VOTERS' CHOICE FOR VP
</P>
<P>
   A new independent Zogby Poll shows that 23 percent of likely
Democratic voters think that Bill Bradley should be chosen as Al
Gore's running mate, followed by former Sen. George Mitchell of
Maine, at 13 percent. On the other side, Elizabeth Dole is the
choice of 29 percent likely Republican voters, followed by John
McCain at 27 percent.

BURN THE RUG? NO! BURN THE FLOOR! IT'S DANCE FEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The idea was born at Elton John's 50th birthday party
three years ago at Hammersmith Ballroom in London and grew into
something that, well, let's put it this way: Nobody's grandparents
danced quite this way on their wedding night.
</P>
<P>
   Take traditional ballroom dancing, add a pinch of heavy metal
and a dash of professional wrestling and you begin to have some
sense of Burn the Floor, a stage presentation of dancing
flamboyance that played to sold-out audiences in Australia and
Europe last year and is coming to the United States this week.
</P>
<P>
   The show is beginning its American tour in Denver on Wednesday
and will reach 11 cities in seven weeks, with stops including the
Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles from March 29 to 31 and Radio
City Music Hall in Manhattan on April 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   This is traditional ballroom dancing at warp speed, and audience
members of a certain age might not want to try this at home. The
show's two acts consist of 22 couples in various dress (and
undress) interpreting ballroom-style dances at a frenzied and
sultry pace to create an entirely new dance form, a little like
what might have happened had George Ballanchine ever collaborated
with Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken ballroom dancing to another level,'' said Harley
Medcalf, the show's Australian-born creator and producer, whose
inspiration came from the entertainment that John gave the 600
guests at his birthday party: a swirl of couples performing
traditional and Latin ballroom dances, slightly stylized.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were amazed, Medcalf said, adding: ``I was completely
captivated by the rawness, the sensuality of it. I had always
thought ballroom dancing was stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   And if this was exciting, he remembered thinking, what about
energizing the presentation a few degrees more?
</P>
<P>
   Through nonstop activity over the next 18 months, Medcalf
brought together many of the creative artists he had worked with in
a 20-year career of concert and touring productions that starred,
among others, John, Kenny G, Michael Crawford, Meat Loaf and Boyz
II Men.
</P>
<P>
   They included Mark Fisher, a set designer who worked with the
Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd, and Patrick Woodroffe, a lighting
director who worked with the Stones and with Medcalf when he was
promoting Michael Flatley's ``Lord of the Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   More challenging, or so Medcalf thought, was finding the
dancers. He did not realize how eager the best of them would be to
drop everything to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Ballroom dancing is wildly popular around the world, but
nonetheless a cult activity that rewards the best dancers little
more than some respect from their peers. In most Western countries,
including the United States, there are competitions every weekend,
and even national champions in a variety of categories.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of couples compete every year. But generally there are
no audiences watching, only judges and other dancers. So not many
people know who won the 1998 and 1999 United States American Style
Nine Dance Championship. (Answer: Clive Phillips and his sister,
Karen McDonald, two of the dancers in Burn the Floor.)
</P>
<P>
   For the world's best ballroom dancers, though, titles are not
enough. Sometimes they come with reasonable pay, supplementing
annual income that almost always includes teaching. Most top
ballroom dancers could not eat if they did not teach, and almost
all the dancers in Burn the Floor have been national champions and
continue to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Phillips and McDonald earned $80,000 in prize money
and from shows in addition to what they earned teaching at their
studio, Dance New York on West 54th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the best ballroom dancers have always wanted more, and until
Medcalf invited a few of them into the Burn the Floor ensemble,
there were few other outlets to accommodate the kind of artistic
expression forbidden in tightly defined competitions.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Phillips and others say they are pioneers,
presenting a show that finally gives ballroom dancing, at least
this ultra-version, the public exposure that could lead to more
shows of its kind and draw more people into dance studios for
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, we have an avenue to release our artistic
side,'' Jason Gilkison, artistic director and an ensemble member,
said, comparing the strictures of competitions with the free form
of Burn the Floor. ``It's incredibly fun, and what makes my job so
easy is that all the dancers in the show are so passionate about
what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Passion is ever present and at times borders on the steamy. Hips
get a big workout in this show. The 10 dances may not be recognized
by those who are unfamiliar with Burn the Floor: waltz, cha-cha,
samba, rumba, jitterbug, salsa, tango, lindy, jive and swing. The
sultry quality of each number is amplified by costumes, music and
lighting to fit the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Romance as unifying theme was always the idea Medcalf intended
to convey. In that sense at least, Burn the Floor clings closely to
its Ginger Rogers-Fred Astaire roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always what I come back to: ballroom dancing was always
about here, the heart and romance and beauty,'' said Medcalf, his
hand pressed to his chest. ``Now, it's just big, brassy and loud.''

U.S. TO PROPOSE INCREASE IN IRAQI EXPENDITURES ON OIL INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States will propose doubling the
sums Iraq may spend on spare parts for its decrepit oil industry,
neglected during almost 10 years of sanctions, diplomats said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S.-sponsored resolution to be circulated for
discussion among Security Council members in the next day or two,
Iraq would be permitted to raise up to $600 million every six
months _ $1.2 billion a year _ instead of the current $300 million
every six months.
</P>
<P>
   The money is raised through the oil for food program, which
allows Iraq to sell oil to meet the needs of its civilians. The
increase was recommended by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a
report to the council this month because the sanctions have left
the equipment in such poor shape.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, generally expected to be voted on by the council on
Friday unless there are unforeseen objections, is being introduced
as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
prepare to meet in Vienna next week to discuss the possibility of
increasing oil production so that record high prices will decline.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's, experts
say. Since December, the Iraqis have been permitted to sell as much
oil as they wish under the U.N.-supervised program. Some of the
proceeds pay for goods needed by civilians, who have been living
under sanctions since 1990, and for public services like water and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday an official Iraqi newspaper attacked oil-exporting
countries thought to be willing to increase production to ease
costs for the United States and other countries. ``The United
States policy of blackmail must be rejected,'' said the paper,
Al-Jumhuriya, which as with all Iraqi papers is government
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iraq has been straining its pumping and pipeline operations
to take advantage of the higher prices, although it cannot sustain
such a high level of activity for long, Annan's report said. It
described Iraqi oil installations as hazards to the safety of
workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on a technical survey of the industry
requested by the council in December and carried out in January by
an independent group of oil experts from Saybolt International BV
of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats are not concerned that allowing Iraq to double the
money spent on spare parts for oil production will cut into the
food, medicine or other purchases for the population, because with
oil prices high income is also up; if more oil is pumped, more
civilian goods can be imported. Over the last three years, Iraq has
earned $20 billion in supervised oil sales, with a third of that
going to pay compensation to victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, even with more money, Iraq says that it cannot upgrade
its oil industry effectively as long as the United States and, to a
lesser extent, Britain, block critical contracts for oil spare
parts or other related equipment in the Security Council sanctions
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials say that these contracts must be carefully
scrutinized, because Iraq appears to want to channel some new
equipment into refineries, when under the current program it is
allowed to sell only crude oil abroad. They say they fear that
refined petroleum products will earn more money for smugglers and
benefit President Saddam Hussein, his family and supporters.

 &HT;    May-December pair make comic sparks
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billie is a recently divorced, 33-year-old book editor. She
lives in a swank hotel after leaving her self-absorbed lawyer
hubby.
</P>
<P>
   Billie's (Susan Floyd) friends want to hook her up. Too late. In
walks the man, er, kid of her dreams. Aidan (Thomas Newton) is a
22-year-old room service waiter who looks like Doogie Howser's
twin. Both went to Northwestern, Billie learns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you graduate?'' she asks excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``May,'' is the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that totally freaks me out or kind of turns me
on,'' Billie wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to The Graduate _ TV style.
</P>
<P>
   Then Came You is a charming romantic comedy about the
complexities of a May-December romance. As Billie laments, Aidan is
all the right things in the wrong package. But, hey, the sex is
good. So, does it really matter that Aidan never heard of Mrs.
Robinson? Or that he pulls out a sad wad of dollar bills on a date?
Or that he doesn't remember the bicentennial? Or that he likes to
swim in Lake Michigan?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. The sex is good.
</P>
<P>
   Then Came You, based on the real life of co-creator Betsy
Thomas, was originally scheduled to air in the fall. ABC, however,
didn't think it was ready for prime time. Well, Then Came You is
certainly funnier than the bland Two Girls and A Guy. Floyd and
Newton are instantly likable as the lovestruck couple. Floyd is
bundle of perky energy (think a dark-haired Nancy Travis) and
Newton is a wonderful mixture of wide-eyed innocence and heartfelt
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   While Miriam Shor and Desmond Askew are cardboard sitcom
sidekicks as Billie's and Aidan's best buddies, at least they don't
make you gag.
</P>
<P>
   And Then Came You should only make you laugh.

<P>
   ``Hey guys, I'm going out to run some errands. Come ride with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems like a nice invitation, doesn't it? I mean if I was
just sitting around watching TV for the umpteenth hour because I
have no money and no transportation, and someone invited me to go
somewhere _ anywhere _ I'd jump at the chance. But then, I'm not a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, especially those who are barely 13, have to be
persuaded or coerced into going out into public with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a younger sibling is included in these invitations, but for
the most part, he's going to follow his anointed leader, the Grand
Poobah of Indifference.
</P>
<P>
   So, in response to my gracious invitation, the Poobah says,
``Where are you going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've just got to run by a couple of stores and take care
of a few things,'' I reply as I check my to-do list and plot the
speediest route to completing my tasks. ``Come on, we'll have fun.
I'll buy you a drink at the convenience store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine, we'll skip the drink. Just come along for the ride.
You've been cooped up in here all day watching reruns. You need
some fresh air and sunshine. I won't be gone long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But where are you going exactly?'' the Poobah asks,
emphasizing the word exactly as if he's cross-examining someone on
the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I'm going to the mall to get my watchband repaired. Then,
I've got to run by the cleaners, and I need to pick up a few things
from the grocery store. We won't be gone long. Put your shoes on
and come on. It's not like you have some pressing engagement. And
I'll make sure the answering machine is on so you won't miss any of
your urgent calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, my sons start to put their shoes on.
</P>
<P>
   The Poobah's disciple pipes in now, ``But Mom, how long will we
be gone? Dragon Ball Z comes on at four.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm so exasperated now that I'm sorry I even invited them to go
along. It wasn't always like this, you know. When they were
younger, I couldn't move without one of them trying to tag along.
They'd come running like puppies every time they heard keys jingle.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same boys that used to follow me to the bathroom
and stick their fingers under the locked door even though I begged
and pleaded with them to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have to become a travel agent and extol the virtues of
our interesting and exciting destinations before they'll agree to
get into the car with me. Or, I just put my foot down and say,
``Let's go, now!'' But then I've got to deal with their attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The performances kids give us from their ``developmental
stages'' are not always entertaining, are they? I'm told that there
is good news and bad news about our young actors. The good news is
that they eventually move on to another stage. The bad news is
that, quite often, the new drama is even more confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we get into the car. We ride into the sunset. I sing, I
tell jokes, I get them to laugh and talk and we have fun.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home, I smile. I'm pleased with myself and the fact
that we've spent quality, productive, fun time together. As we pull
into the driveway; however, I'm exhausted and looking forward to
kicking off my shoes and taking a load off.
</P>
<P>
   I'm about to turn off the ignition when the Poobah says, ``What
about my drink?''
</P>
<P>
   I think I'm ready for the final curtain on this stage.
</P>

MARTIAL-ARTS `ROMEO AND JULIET' A TRAGEDY, ALL RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best scene in ``Romeo Must Die'' doesn't have much to do
with the rest of the movie. Lead character Han (Jet Li), who
recently escaped from a Hong Kong prison to avenge the Oakland-area
death of his brother, gets talked into a pickup game of football.
Han learns the rules the hard way, falling victim to bone-crunching
tackles, before discovering that the person with the ball is the
one who gets hit. So on his next run, he tosses the ball to
opposing players, knocks the stuffing out of them, gets the ball
back and repeats the process until he gets a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The scene has a comic edge, highlighted by Li's light-speed
martial arts stunts, which comprise moves you'll never see on NFL
on Fox. Li has an even neater trick, though. Somehow, he drains all
the intelligence from his face till he looks so naive and boyish
that you don't suspect the violence within. He's always coiled and
ready to strike _ it's the movie that unravels around him.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a ``martial-arts/hip-hop Romeo and Juliet,'' ``Romeo
Must Die'' isn't a romance; it's more of a buddy movie, pairing Li
with R&AMP;B star Aaliyah, who makes her feature-film debut as Trish, a
mobster's daughter who hooks up with Han when she eludes her
bodyguard and pops into a cab that Han has just stolen. The
potential for sparks is there, but never explored; instead, the
overstuffed script by Eric Bernt and John Jarrell deals with family
honor (leading to some really hoary dialogue), mob battles for
waterfront property and a deal to find a home for Oakland's latest
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad more isn't made of Li's and Aaliyah's characters,
because both actors share a mischievous arrogance that makes
``Romeo'' fun to watch for a while. But because there are so many
characters, the movie is constantly steering away from the things
we want to see: any developing romance between Li and Aaliyah, and
Li in top tail-kicking form.
</P>
<P>
   Li does get to see some action _ according to the press notes,
it's eight fights, but who's counting? _ the best of which comes
during the aforementioned football game and other scenes in which
Li uses such unconventional weapons as a fire hose and Aaliyah
herself. But in between, there are a lot of been-there, done-that
situations, enlivened somewhat by some sharp supporting turns by
Delroy Lindo as Trish's father, Isaiah Washington as his
trigger-happy sidekick, rapper DMX as a club owner and Anthony
Anderson as Trish's ineffectual bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Romeo and Juliet connection, well, a lot of people
die, but director Andrzej Bartkowiak, a longtime cinematographer
making his directorial debut, fails to provide the movie with any
sense of encroaching doom. He's content merely to move from fight
to fight, in scenes so pedestrian it's like the action scenes were
filmed by another director. Romeo Must Die had potential; if
there's any tragedy involved, it's that Bartkowiak and the
scriptwriters didn't know how to fulfill it.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Must Die is rated R for violence, profanity and brief
nudity.
Romeo Must Die 21/2 out of 5. Director: Andrzej Bartkowiak Stars:
Jet Li, Aaliyah Length: 118 min. Rated: R

NEW TECHNOLOGY PROVES THAT LESS IS MORE  
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gasoline prices are high, and the trend may continue. At least
there's an offsetting trend that will continue, too: electronic
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic products cost less and do more,'' said Jim Barry,
spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Association. The trade group
used to have ``Manufacturing'' in its name, but dropped it within
the past year because some companies _ like DirecTV, for instance _
supply a service rather than manufacture goods.
</P>
<P>
   High-definition television costs more than a gallon of gasoline,
but the price is coming down at a faster rate than gasoline is
going up. The HDTV that cost $10,000 when it was first introduced
about two years ago has been slashed in half _ with some units
going for $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Barry said the trend has been to make
products smaller. The brick-size cellular phone from yesteryear has
been reduced to nearly the size of a matchbox _ and has far more
features than the larger model.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could make it even smaller,'' said Barry, ``but that
would just mean people would lose them. I keep this one in a belt
clip. I'm afraid that if I put it in my pocket, it would wind up at
the dry cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   CD players are smaller and lighter _ barely much larger than the
CDs themselves. Sony has just come out with one that doesn't skip,
no matter how much jarring it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions are pocketsize _ and are color, not just black and
white like they used to be. Products get longer play time from
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   What's going to be the hot new electronic product?
</P>
<P>
   Barry's answer provides some insight into why the trade
association he represents no longer is called the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturing Association. Remember at the beginning of
the column when I pointed out that CEA represents more than
manufacturers?
</P>
<P>
   The hot news in electronics in the coming year will be wireless
technology, said Barry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hooking up two computers in the home used to mean either
running cables through walls or draping them behind desks or over
chairs,'' he said. ``There's one method that uses telephone lines
in the house to connect two computers in different rooms.'' But
transfer rates using that method aren't as high as they are with
cable hookups.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless transmitters can send signals through walls and floors.
They're becoming easier to install and cheap enough so that hooking
up two computers wirelessly doesn't cost much more than doing so
with wires.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, wireless will replace wires that connect things to
computers. Printers, scanners, external disk drives and other
devices may work as well without wires as they do now with them.
And rather than wonder where to plug things in, users could justturn them on and let the computer find the new device and set it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Barry brings home the point by pulling out a Palm VII from his
coat pocket.
</P>
<P>
   It's a personal information manager (about $450) that keeps
track of addresses, phone numbers and appointments. This one costs
about $200 more than the Palm IIIx, which has many of the same
features. The extra price is for wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Barry flips up an antenna and the Palm automatically connects
with a wireless network. Within a minute, he has stock quotes,
access to e-mail, and can read news and articles from Web pages on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said it may seem like new technology is making old
technology obsolete. But what it's doing is making new technology
more desirable. The computer that's 10 years old will still do word
processing. The wired telephone can still make telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``What becomes obsolete,'' said Barry, ``is the language used
with the technology. If you say, `He sat by the telephone,' and a
teen-ager hears that, he might wonder why anyone waiting for a
telephone call would sit by the telephone. He'd think, `Why not
just take the telephone with you?' ''

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: National Organic Standards Should Become Law by 
 Summer   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Except for a few details, Bay Area organic farmers
like the federal government's newest effort to create a national
standard for organic food.
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced revised rules that define
and regulate what can and can't be labeled organic food earlier
this month. The 600 pages of regulations, written by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture after years of public wrangling, now face
another public comment period that ends in July. The rules could
become law by early fall, but it might take another 18 months
before consumers will see any effect.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the first set of USDA organic rules was hit with
heavy protest, in particular because they allowed irradiated foods
and the use of genetically modified ingredients. The new version
prohibits use of those sorts of ingredients and also bans the use
of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   States can choose to have the federal government enforce the
rules. In states like California, which has a strong organic
certification system, the federal government would need to approve
existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, it's has been extremely well received. Everyone's
relieved it's a tighter rule,'' says Michael Straus of Beyond
Organic, a Marin-based public relations consultant to the
agricultural and environmental communities. ``At this point, it
gets down to the nitty gritty of production. The rules are so tight
that there is some concern that standards might be too tough for
some farmers to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Straus says, farmers who want to use composting
manure from a dairy farm will need to figure out if the cows were
fed organic grain. But the dairy farms might not have a tracking
system in place to determine if the feed meets the new organic
standard.
</P>
<P>

on the Web site,  &LR; www.ams.usda.gov/nop &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One Banana, Two Banana &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at the University of California at Riverside are
learning that Internet-driven urban myths die hard.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, someone on campus received a mysterious e-mail
reporting that shipments of bananas from Costa Rica were infected
with necrotizing  &LR; fasciitis &LR; , a flesh-eating bacteria. Eating an
infected banana, according to the e-mail, would cause an infection
that could eat skin at a rate of two to three centimeters per hour.
Amputation was likely, death possible, the e-mail said.
</P>
<P>
   Although administrators still don't know exactly how it
happened, the e-mail was sent off campus with the name and
telephone number of the assistant to the dean of the College of
Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The e-mail was so widely
circulated that at one point last month, more than 50 inquires a
day poured into the campus, says UC Riverside spokeswoman Kathy
Barton.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad that Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta issued a press release calling it a hoax and
noting that although the disease does exist, it is not transmitted
by bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The college is still fielding inquiries. Callers to the number
on the e-mail hear a recorded message setting the record straight
and are asked to tell anyone they might have forwarded the message
to that the whole thing is a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the recording: ``Please note we do not do research on
bananas at the University of California at Riverside.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Soy What? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Students scoping out the cafeteria line will have a new choice
on April 10, when USDA rules go into effect that allow soy burgers
and other soy products to be swapped for meat.
</P>
<P>
   Under previous rules, soy could only be used as an additive. The
idea is to help limit the fat in school lunch menus, USDA officials
say. The rule applies to any school or child-care center that
offers federally subsidized meals.
</P>
<P>
   Whether students will actually choose a soy burger over a beef
burger remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be well received, though there is a question
in my mind whether it's the parents wanting it or the kids,'' says
Cindy Schneider, a child nutrition consultant for the state
Department of Education.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Sauvignon Epiphany Comes to a Wine Writer   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Anyone reading this column with any regularity
knows of my occasional ranting about the generally sad state of
California Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. More about Chardonnay
later, but now I'd like to tell you about a Sauvignon epiphany.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm a red wine drinker, but when white wine is a better choice
with my meal, then it needs to be crisp and fresh, with flavor that
echoes a grape and not a tree. Above all, the wine must go with a
wide range of dishes. To me, Sauvignon Blanc best fills that order.
I like the crisp citrusy freshness of New Zealand and South Africa
Sauvignons, and the mineral qualities of French Sauvignons from
Bordeaux and the Loire Valley.
</P>
<P>
   California Sauvignon Blanc is another matter. Sweeping
generalizations, of course, are never fair, since there usually are
exceptions to any criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I wrote a grumpy commentary on California
Sauvignon Blanc and received a nice letter from Bob Travers of
Mayacamas, along with a six-pack of Mayacamas Sauvignon Blancs.
Travers is too nice a guy to say right out, ``Get a life, Boyd!''
so he just suggested that I might enjoy the six Mayacamas
Sauvignons, from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and Mary Taylor established Mayacamas high above the Napa
Valley, on the remote slopes of Mount Veeder, in 1941. Bob and
Elinor Travers bought the property in 1968 and hired winemaker Bob
Sessions, who now is with Hanzell. Mayacamas always has been known
as a Cabernet Sauvignon house and, as Travers points out,
``although we made a little Chenin Blanc in the 1960s, Chardonnay
was our only white wine for a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayacamas produced its first Sauvignon Blanc in 1977 when the
varietal was virtually unknown in California. During the 1980s,
Travers used a little Semillon in the blend, but today the 600 to
800 cases of wine are all Sauvignon Blanc from mountain vineyards
around the winery. Mayacamas may be the only winery in the United
States to produce a mountain-grown Sauvignon Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Travers says the gravelly, rocky soils in the mountain vineyard
give the wine a ``steely character,'' a distinguishing feature of
true Sauvignon Blanc. ``I like the grassy-sage character, but when
it's just barely there,'' says Travers.
</P>
<P>
   To that I say amen, and note that the appealing mineral-steely
flavor with just a light grassy note often is missing from many
California Sauvignons that lean more to floral characteristics,
even with a little sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   I tasted the six Mayacamas Sauvignon Blancs together and found
the 1997 and 1995 especially attractive, both with juicy grapefruit
and subtle herbal flavors, great texture and crisp acidity. The
1998 (currently available at $18) is more citrus and melon but,
with another year of bottle age, has the potential to develop the
crisp slightly grassy-herbal style that is so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayacamas Sauvignon Blanc is available in limited supply in the
Bay Area, but you'll have to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Woe Is Chardonnay &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are probably more than a thousand Chardonnays produced by
the 700 bonded wineries in California, and most lack inspiration
and the appeal to encourage the drinker to have a second glass.
Although Chardonnay remains the favorite white wine of America's
wine drinkers, far too many of them are ``cookie cutter'' wines
that look, smell and taste remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Chronicle's Wine Selections recommends nine 1997 Sonoma
Chardonnays from a group of 33 wines tasted. Our five tasters,
including myself, failed to give a unanimous endorsement to any
wine, feeling they were mostly one-dimensional, too oaky and
alcoholic and too pricey for quality offered. Perhaps the general
attitude of the tasters was summed up best by one Chardonnay-loving
panelist: ``After tasting these wines, I may have to reassess my
position on Chardonnay.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Zin Fest 2000 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Zin lover, there's still time to make it over to the
Lark Creek Inn, 234 Magnolia Ave. in Larkspur, for Zin Fest 2000, a
celebration of American food with America's own red wine. Chefs
Bradley Ogden and Jeremy Sewall will be cooking up Zin-friendly
foods such as Zinfandel-braised Lamb Shank with Garlic Potato Puree
and Spring Vegetables. Ravenswood Zinfandel will be poured tonight,
Hendry Wines on March 23, Scherrer on the 24th and Biale on March
25. The tasting menu is $69 per person, with an optional wine
pairing for a $28 supplement. For reservations, call Lark Creek Inn
at (415) 924-7766.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is fast becoming one of America's most popular red wines,
but it isn't without controversy. Once a blending grape in Bordeaux
that stood in the shadow of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot is more
widely planted there now than Cabernet. The shift is mainly due to
changing worldwide tastes for softer consumer-friendly red wines.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot from the best Pomerol chateaus, such as Petrus, will age
for 30 years, producing an elegant wine with great depth. But
so-called New World Merlots, especially from California, are softer
and rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is grown in all of California's main wine regions and
does well in Eastern Washington, Southern Oregon and New York's
Long Island. Popular Merlots also are available from Chile and
Northern Italy. New Zealand Merlots and Merlot-Cabernet blends from
Hawkes Bay are the latest finds from the Southern Hemisphere.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Chef Promotes Herbs With Every Course   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If you have always thought of a tossed green salad
as something that you, well, just toss together, ``The Herbfarm
Cookbook'' might impart some shocking news. But then again, it
might also prove an epiphany.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading how chef/author Jerry Traunfeld describes the creation
of the Herbfarm Garden Salad _ from gathering the ingredients, leaf
by leaf and blossom by blossom, in the kitchen gardens surrounding
his celebrated restaurant in the Cascade foothills near Seattle, to
the individualized dressing of each and every component and the
final ritualized assembly _ you may finally fathom why your salads
seem ordinary when compared with creations of fine restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   However, while extolling the virtues of growing your own herbs,
Traunfeld doesn't dismiss the urban dweller or the cook with a
permanent brown thumb. With care, he writes, any good market today
can yield the essentials for cooking with herbs, including making
his signature salad.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that the density of the dressing must be matched to
the character of the greens _ thick, strong-tasting leaves like
radicchio or kale need a robust coating, delicate young butter
lettuce or m &LR; a &LR; che ``only the slightest whisper of vinaigrette.''
</P>
<P>
   Traunfeld, a transplanted New Yorker who got his formal training
at the California Culinary Academy, uses herbs in each of the nine
courses that make up the menu at the restaurant where he is
executive chef, and he mirrors this dedication in the book. Yet he
and his editors wisely chose not to intimidate home cooks with
forbiddingly complex restaurant preparations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the dishes in the handsomely illustrated book
have appealing simplicity and purity of flavors: Lettuce and
Tarragon Soup has only eight ingredients and can be mostly made two
days in advance. Fresh tomato and herb salad is just that _
perfectly ripe tomatoes and a handful of assorted herbs dressed
with wine and balsamic vinegars and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   His fish fillets  &LR; en papillote &LR;  detail five herb/flavor
variations and are a breeze to make. One of the easiest versions is
also one of the most intriguing: The fish packets are seasoned with
sliced shallot, fresh tarragon leaves and grapefruit sections and
zest.
</P>
<P>
   Traunfeld's lavender shortbread, made with only flour, butter,
sugar and lavender blossoms, is superb _ definitely a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Salsas, sauces and other enhancements abound in this innovative
book, and so does down-to-earth advice. Traunfeld grows herbs for
his own household in a small urban yard, so he is not addicted to
grandiose garden schemes. His advice on planning and planting an
herb garden, on the varieties to select and the pitfalls to avoid
are as solid as his detailed charts and descriptions of herbs as
common as parsley and as arcane as Good King Henry (chenopodium).

LAVENDER SHORTBREAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces unsalted butter, chilled
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons fresh lavender buds, or 2 teaspoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour (9 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes before you begin the dough, remove the butter
from the refrigerator. Place the lavender buds in a clean spice
mill with 1/4 cup of the sugar and grind until fine, or grind the
lavender with all the sugar in a blender or small food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the lavender-sugar to the bowl of a heavy-duty electric
mixer fitted with a paddle, add the remaining sugar if you used a
spice mill, and the butter. Beat on low speed until the mixture is
smooth; do not beat it until fluffy. Add all the flour at once and
continue to mix on low speed just until it forms a cohesive dough.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, press it
firmly into a smooth rectangular block with no cracks and dust it
lightly with more flour. Using a rolling pin, roll it into a 12 x
9-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, rotating the dough a quarter turn
each time you roll to make sure it is not sticking to the work
surface. You can also roll the dough out between sheets of plastic
wrap or parchment paper. Using a straight edge and a pastry wheel
or chef's knife, cut the dough into 2 x 11/2-inch bars, or cut out
other shapes with cookie cutters. Using a spatula, transfer the
cookies to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving
1/2-inch space between them. Refrigerate the cookies 30 minutes to
allow the dough to rest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Bake the cookies until they
are colored lightly like sand, not browned, 22 to 25 minutes. Lift
one with a spatula to check the color of the underside; it should
be just a shade darker than the top. Let the cookies cool
completely on the pan (they are soft while hot). Stack the cooled
cookies in an airtight container and store at room temperature for
up to 1 week.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 24 cookies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Substitutions:  &LR; In place of lavender, add 4 teaspoons finely
chopped fresh rosemary, thyme, lemon thyme, or 2 teaspoons dried
fennel or anise seeds, or 1/2 teaspoon green cardamom seeds,
grinding the seeds with the sugar as directed.
</P>
<P>

 Cooking Pasta Ahead   By Noel Advincula  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Whether you are planning your meal ahead of time
or just storing some left over pasta, how it's cooked and stored
does affect its quality.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We chose the readily available De Cecco brand of dried
spaghetti, cooked it  &LR; al dente &LR;  according to package directions,
and refrigerated it overnight. Before serving, we tossed it with a
jarred marinara sauce (1/2 cup per 1/2 pound cooked spaghetti) and
reheated it in a microwave. We did not re-store the pasta after it
had been coated with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Our first test was to determine how best to prepare pasta that
would be stored. The pasta that was cooked and drained but not
rinsed was gluey and tacky when reheated. On the other hand, the
pasta that was cooked, drained, then rinsed with cold water,
drained again and tossed with 1 teaspoon of olive oil produced a
firmer texture that met the Food department's approval.
</P>
<P>
   We also tried a batch that was stored immediately after cooking,
without sufficiently draining the excess water. The pasta looked
swollen the next day and was no longer  &LR; al dente &LR;  after being
reheated.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was determining the best storage medium for the
pasta. We found out that there was not much difference in flavor
and texture between the pasta that was stored in plastic
self-sealing bags versus being packed into small plastic containers
or spacious plastic containers.
</P>
<P>
   We also tested the storage life of the cooked pasta. We left the
pasta in plastic bags in the refrigerator for two days, three days
and six days. Most testers couldn't tell the difference between the
three. That's good news for people who like to make them in huge
batches and have it for dinner throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we compared freshly cooked pasta with pasta that had
been cooked, held overnight and reheated in the microwave the next
day with sauce. Here there was a major difference. The reheated
pasta was duller, heavier and less  &LR; al dente &LR;  than the freshly
cooked version.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even though freshly cooked pasta is best, if pasta is cooked and
stored properly it can be OK. Draining the water right away and
quickly rinsing the pasta with cold water to stop the cooking
process is an absolute must. Lightly oiling the pasta before
storing it in an airtight roomy plastic bag or container will
prevent the pasta from clumping. The pasta will keep up to six days
in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   We all think of how easy it is to cook pasta, but for the people
who want an easier way to make a quick meal, this is a very good
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to consume the pasta throughout the week,
undercook the pasta so that it is firmer than  &LR; al dente &LR; . That way
the texture should be right when it is added to the sauce.

 THE WORKING COOK: `Working Cook' Takes on a New Meaning  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Puttanesca sauce may well be the original working
cook recipe. Among the theories behind its name (which means ``of
the harlot''), is that it was a quick meal for working girls to
prepare between ``engagements.''
<P>
   Others say the name derives from the sauce's many colors _ deep
red tomatoes, purplish olives, green parsley, bright red chiles _
reminiscent of the eye-catching colors worn by ladies of the night,
according to Arthur Schwartz in ``Naples at Table'' (HarperCollins,
1998).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the etymology, the name seems appropriate for such a
spicy, zesty sauce. Served with linguine, it makes a very easy
meal, especially since the only fresh ingredient is parsley;
everything else comes straight out of the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   This week's other quick recipe, Salmon with Leeks &AMP; Bok Choy, is
a colorful display of Easter-egg colors like the pink-orange fish
and spring-green leeks. Seasoning the vegetables with rice vinegar
and lemon zest gives them a pickled flavor that suits the richness
of roasted salmon. Though the bok choy should be wilted, be careful
not to overcook it or it will lose its delicate, juicy crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend cooks should like the Now &AMP; Later recipe, Black Bean
Enchiladas with Chipotle Sauce. This vegetarian entree calls for
many steps, but the end result is a wonderful dish with a lot of
complex flavors.
</P>
<P>
   As the main filling for the enchiladas, black beans are simmered
with orange juice, which lightens up their dark, earthy taste. Sour
cream and cheese enrich the beans, and a lively sauce of
oven-roasted tomatoes and chipotle peppers tops off the dish.
</P>
<P>
   If you get tired of cooking, ask family members or dinner guests
to help you assemble the enchiladas. After all, a working cook
should work only so much.
</P>

 &UR; FAST &AMP; FRESH dinner in about 20 minutes &LR;

   SALMON WITH LEEKS &AMP; BOK CHOY

</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound baby bok choy
</P>
<P>
   4 salmon fillets, 6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon black sesame seeds (optional)

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet (one that will fit
under your broiler) with foil and grease it lightly with butter.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the stem on, slice the leek in half lengthwise and clean
thoroughly under running water. Remove stem and slice the leek
across the grain into very thin strips until you reach the dark
green part.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the red pepper flakes
and stir for a few seconds over medium-low heat. Add the leek and
saute over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until soft, 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the bok choy widthwise into 1/4-inch strips, discarding
stems. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place on the
baking sheet. Broil until golden-orange on top but still rare in
the middle, about 8 minutes (10 minutes for medium).
</P>
<P>
   After the leeks have cooked, add the bok choy, vinegar and lemon
zest. Season with salt. Cover and wilt 2 minutes, stirring once.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the vegetables and their juice in shallow soup bowls and
top with salmon. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

   BLACK BEAN ENCHILADAS WITH ROASTED TOMATO-CHIPOTLE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   This vegetarian dish freezes remarkably well. Cool completely,
then cover tightly to freeze. Defrost slowly in the refrigerator.
After reheating, add dollops of sour cream and sprinkle with
cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried black beans, soaked overnight and drained
</P>
<P>
   about 4 tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   51/2 pounds Roma tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil + 1/2 cup oil to fry tortillas
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup minced cilantro + cilantro for garnish
</P>
<P>
   2 cups low-salt vegetable stock or water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon pureed canned chipotles in adobo sauce, seeds
removed (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons adobo sauce (from the can of chipotles)
</P>
<P>
   24 super-size corn tortillas (see note)
</P>
<P>
   20 ounces dry Mexican cheese, such as queso anejo or queso seco
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place the beans in a large stockpot and cover with twice the
volume of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until
the beans are just tender, about 25 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons salt
to the water and simmer until beans are cooked through but still
firm, about 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the cooking
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes in half. Place cut-side up on a
baking sheet lined with aluminum foil; sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Place in oven and roast for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 3 tablespoons oil in another large stockpot. Add the onion
and saute for 5 minutes over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and
oregano and saute for 10 minutes. Set aside half of the mixture.
</P>
<P>
   When the beans are cooked, return to the pot with the reserved
cooking liquid, the orange juice, half of the onion mixture and 2
teaspoons salt. Simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in 2/3 cup cilantro. Remove
from heat.
</P>
<P>
   When the tomatoes are cooked, add them to the remaining onion
mixture, along with the stock, chipotle, adobo sauce and 2
teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and cover for 10
minutes to allow flavors to blend. Run through a food mill or puree
in a processor.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the 1/2 cup oil in a large skillet and place over
medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, fry the tortillas for a few
seconds on each side, until slightly crisp. Fold and drain on paper
towels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble:  &LR; Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Crumble the cheese, setting aside 1/2 cup for the top. Spread a
thick layer of chipotle sauce in 2 large casserole dishes. Dip a
tortilla in the sauce to coat. Add a few tablespoons of the black
beans, a sprinkle of cheese and a few small dollops of sour cream
down the middle of the tortilla. Roll up the tortilla and place
seam-side down in one of the casseroles. Repeat, filling each
casserole with 12 enchiladas. Spread the remaining sauce over the
enchiladas, then sprinkle with the reserved cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve garnished with cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Canned  &UR; chipotle peppers  &LR; in adobo sauce are available
in the Latino foods aisle of many supermarkets, while Mexican-style
 &UR; cheese  &LR; is also widely available, refrigerated. Most grocery stores
now carry only ``super-size'' corn  &UR; tortillas.  &LR; Use 3 or 4 extra if
using regular-size corn tortillas.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The Chronicle offers readers the recipe
for an outstanding dish at a Bay Area restaurant, plus the chef's
secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional
trim. 
 
 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: O Chame's Noodles Are O So Good   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  David Vardy has a unique personal vision of
East-West cooking at O Chame in Berkeley. While he wouldn't claim
to be a Japanese chef, his sensibilities are as traditional as his
top-level Tokyo counterparts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At his restaurant, he has become known for his noodle dishes,
and what he creates is superior to any of the noodle houses in San
Francisco's Japantown. The broth, made with dried bonito tuna
flakes and seaweed, has a subtle smokiness that pairs well with
myriad toppings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular combinations is the fleshy udon noodles
with smoked trout. The bland noodles, the peppery daikon sprouts,
and the flaky smoked fish combine for a bracing and restorative
combination.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, the large udon (wheat) and the more delicate
soba (buckwheat) noodles are served in large potter bowls,
shimmering in the bonito-based broth. Combinations include shrimp
with wakame seaweed; grilled chicken breast with spinach; and beef
with burdock root and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   The room has a similar cross-cultural orientation, and it
translates into a peaceful setting that is soothing after a long
day. The focal point of the room is an Oriental carpet at the
entrance, centered under a long table that holds a vase with an
arrangement of grasses and blooms, platters of wonderful cookies,
and a few baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   The terra-cotta-colored stucco walls are subtly etched with a
dragon and other Asian scenes. The Japanese country feel is further
enhanced with the straight-back rough wood chairs and a round
window inset with bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; O Chame, 1830 Fourth St. (near Hearst), Berkeley; (510) &LR; 
 &LR; 841-8783. Lunch, dinner Monday-Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Simmering the seaweed. &LR;  Kombu, or kelp seaweed, gives the
water a silken texture by releasing a sticky substance with the
consistency of aloe. If boiled, this texture will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Simmering the bonito. &LR;  Much like a French fumet, the fish
flakes should not be boiled. The water needs to be brought to a
simmer and immediately removed from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Cooking the noodles. &LR;  The noodles are cooked like pasta, but
you don't want them to be al dente. They should be cooked through
and tender. Do not put any salt or oil in the water during cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UDON NOODLE SOUP WITH SMOKED TROUT
</P>
<P>
   This traditional Japanese noodle dish is versatile. A number of
toppings, including grilled chicken, shrimp or thinly sliced beef,
may be substituted for the trout. Other julienned vegetables such
as daikon, carrots or cabbage also may be added. All the
ingredients, except the smoked trout, are readily available at
Japanese grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 piece (about 3 x 4 inches) dried dashi kombu (kelp)
</P>
<P>
   3.5 ounces shaved dried bonito flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup mirin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Japanese soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3/4 tablespoon sea salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried udon noodles
</P>
<P>
   4 smoked trout fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch daikon radish sprouts (about 4 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   2 scallions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the water and dashi kombu in a 8- to 10-quart pot. Set
over medium-low heat and slowly heat the water until almost ready
to boil, about 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using tongs, remove the dashi kombu and discard. Add the bonito
flakes and bring to a simmer over medium heat, skimming any scum
that forms on the surface. Do not boil. Immediately remove from
heat and let stand for 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the broth through a cheesecloth-lined sieve or a
fine-mesh sieve, pushing hard on the bonito to release all the
liquid. Discard the bonito.
</P>
<P>
   Return the strained liquid to the pot and add the mirin, soy
sauce and salt. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes to blend
the flavors. Add more salt, if needed. The stock may be used
immediately or refrigerated and reheated when needed.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, cook the udon in a large pot of boiling
unsalted water until tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Drain. Rinse
with cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the noodles among serving bowls. Top with the trout
fillets (either whole or cut into bite-size pieces), daikon sprouts
and scallions. Gently pour 11/2 to 2 cups hot broth over each bowl
of noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 CHRON  
 And the Best Supporting Flavors Are . . . Spices herbs, coffee  and
citrus boost the star power of the whole production   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If the food world awarded Oscars to ingredients,
Best Supporting Flavor would be a critical category.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a good movie, a good dish depends just as much on its
supporting cast as it does on its star. Supporting flavors make
food interesting, bite after bite, giving a dish fullness and extra
verve. A whisper of vanilla boosts the flavor of chocolate; a
grating of nutmeg adds nuance to a cream sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Just like actors, supporting flavors can be leads as well.
Vanilla, for example, is as versatile as Kevin Spacey. He's
nominated this year for Best Actor in ``American Beauty'' but he's
tops at smaller roles, too, like his Oscar-winning Best Supporting
role in ``The Usual Suspects'' in 1995. Just like Spacey, vanilla
enhances the whole, no matter the size of the particular part.
</P>
<P>
   More exotic ingredients, like star anise and lavender, are
reminiscent of Angelina Jolie, nominated for Best Supporting
Actress in ``Girl, Interrupted'' _ an intense, mysterious
undercurrent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are flavors that fit into the ``Jim Carrey
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey has been overlooked for his work in films like ``The
Truman Show'' and was left out again this year for ``Man on the
Moon.'' Chile peppers and cloves are the food world equivalent _
because they can take a dish over the top unless they are used
judiciously, they may not be considered a best supporting
ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting the most out of these ingredients is knowing
how they work in supporting roles. Cooks assume the roles of
directors, learning where and when to coax and combine
performances.
</P>
<P>
   So, with Oscars taking center stage on Sunday, here our our
nominees for Best Supporting Flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VANILLA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No ingredient has as wide a range as vanilla. Vanilla brings out
the best in a chocolate chip cookie, but it also has a magical
effect on lobster bisque, where it intensifies the sweetness of the
shellfish. It also brings out shrimp's sweet flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FENNEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The licorice notes of fennel do the same thing for seafood
dishes, which is what makes it so important for bouillabaisse.
Whether you use fresh fennel or fennel seeds, the effect is similar
_ the fish will taste sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MINT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mint is also a candidate. It's no secret why so many cuisines
pair lamb and mint. The herb cuts through the rich flavors and
fattiness of the meat plus it adds a refreshing herbal note to the
entire dish.
</P>
<P>
   Mint can also work in salad. Throw whole leaves in with baby
greens dressed with a tart lemon vinaigrette and it adds a yet
another layer of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITRUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Citrus fruits garner an out-of-left field nomination because
they're more often used as the star. But they're the kamikaze of
supporting ingredients _ when used in the right amount, they
sacrifice their own flavor for the benefit of the overall dish.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze a lemon on a piece of fish and it's not the lemon you
taste but rather a tingling tartness that aligns with the fish's
inherent flavor, cutting its natural oils.
</P>
<P>
   And citrus isn't just for fish. Chef Paul Bertolli of Oliveto in
Oakland serves his breaded lamb chops with lemon wedges, but not
just as a garnish. A few drops of the juice permeates the oil
flavors and crispiness of the crust, lending the dish a fresher
flavor. It does the same for  &LR; Wiener &LR;   &LR; schnitzel &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COFFEE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Coffee seems an unlikely supporting ingredient nominee, but when
used correctly it can embolden the flavor of beef stew or braised
lamb shanks. It also makes chocolate taste more chocolate-y.
Recipes for chocolate desserts often call for a bit of espresso
powder to push the flavor up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STAR ANISE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Star anise has been playing in the Asian cooking arena for
hundreds of years, but can add an intriguing supporting note to a
wide variety of dishes. Throw a couple pieces in a pot of white
beans and watch diners try to figure out what accounts for the
elusive flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Star anise also adds an intriguing fragrance to soups and
desserts, particularly those made with fruit. Pastry chef and
cookbook author David Lebovitz uses it in poached pears along with
cinnamon sticks and black pepper. It's a marvelous combination.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAVENDER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then there's lavender, the floral back note to herbes de
Provence. Combined in small quantities with lemon, garlic and other
herbs, the dried buds offer an almost indescribable flavor. Chefs
at Cafe La Haye in Sonoma use lavender with black pepper on a filet
mignon, and the meat is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHILES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chile peppers are one of those ingredients thought to be fit
only for starring performances. They're so powerful they tend to
obliterate everything else. But, just like a good director, a
knowledgeable cook can use the tiniest amount to add unexpected
heat to dishes like chocolate ice cream. It's a surprising
combination, but it can work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLACK PEPPER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, a few grinds of black pepper over apple
pie filling before the pie is baked adds a tingling sensation to
each bite. The pepper makes the apples taste more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLOVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cloves, too, can overshadow all else. Use too much and short
ribs braised in wine and tomato sauce taste like they should be
served for Christmas breakfast, but in small quantities _ 1/2
teaspoon in a humongous pot _ the sauce gets a sweet, fragrant and
mysterious quality.
</P>
<P>
   So while Hollywood turns the spotlight on its stars on Sunday,
let's give a round of applause today to supporting ingredients.
They're showcased in the accompanying recipes that will also let
you polish your ``director's'' skills so you can get the most out
of ingredients that may not be at the top of the casting call.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; MUSSELS IN COCONUT BROTH &LR;

 &UR; ROAST LAMB WITH MINT PESTO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fresh mint cuts the richness of the lamb and pairs well with the
garlic. Try this as a sandwich on a split baguette with crumbled
feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   31/2- to 4-pound boneless leg of lamb, rolled and tied
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon + 1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried marjoram
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (packed) fresh mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup toasted pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Make small slits all over the lamb. Insert garlic into each
slit. Rub the lamb with 1 tablespoon olive oil and the marjoram.
Season generously with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place the lamb in a roasting pan. Roast 20 minutes. Reduce oven
temperature to 375 degrees. Continue roasting until the lamb
registers 130 on a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of
the meat, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the lamb to a cutting board. Tent with foil and let
stand 15 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Process the mint leaves and sugar in a processor until the mint
is finely chopped. Add the lemon juice and pine nuts and process
until the nuts are chopped. With the processor running, gradually
add the remaining 1/4 cup oil and process until the mixture is
completely emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the lamb. Arrange on a platter. Drizzle with the mint
pesto.

 &UR; GRILLED LAVENDER CHICKEN ON ARUGULA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lavender adds an unusual floral flavor to the chicken and lemon.
Arugula works as a bitter counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried lavender blossoms
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarse salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper + pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon + 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless chicken half-breasts, with skin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey (preferably lavender honey)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   4 cups arugula
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the lavender, lemon zest, salt and pepper in a mortar
and pestle and grind to a fine powder. Stir in the 1 tablespoon oil
to form a paste. Smear the paste on both sides of the chicken,
smearing some under the skin. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour
and up to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a barbecue (medium-high heat; alternately you may cook
the chicken on a grill pan on top of the stove).
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together the lemon juice, honey, tarragon and mustard in a
small bowl. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil. Season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Grill the chicken until cooked through, about 4 minutes per
side. Transfer to a cutting board.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the arugula with the dressing. Divide among serving plates.
Cut the chicken crosswise into 1-inch strips. Arrange on the
arugula. Drizzle with any remaining dressing.

 &UR; WINE-BRAISED SHORT RIBS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Just a tiny amount of ground cloves adds a tingly sensation to
this dish. Resist the temptation to use more, which quickly takes
the cloves from a supporting role to an overacting position.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds beef short ribs
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   All-purpose flour for coating
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 (141/2-ounce) can tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   1 (141/2-ounce) can beef broth
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Hot buttered noodles
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven over
medium-high heat. Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Coat with
flour, shaking off the excess. Working in batches, add the ribs to
the Dutch oven and cook until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes
per batch. Using tongs, transfer the ribs to a platter. Pour off
any fat in the Dutch oven.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same Dutch oven over
medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until beginning to brown,
about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and stir 2 minutes. Add the tomato
paste and cloves and stir 2 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a
boil, scraping up any browned bits. Boil until the liquid is
reduced by half, about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomato puree, broth and bay leaves. Return the ribs to
the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer
until the ribs are very tender, about 2 hours. Adjust the seasoning
with salt and pepper if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Place the noodles on a platter. Top with the short ribs. Pour
the sauce over and serve.

CHOCOLATE ESPRESSO COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Espresso powder kicks up the chocolate flavor to an intense
level. The batter on these is a bit thin, but the cookies don't
spread out too much. The recipe works just as well as brownies,
baked in a 9-inch square glass baking dish for about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup golden brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or toasted walnuts
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with
parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the flour, salt and baking powder in a small bowl. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the chocolate and butter in a heavy small saucepan over
low heat. Stir until melted and smooth. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the eggs, sugar, brown sugar, vanilla and espresso powder
in a large bowl until well blended. Stir in the warm chocolate
mixture until combined. Stir in the dry ingredients, then the
chocolate chips or nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the batter by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the prepared
baking sheets. Bake until the tops of the cookies crack and cookies
are softly set, about 12 minutes. Transfer the baking sheets to
racks. Cool 5 minutes. Transfer the cookies to racks and cool
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 30 cookies.

 &HT;    POPE MAKES HISTORIC ARRIVAL IN ISRAEL
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With POPE-HOLOCAUST-0322.
 &HT;    EDs: John Paul II became pope in October 1978.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ On a pilgrimage aimed at sweeping aside
ancient animosities, Pope John Paul II Tuesday became the first
pontiff to make an official visit to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope arrived at Ben Gurion International Airport in a Royal
Jordanian airliner, which had carried him from Amman, Jordan across
the desert and the Jordan River. Upon landing, Israeli and Vatican
flags were mounted in the cockpit windows of the Arab airliner.
</P>
<P>
   He kissed a golden bowl of earth held before him by three
children: one Muslim; one Jewish; and one Christian. They were from
the area of Nazareth, an Israeli city and the land of Christ's
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Holy Land,'' Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
told the Pope while shaking his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Israel's top officials were lined on the red
carpet to greet the leader of the world's one billion Catholics.
Some were quick to use the event to stress Israel's control over
this disputed city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The frail-looking 79-year-old pontiff moved slowly, but steadily
as he exited his airplane and stood for a 30-minute welcoming
ceremony under gray skies and a drizzle in mid-50s temperatures.
His arrival was met with the fanfare of the Israeli army's
orchestra and color guard.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pope, the trip is a deeply spiritual visit to the land
of Jesus Christ. He has declared 2000 a ``Holy Year.'' This trip is
the highlight of the church's ``purification of memory'' as it
starts the third millennium since Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   The trip may also be the most celebrated moment of his 22-year
papacy. This millennial push for reconciliation could determine his
historical legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is scheduled to spend five nights and six days in
Israel and the West Bank lands controlled by the Palestinian
Authority. On Wednesday, he goes to Palestinian-controlled
Bethlehem to hold a Mass near the birthplace of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope said he arrived with ``profound emotion'' and noted
that ``many things have changed'' in relations between Catholics
and the Jews. It is a history scarred by the violence of the
Medieval crusades, the oppression of the Inquisition and the
silence of many Catholics during the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   He is only the second Roman Catholic pope to come here. The
Vatican did not establish diplomatic relations with Israel until
1994, in part out of concern for Christians living in Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The previous papal visitor, Pope Paul VI in 1964, only spent 11
hours in the country and refused to publicly say the word
``Israel'' or recognize the country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, John Paul II mentioned Israel four times in his
short airport remarks. He asked for better relations between
Muslims, Jews and Christians and between the competing _ sometimes
fighting _ Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``World opinion follows with close attention the peace process,
which finds all the peoples of the region involved in the difficult
search for a lasting peace with justice for all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My journey therefore is a pilgrimage in a spirit of humble
gratitude and hope, to the origins of our religious history. It is
a tribute to the three religious traditions which co-exist in this
land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his comments with, ``Shalom,'' the Hebrew word for
greetings and peace. The Pope was then driven to an awaiting
helicopter that took him to Jerusalem, where he will spend his
nights in the Vatican's delegation building.
</P>
<P>
   His last trip here was in 1963, as the Bishop of Krakow. He
would later write about it as an ``unforgettable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   This trip will take him to the most sacred places in
Christianity. In addition to the site of Christ's birth, his
schedule will take him later in the week to the traditional
locations of Christ's crucifixion and his Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   He will deliver a Mass for an expected 100,000 people
overlooking the Sea of Galilee and visit the Western Wall, sacred
to Jews, and the Dome of the Rock, sacred to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 Catholics from around the world are arriving on
their own simultaneous pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, the Pope will be enclosed in heavy security.
About 22,000 Israeli police and soldiers will be on duty during
``Operation Old Friend,'' in the Israeli portions of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is fraught with the potential for political
controversy. Both Israelis and Palestinians seek symbolic
vindication in the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders this week asked the Pope to advocate that
Israel share control over Jerusalem. Israel captured the eastern
portion of the city in 1967, and claims sole control. Most other
governments say its status is up for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials Monday ordered the Palestinians to lower a
balloon flown in Jerusalem that dangled the Palestinian and Vatican
flags. Other squabbles have developed over everything from whether
Palestinian officials will be allowed to accompany the Pope to
certain sites, whether Israel should handle security in eastern
Jerusalem and even whether the Pope's stand-by ambulance should
carry the Star of David.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremist Jews have called the Pope and anti-Semitic
``pagan.'' Some Muslims have said they seek apologies from the Pope
for the Crusades, which past popes ordered in an attempt to conquer
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Local Christians, about 180,000 Arabs in Israel and the
Palestinian areas, hope the Pope's visit will bolster their
minority status here. But, many of them also hope he will speak out
for Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The pope will make two high-profile, non-religious stops during
his trip. Wednesday, he will visit the Dheisheh Refugee Camp in
Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem. The 52-year-old camp is home to
about 10,000 Muslims with origins mostly in towns now controlled by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he will visit Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial museum, where he will meet Jewish survivors from his own
hometown in Poland. Though the Pope has expressed regret for the
inaction of some Catholics in the face of the Holocaust, some Jews
feel he has not gone far enough in his apologies.
</P>
<P>
   In his welcoming remarks, Israeli President Ezer Weizman
credited the Pope for his efforts to reconcile relations with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate your Holiness' contribution to condemning
anti-Semitism by labeling it as a sin against God and humanity and
by the request for forgiveness for deeds carried out in the past by
representatives of the Church against the Jewish people,'' Weizman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman also took the opportunity to remind the pope of Israel's
positions on key issues, calling Jerusalem the ``capital and source
of pride of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert met the Pope's helicopter in
Jerusalem and said the symbolism of the pontiff's landing was
important. ``In my opinion we emphasized what we wanted to
emphasize and he let us do this,'' Olmert said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem arrival culminated a long day for the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Pope led a Mass before tens of thousands of
worshippers in an Amman sports stadium. He also visited a site in
Jordan that some archeologists say could be where John the Baptist
baptized Christ. That site presents competition to an Israeli site
long seen as the place of Christ's baptism.

   The busy day may have proved tiring for the Pope, who trembles
with the symptoms typical of Parkinson's disease. On his early
evening arrival in Israel, he gave a half wave upon exiting the
airplane and braved the breezes that almost blew off his white
skullcap.
</P>
<P>
   But, the site of the white-robed elder clearly energized those
who greeted him, shook his hand and smiled excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an historic moment and will be remembered in the
future,'' said Daphna Bar-Sade, the 11-year-old Jewish girl who
helped carry the bowl of soil the pope kissed. ``He looked fine for
his age.''

 &HT;    HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEIR CHILDHOOD
FRIEND: THE POPE

   JERUSALEM _ In this land of distorted perceptions, it's not
surprising that a small group of people believe they are at least
partially responsible for the pilgrimage Pope John Paul II is
making this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the two dozen Holocaust survivors and their relatives _ who
will meet the pontiff at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial in
Israel, on Thursday _ may actually have a point.
</P>
<P>
   They knew the Pope as a boy, they say, when his impressions of
Jews were formed. And they contend that the relationships the young
Karol Wojtyla built with them and their families prepared the
foundation for the attitudes that have propelled John Paul II to
try and close the gap between Jews and gentiles throughout his
papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has made some enormous steps toward the Jewish
people,'' said Meir Gorsky, an oral surgeon whose father grew up
with the future pope. ``And I think a lot of that comes from the
fact that he has a lot of Jewish friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Wadowice, Poland, the small town located in the
Carpathian foothills 30 miles southwest of Krakow where Wojtyla
spent the first 18 years of his life, Jews and gentiles lived in
the same buildings, attended the same schools and played on the
same athletic fields. As a young man, Wojtyla even attended
synagogue to hear a famous cantor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply loved Jews and loved listening to Jewish chanting,''
said Joseph Bienenstock, an 80-year-old retired watchmaker who grew
up next door to the pope. ``There are no people like him. Not just
his position, I mean as a human being. He has been able to address
all of the
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in the world to stop anti-Semitism and remove the
notion that we are responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus. No
Pope has declared this in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Wojtyla was 19 when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, and not
long after virtually every Jew in the small town disappeared. Some
fled; others were deported to death camps. More than 3 million
Polish Jews were murdered by the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were 42 of the 47 members of the family of Meir Lau,
the chief Ashkenazi rabbi of Israel. As a boy, Wojtyla often saw
Lau's grandfather walking to synagogue surrounded by his children
and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's friendships with Jews are important, Lau said, but
the empathy he has demonstrated as a result of those friendships
toward Jews is even more so.
</P>
<P>
   What has most impressed Lau about John Paul was a decision the
pontiff made 44 years ago when he was still a young priest.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, a Jewish couple gave their 2-year-old boy
to Catholic neighbors for safe-keeping immediately before the Nazis
deported them, Lau said. The parents asked their neighbors to send
the boy to relatives in America if they did not return.
</P>
<P>
   But four years later, after it became clear that the parents
were dead, the neighbors decided to adopt the child. They brought
him to the local parish to have him baptized, but their priest,
after learning of the circumstances surrounding the adoption,
refused their request. Instead he urged the couple to send the boy
to his relatives in America.
</P>
<P>
   That priest, Lau said, was Father Karol Wojtyla.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, John Paul's visit to Israel is not without
controversy. Some in the Jewish community have criticized the
pontiff for not mentioning the Holocaust specifically during his
apology a week ago Sunday. Others have complained he has not
demanded the removal of several crosses at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most divisive is the Vatican's move to consider Pope
Pius XII for beatification. Many believe anti-Semitism motivated
Pius_relative reticence during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can and here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But supporters point to the things John Paul II has done, often
away from the public eye, to take the measure of the man. For
instance, years after the war, when he was a young bishop, Wojtyla
was visiting Wadowice when he came across the grave of
Bienenstock's younger brother in the Jewish cemetery. The cemetery
caretaker told the bishop Nazis had beaten Bienenstock to death.
His grave marker was a simple inscription on a piece of tin. The
bishop, who knew the Bienenstock family well, paid to have it
replaced with a marble tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   Jews who know the pope say these experiences have shaped him,
and by extension, his papacy and the contemporary Catholic church.
He has reached out to Jews at hundreds of occasions throughout his
career, said Rabbi David Rosen, the Jerusalem director of the
Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   When he remembers those who died in the Holocaust, he does not
remember faceless victims, but friends and classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they lived in Wadowice, my father used to play the piano
and the pope used to sing,'' said Meir Gorsky. ``I don't think you
just forget things like that. They shape you, they are a part of
who you are.''

 &HT;    FOR NRA, ENFORCEMENT OF GUN LAWS IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE
 &HT;    640&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Rifle Association, criticized for its
harsh rhetoric and hard-line opposition to gun-control, is fighting
back by focusing on a popular message _ enforcing gun laws already
on the books.
</P>
<P>
   The theme resonates in NRA President Charlton Heston's defiant
ads on television, in public remarks by other officials and
supporters, and in multiple essays and press releases on the
group's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the polls I've seen, going back years and years, indicate
that Americans expect and want enforcement of laws that prohibit
felons from carrying guns, prohibit drug dealers from carrying
guns, prohibit violent felons from even trying to get them,'' said
NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ``And yet those laws are never enforced
or hardly ever enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers said that the NRA has pushed the issue for several years.
Now, he said, it ``has reached a broader spotlight and is being
discussed at the national level,'' and that is a ``positive thing
for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and gun-control advocates have pounded the NRA
for opposing gun-show restrictions and other bills in Congress, and
for criticizing last week's agreement by gun maker Smith and Wesson
to provide trigger locks with every gun it ships.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some moderate Republicans such as Gov. George
Pataki of New York and former President Gerald Ford have said the
GOP should accept some gun restrictions that the NRA has
steadfastly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The group's response has been to emphasize its enforcement
message, which enjoys broad public support, according to polls by
conservative groups and the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the message hit a sour note recently when NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierre said on a television talk show that
Clinton is ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to
further his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Even leading Republicans criticized that comment.
</P>
<P>
   The party's expected presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, said LaPierre went too far. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said ``it's an extreme
statement'' and not ``terribly helpful to trying to reach a
consensus on a very difficult issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But LaPierre has not backed down from his stance, and Heston
also defended it, telling NBC's Maria Shriver on Monday: ``You guys
owe Wayne an apology. He was right and you guys were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston refused to discuss the comment further, focusing instead
on the case of Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, previously known as H. Rap
Brown, who was captured Monday as a suspect in the shooting death
of Fulton County, Ga., Sheriff's Deputy Ricky Kinchen.
</P>
<P>
   Other NRA officials have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deputy sheriff in Atlanta dead today because the
charges against H. Rap Brown with respect to felony possession
charges were dropped,'' Powers said. ``He should be in the middle
of a 10-year sentence in a federal prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in Al-Amin's 1995 gun case said Monday that
it disintegrated because a key witness in a related charge recanted
his story.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates say the NRA's stress on the enforcement
issue is hypocritical because the group has opposed bills in
Congress that would strengthen enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Democratic lawmakers Tuesday introduced a measure
that would pay for 1,000 new local, state and federal prosecutors,
500 ATF agents and inspectors, local anti-gun media campaigns and
other programs. It would also increase ATF inspections of firearms
dealers and improve record-keeping of domestic violence offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that the NRA should support
the bill if they are serious about enforcement. But he added: ``I
wouldn't hold my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pushing for laws to require safety locks on all
handguns, ban imports of large-capacity ammunition clips, and
require 72-hour background checks for buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed separate versions of a bill
that includes gun control measures but have not found a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who is a leading gun control advocate in the Senate,
said that he wouldn't be surprised if Bush ``calls up (Senate
Majority Leader) Trent Lott and calls up (House Speaker) Dennis
Hastert and says: 'Hey, get me off the hook. Let this bill pass.'
``
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be faced with an important decision sometime this
year, Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can either break free of the NRA and help his party break
free of the NRA or he will lose a good percentage of swing voters,
many of whom ... tend to be suburban women.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has challenged Congress to pass some gun control
measures before April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine High
School massacre in Littleton, Colo. Two Columbine students used
high-powered guns to murder 12 students and a teacher before
killing themselves.

   Police clash with Clinton protesters in India
</P>
<P>
   By Moni Basu
</P>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, INDIA _ Police fired water canons Tuesday afternoon
to subdue angry crowds protesting President Clinton's visit in the
heart of the Indian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tight security throughout the city, the protesters,
carrying anti-U.S. signs and chanting ``Bill Clinton, go home,''
marched about a mile to the American Center, where they tried to
break through police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want Clinton to interfere in India's matters,'' said
Chandrani Chatterji, a graduate student at Jawaharlal Nehru
University. ``Every time the Americans go somewhere to talk, they
end up getting involved. We don't need America to solve our
problems for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 350 protesters were affiliated with the Communist
Party India (Marxist), which opposes the growth of foreign
investments in India. It is generally believed that if Clinton's
visit achieves nothing else, it will at least succeed in forging
new trade links between the world's two largest democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that the result of the Clinton trip will
mean more unemployment and hard times for Indians,'' said Suraj Dev
Singh, another graduate student at JNU. ``More privatization will
mean more foreign multinationals, which are basically interested
only in their own pound of flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's protest was one of several that have been held in New
Delhi over the last few days. On Sunday, the day the president
arrived in the subcontinent, anti-U.S. demonstrators burned him in
effigy. Singh said the protests are designed to let the world know
that not all Indians support the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's
friendly overtures toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's trip reflects the spineless attitude of the BJP
government when it comes to the United States,'' said protester
T.K. Rajlakshmi, a journalist with a leading English-language
weekly magazine called ``Frontline.'' ``One one hand, they shout
nationalist slogans. On the other hand, they don't hesitate to
sponsor a complete sellout of the country,'' she said brushing back
hair soaking wet from the water canons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demonstration threatened to turn violent with
protesters hurling stones, riot police were unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing what they are expected to do,'' said Ramesh
Rana, a senior police officer. ``It is nothing but meaningless
party politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's demonstration did not cut much ice with U.S.
officials, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demonstrations are a fact of life here. They aren't unusual at
all,'' said embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Corwin.
</P>
<P>
   Also undeterred were a group of Indian community leaders from
across the United States, who traveled back to their homeland to
promote Indo-U.S. ties during Clinton's South Asia sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protesters have a lack of understanding of the modern
world and the free enterprise system,'' said Atlantan Antony
Thaliath, vice president of the National Federation of
Indian-American Associations. ``It's an old-fashioned way of
blindly protesting. They don't know what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFIA's Subash Razdan, also from Atlanta, said 14 members of
his organization met with Clinton in New Delhi on Sunday night.
Razdan, a native of the war-torn Kashmir region, said he is banking
on the president to help ease tensions between nuclear powers India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we have enough confidence and faith in him that he
will go back with a (peace) treaty in his hands,'' Razdan said. ``I
am very hopeful that he will help bring permanent peace in Kashmir.
We are waiting for him to get the Nobel Peace Prize.''

 &HT;    COMMISSION FAILS TO REACH COMPROMISE ON INTERNET SALES TAXES

   DALLAS _ Long hours of closed-door negotiations Tuesday failed
to produce a compromise that would allow a federal commission to
make a formal recommendation to Congress on Internet sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of the 19 members of the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce to agree on language that could win a
``supermajority'' of 13 votes means Congress will not get the clear
direction it had sought on taxing electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's two-day meeting here was its last scheduled
session. It was supposed to issue its recommendations by April 21.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the commission did vote 11-8 to urge Congress to
extend the current moratorium on new Internet sales through 2006,
ban Internet access taxes, repeal a federal 3 percent
telecommunications excise tax, and grant tax exemptions for sales
taxes on goods that can be ``digitized,'' such as records and
books. But that vote was short of the two-thirds requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners will continue to teleconference in coming
weeks to see if they can find language on which 13 of them can
agree.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's chairman, Gov. James Gilmore, R-Va., said he is
still committed to sending Congress a majority report if a 13-vote
consensus is not reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we made a great deal of progress,'' he said. ``We're
going to present a wonderful majority report to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's failure to accomplish its mission in Dallas suggests
just how difficult the sales tax issue will be for lawmakers, who
most likely will take it up next year. ``What we're reporting back
(to Congress) is, you know, this is a tough issue,'' said Stan
Sokul, a commission member and consultant to the Association of
Interactive Media.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to form a supermajority also demonstrated the
growing political clout of traditional retailers, who are angry
about the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, retailers must collect sales taxes from
customers only in states in which they have a physical presence, or
a ``nexus'' in legal terminology. That means an Internet retailer
without storefronts doesn't have to collect taxes on items shipped
out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional merchants, including powerful companies such as
Wal-Mart and Circuit City, say they want a ``level playing field''
on which all retailers share the same tax collection
responsibilities whether they are operating in a store, on line or
by phone or mail order.
</P>
<P>
   Most state and local government officials agree, saying public
coffers can't afford to lose sales tax revenues as more commerce
shifts to online companies. Sales taxes generate about a third of
all state revenues, or about $150 billion annually, and typically
are used to pay for schools, police, roads and other basic
services.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study at the University of Tennessee forecast that at
the rate electronic commerce is growing, states could be losing
$10.8 billion annually by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Americans are now aware of the rapid growth of
electronic commerce, that was not the case in 1998. When Congress
created the commission that year, it was widely expected that the
group would urge lawmakers to keep cyberspace free of the
responsibility to collect and remit out-of-state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many observers believe the Republican-led Congress
stacked the commission to make sure that would be the outcome. For
example, the six business representatives were all chosen from
companies with significant online operations: America Online, AT&AMP;T,
Gateway, MCI WorldCom, Charles Schwab and Time Warner. No
traditional retailer had a voice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gilmore, a staunch opponent of Internet taxes, was
made chair of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the ``level playing field'' argument has
been gaining adherents, even among many conservatives who fear
lawmakers might look to income and property taxes to make up for
lost sales tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the effort to put online and traditional retailers
on equal footing admit, however, that sales taxes as they are
structured today are too complicated. The nation has more than
30,000 taxing jurisdictions, imposing a bewildering array of rates
and rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael Leavitt, R-Utah, a commission member who leads the
``level playing field'' forces, said states must begin to simplify
and coordinate their tax laws to prepare for the borderless
Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the commission's failure to reach a
supermajority vote prompted Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to introduce
legislation to extend the current moratorium on new Internet taxes
through 2006. The current ban is set to expire in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That move may also suggest that Leavitt's supporters are gaining
strength. McCain earlier had introduced a bill to impose a
permanent ban on Internet sales taxes, but his new bill merely
extends the moratorium. In a statement, McCain said he has ``become
convinced that we need more time to determine how state and local
governments will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to consider ... how to ensure a level playing field
for all venues of commerce,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Tuesday it would support an extension of
the moratorium while the ``nexus'' issues get sorted out.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is not a date that comes readily to mind. But
it is as much a day of infamy as the 7th of December, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, 1933, a few miles north of Munich, the German
government opened Dachau, the first in a series of concentration
camps. It was followed immediately by Esterwegen and Oranienburg.
Before they were through, the Nazis built more than 1,000 camps
throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are well known by now: The Nazis killed 6 million
Jews, almost one-third of the world's Jewish population. They also
tried to wipe out the Sinti and Roma gypsy tribes, Soviet prisoners
of war, homosexuals, Freemasons, Jehovah's Witnesses, the
handicapped, the mentally disabled, and political and religious
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   No book yet written covers the subject as comprehensively as
``The Holocaust Chronicle,'' a not-for-profit, 765-page volume from
Publications International of Lincolnwood, Ill. The book, published
by Louis Weber with contributions from a number of professors,
describes the history of the Holocaust year by year, starting with
Germany's economic troubles after World War I and ending in 1999
with Holocaust survivors applying for their share of a $1.25
billion settlement with Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust Chronicle'' (which is being sold in lots of six
books for $100), offers an 80,000-word time line and a forward from
Dr. Michael Berenbaum, project director of the Holocaust Memorial
Museum, that says, in part, ``What does the Holocaust have to do
with our world? ... Sadly, students today do not have to ask
whether what they are studying is relevant. The images of Bosnia,
Rwanda and Kosovo are embedded in their consciousness, more deeply
engraved in their being than images of Cambodia and Biafra from two
decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust Chronicle'' traces the tragedies at the end of
World War I _ an estimated 250,000 Germans starved in 1918 _ to May
1996, when mental patients' brains, kept in formaldehyde for more
than 50 years after being experimented on by the Nazis, finally
were buried in Hamburg. It is an 80-year saga that is still
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, inflation led to an exchange rate of four billion marks
to one dollar, paving the way for such groups as the German Workers
Party (later to become Adolf Hitler's National Socialists) to gain
power by finding scapegoats in and outside Germany. Evidence of his
anti-Semitism can be found as early as a letter Hitler wrote in
1919, while he was still in the army.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he talks of Jews as ``the racial tuberculosis of the
people'' and calls for ``the removal of the Jews altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, an Austrian who didn't become a German citizen until
Feb. 25, 1932, claimed 37 percent of the vote in Germany's national
elections that year. Once he was named chancellor in January 1933,
the country's freedoms deteriorated rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   After fire gutted the Reichstag in February, all 100 communists
elected to the German parliament were linked to the crime and
arrested. Within a month Dachau opened. By the end of the year
there were 50 concentration camps in Germany, dealing with more
than 30,000 inmates: Jews, communists, socialists and
``undesirables.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, the government called for Germans to boycott the
businesses of Germany's 565,000 Jews. On April 21, the kosher
method of slaughtering meat was forbidden. On April 25, public
schools were given non-Aryan quotas, cutting the number of Jewish
students allowed to 5 percent. In 1934, the same year Hitler was
voted the title of ``Fuhrer'' by the German people, the same year
all Jewish holidays were removed from the German calendar, the
government officially accepted the argument that Christ was not a
Jew, but a Nordic warrior put to death by the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 decreed Jews were no longer citizens
but ``subjects'' of Germany. Marriage and extramarital relations
between Jews and people of ``German or related blood'' were
forbidden, Jewish civil servants were required to retire, and it
became illegal for Jews to fly the flag or display the Reich colors
of red, black and white. The definition of ``Jew'' was given as
someone with three Jewish grandparents, while those with two Jewish
grandparents, without a Jewish spouse, were labeled ``Mischlinge,''
a distinction that lost importance over time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,400 anti-Semitic laws were passed in Germany between
1933 and 1939. Few freedoms were left by the time of Kristallnacht
on Nov. 9-10, 1938, a Nazi rampage that left 267 burned synagogues,
91 Jews dead and 30,000 more sent to concentration camps. All of
this came before the opening of World War II in 1939, when attacks
on European Jewry began in earnest.

   The introduction to ``The to ``The Holocaust Chronicle''
acknowledges that the subject ``invites a certain numbness of
response. The mind wants to shut down, turn itself off. And then
you realize that millions of individuals were killed. One death at
a time _ an end to a mortal existence for a person like you ... to
express this reality in a comprehensible way has been one goal of
this book.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberation of the concentration camps began March 21, 1945,
nearly 12 years to the day from the opening of Dachau. Russian
troops found 200 women alive in the camp at Pruszez, Poland, out of
an original total of 1,100. On April 15, British troops reached
Bergen-Belsen, finding 60,000 survivors and 27,000 unburied corpses
(typhus would claim about 500 inmates a day for 10 days following
liberation). On April 29, the camp at Dachau, which started it all,
was liberated by American soldiers, who found 32,000 inmates and 50
railroad cars piled with corpses. The Americans rounded up 123 Nazi
guards and executed them.
</P>
<P>
   One day later, on April 30, Hitler and his bride, Eva Braun,
committed suicide in a Berlin bunker.

(typhus would claim about 500 inmates a day for 10 days following
liberation). On April 29, the camp at Dachau, which started it all,
was liberated by American soldiers, who found 32,000 inmates and 50
railroad cars piled with corpses. The Americans rounded up 123 Nazi
guards and executed them.

&HT;     COURT REJECTS CLINTON PLAN TO REGULATE TOBACCO AS DRUG

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the Clinton
administration's plan to regulate cigarettes as drugs, ending the
federal government's main anti-smoking initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 ruling, the court said U.S. Food and Drug
Administration officials overreached four years ago when they
claimed they had power over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Congress never intended for the FDA to
regulate the tobacco industry,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote
for the court.
</P>
<P>
   However, O'Connor stressed that the court's decision was not
meant to downplay the deadly consequences of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that
the FDA has sought to address,'' she wrote. ``The agency has amply
demonstrated that tobacco use, particularly among children and
adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to
public health in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry officials praised the decision, saying any
regulation of cigarettes should be left to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business and industry throughout the nation ought to breathe a
sigh of relief,'' said Mark Smith, spokesman for the Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. ``The highest court in the land has
confirmed that a federal agency cannot on its own go beyond its
limits of authority set by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, also agreed with the court's ruling and said
that ``decisions about tobacco regulation should be made by
Congress and state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking groups said they would now focus on legislative
remedies. ``This ruling will put tremendous pressure on Congress,
especially during an election year, to ensure that nicotine does
not remain the only totally unregulated drug,'' said John F.
Banzhaf of Action on Smoking and Health, a Washington-based
anti-smoking group.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and several Democratic lawmakers urged
passage of legislation giving the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco,
but Republican leaders quickly opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of the FDA, ``I
don't think they do a very good job with what they're doing and
don't need any more responsibilities.'' House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, added, ``I'm not anxious to extend the power and
authority to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the agency, tobacco use is the nation's leading
cause of premature death, resulting in more than 400,000 annually.
The agency also has found that people who reach age 18 without
smoking are unlikely to start.
</P>
<P>
   To help reduce the number of minor smokers, the FDA in 1996
entered the tobacco-regulation arena. Until then, the tobacco
industry was regulated primarily through congressional mandates
such as warning labels, a ban on TV ads and tobacco sales to
minors, and rules protecting nonsmokers from secondhand smoke in
confined places like airplanes and elevators.
</P>
<P>
   When the FDA wrote its rules aimed at curbing teen smoking, it
sought to keep vending machines out of places frequented by
youngsters and to ban billboard and magazine advertising aimed at
young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry, which feared that such control
eventually would result in a ban on cigarettes, challenged the
regulations. It argued that the FDA, from its establishment under
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 until the mid-1990s
had rejected jurisdiction over tobacco and that Congress had never
granted the agency the authority to impose such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., agreed
with the industry and struck down the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court affirmed that decision, saying it
did not see how cigarettes could be classified in the same category
as a drug that is sold to prevent diseases or cure illnesses, which
was what the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was designed to cover.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said the FDA has concluded that cigarettes are unsafe
and dangerous. As a result, she said, federal law ``would require
the FDA to remove them from the market entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room
for tobacco products within the (federal law's) regulatory scheme.
If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet
they cannot be banned, they simply do not fit (under the Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act).''
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, writing for the dissenters, said he did not believe the
1938 law would require a ban on cigarettes. He said the statute
allowed the FDA to seek a ``number of remedies'' other than barring
the sale of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer added that cigarettes have ``mood-stabilizing effects
through the interaction of the chemical nicotine and the cells of
the central nervous system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines a drug as a substance,
other than food, ``intended to affect the structure or any function
of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said tobacco does fall under the FDA's jurisdiction
because cigarette manufacturers were aware of the effect of
nicotine on the body and ``intended'' to exploit that effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far more than most, this particular drug and device risks the
life-threatening harms that administrative regulation seeks to
rectify,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's ruling, anti-tobacco forces have been winning
on other fronts. In several legal settlements with the states, the
major tobacco firms have agreed to pay $246 billion to cover
smoking-related health costs. The Justice Department has brought a
similar federal lawsuit against the tobacco firms, and several
class-action suits are pending in state courts. The nation's
largest cigarette-maker, Philip Morris Co., acknowledged last
October that smoking is addictive and causes cancer. The
third-biggest company, Brown &AMP; Williamson, said in April 1999 that
smokers ``are taking significant health risks.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, a Philip Morris Co. executive said the company was
willing to discuss some government regulation of the tobacco
industry, but that the firm still opposes the FDA's effort to
regulate tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had no immediate reaction to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, most tobacco stocks gained ground after the
ruling. Philip Morris was up 43 cents at $20.37 in early afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
was up 43 cents at $16.93, and Loews, which owns Lorillard, was up
$1.75 at $46.75. But the U.S. shares of British American Tobacco,
which owns Brown &AMP; Williamson, were down 62 cents at $9.62.

&HT;     FDA WIELDS A BIG STICK OVER MANY PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration does not have the
authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug, the Supreme
Court ruled Tuesday, but the agency still has sweeping power over
what is manufactured, sold and eaten in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those products include corn, Viagra, cosmetics, animal
antibiotics, pacemakers, breast implants and CD players.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, which is one of the nation's oldest consumer-protection
agencies, traces its genesis to a 1848 law requiring the inspection
of foreign-made drugs imported into the country. The agency's
authority has grown considerably since then.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is responsible for monitoring the manufacture,
import, transport, storage, and sale of $1 trillion worth of goods
annually. It has some 1,100 investigators and inspectors who police
15,000 facilities a year as part of the regulatory oversight over
95,000 U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 9,000 employees in 157 cities, the core of the
FDA is its scientific firepower: 2,100 scientists, including 900
chemists and 300 microbiologists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA, about 3,000 products a year are deemed
unfit for consumers and are withdrawn from the marketplace, either
by voluntarily or by court-ordered seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has different regulatory powers depending on the
product. For example, with drugs and medical devices, it has fairly
broad authority to assess whether a new product should be allowed
on the market. It relies on the manufacturers to provide studies
that prove the product meets the stringent threshold of being
``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the medical devices area, the FDA has different
regulation standards depending on the product's risk to the public.
For example, devices that are life-supporting, life-sustaining or
surgically put in the human body, such as pacemakers and breast
implants, must receive agency approval before they can be marketed.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has power over the food supply. Its scientists regularly
test whether pesticide residue and other harmful agents are present
in unhealthy amounts. It sets labeling standards to let consumers
assess the nutritional value of foods. And the agency ensures that
the drugs given to animals _ especially those animals that wind up
in the food supply _ are safe for humans.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is a key federal player in policing the nation's blood
supply. Investigators examine blood bank operations for
contaminants and poor record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics also come under FDA's umbrella. However, the FDA is
only able to regulate them after they go on the market. But the
agency can order unsafe cosmetics removed from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Products that emit radiation are the FDA's responsibility. These
include medical products such as X-Ray machines and consumer
products such as microwave ovens, sunlamps and CD and DVD players.
The FDA helps set federal standards for the amount of radiation
that is safe and can order unsafe products removed from the market.

 &HT;     McCAIN RETURNS TO QUIET WELCOME IN SENATE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain made his first Senate speech
Tuesday after losing his maverick bid for the Republican
presidential nomination, talking about Kosovo to a throng of
tourists and reporters and columnists but virtually no other
senators.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used his much-anticipated return to call for retaining
U.S. peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. He made only a passing
reference to campaign finance reform, the theme that had fueled his
presidential campaign when he repeatedly charged that Congress has
been corrupted by special interest money.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain wrapped up his 15-minute speech by thanking the
American people for ``their consideration of my candidacy,'' only
Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, the No. 2 Democrat, came over to chat
with him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said later he hadn't alerted his colleagues about his
plans to speak on the Senate floor because he wanted it to be ``a
normal occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, the No. 4 Republican, said he didn't
go because he had expected McCain to speak after lunch. McCain's
fellow Arizona Republican, Sen. Jon Kyl, explained that he wasn't
there because he didn't have enough notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like there was any intention to snub him,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he didn't know McCain was ready
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have come back and listened if somebody had told me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stillness on the Senate floor was in marked contrast to the
cheering mob of tourists who flocked around McCain as he walked
from his office to the Senate floor, greeting him like a rock star
and telling him that they loved him.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate press gallery was packed with reporters and
columnists in such quantities not seen since President Clinton's
impeachment trial last year.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the chamber, reporters, who asked how it felt to come
back to the Senate, swarmed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible, I hated it, depressing,'' McCain joked. ``I'd much
rather be on the `Straight Talk Express,''' the name he gave to the
bus he used during his campaign for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain marched into the regular Tuesday lunch meeting of
Republican senators flanked by his four Senate Republican
supporters _ Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska and Kyl. Later, McCain said he had received a
standing ovation after giving a short speech to say that he was
glad to be back.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters that he would continue to press for
campaign finance reform, no matter whom he offends.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he plans to campaign for candidates who are
committed to his agenda, but then softened his stance, saying he
would help those willing to negotiate on his goal of banning soft
money, the unregulated contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain threw a jab at Vice President Al Gore, saying that if the
putative Democratic presidential nominee intends to embrace
campaign finance reform as he says, he must launch a complete
investigation into alleged abuses in the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Craig described the Tuesday luncheon as ``a fairly modest
gathering, welcoming back a returning son.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig added he didn't think a lot of hoopla was appropriate.
``He won a couple of primaries,'' Craig said. ``That does not a
president make.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added sharp words for McCain: ``Anyone in this body who
runs around saying there is corruption (in the Senate) deserves
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told reporters he would have ``a
good relationship'' with McCain now that he is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``John doesn't bother me,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of sad to see him come back because I think I'm the
meanest man in town right now,'' said Stevens, well-known for his
gruff manner.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said he had welcomed McCain back
into the fold by sending him ``a nice message for him and his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Republicans
have already mended fences with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already put those planks back on the fence and we're on
about our business,'' Lott said.

   CLINTON-INDIA (New Delhi, India) _ The United States and India
agreed to open a new relationship after what President Clinton
termed more than two decades of neglect. But in a series of
encounters between the countries' leaders, the opening chapter
proved to be spiked with surprises. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TOBACCO (Washington) _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt
a sharp if not entirely unexpected blow to the Clinton
administration's effort to curb smoking, ruling 5-4 that the Food
and Drug Administration had never received authority from Congress
to regulate tobacco products. The decision, rejecting rules
proposed by the agency in 1995 to restrict the marketing of
cigarettes to children and teen-agers, hands the question of
national tobacco regulation back to Congress. By Linda Greenhouse.

<P>
   FED-RATES (Washington) _ The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit
more on the economy and the stock market on Tuesday, raising its
benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in an
attempt to prevent an outbreak of inflation. The move was no
surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints
over the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's
chairman, that he intended to continue with his policy of raising
rates in small, steady steps until he sees signs that the
supercharged economy is throttling back. Stock prices were up on
the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining about 200
points for the day. The Nasdaq index was up 90 points. By Richard
W. Stevenson.

<P>
   NY-DORISMOND-GIULIANI (New York) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Tuesday that Hillary Rodham Clinton was engaged in a psychological
process called projection when she accused him of polarizing New
York City after the fatal police shooting of another unarmed black
man. ``It means accusing someone of what you're doing. That is
precisely what Mrs. Clinton is doing,'' he said. The mayor also
aggressively stepped up his attacks on Patrick Dorismond, the man
killed by police during an altercation on Thursday night, by
suggesting that Mr. Dorismond's previous behavior _ including a
fight with his girlfriend earlier this month _ may have contributed
to his death. By Elizabeth Bumiller.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Will the real Vladimir Putin stand up,
please? With five days left before the Russian presidential
election, perhaps the most striking observation about the vote is
that virtually no one - not rival politicians, not foreign
observers, not scholars of Russian politics and government _ can
say with certainty where Putin plans to take the nation. To an
amazing degree, he remains a blank slate, a vessel in which almost
any Russian faction can pour its dreams and hopes. By Michael
Wines.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ A federal judge on Tuesday refused to block
efforts to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, saying only
the U.S. attorney general can grant political asylum to keep the
boy in the United States. U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore's
50-page ruling dismissed the lawsuit filed by Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez, who wants to keep Elian against the wishes of the
boy's father in Cuba. (Summary from wires) By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ARTIST-LAWSUIT (Undated) _ A major art gallery is accused of
looting the estate of a prominent artist. By Carol Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-HOLYLAND (Jerusalem) _ Saying he felt deep emotion setting
foot in Israel, ``the land where God chose to pitch his tent,''
Pope John Paul arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, and was instantly
given a taste of the kind of fierce political intensity that will
vein his long-awaited religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The
Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, welcomed the first pope to visit
Israel in 36 years, with a blunt, at times defensive speech that
instantly bore into some of the key issues dividing the Vatican and
the Israeli government. By Alessandra Stanley.

``He won a couple of primaries,'' Craig said. ``That does not a
president make.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added sharp words for McCain: ``Anyone in this body who
runs around saying there is corruption (in the Senate) deserves
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told reporters he would have ``a
good relationship'' with McCain now that he is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``John doesn't bother me,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of sad to see him come back because I think I'm the
meanest man in town right now,'' said Stevens, well-known for his
gruff manner.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said he had welcomed McCain back
into the fold by sending him ``a nice message for him and his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Republicans
have already mended fences with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already put those planks back on the fence and we're on
about our business,'' Lott said.

 &HT;    Delta to fly new colors, again
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time in three years, Delta Air Lines is rolling
out a new paint scheme for its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline is switching to a design featuring
swaths of red and blue draped across the tail fin, with the word
Delta removed from the tail entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes include a nearly all-white fuselage, minus the
thick stripes of past designs. The Delta logo on the side is
enlarged, and the company's triangular ``widget'' shield is
modified to give it a softer appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was a sophisticated and fluid look, with no hard
edges,'' said marketing chief Fred Reid. ``We think it's arresting
without being over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta in 1997 unveiled an updated livery that was the first
change for the carrier in three decades. But it was also one of the
last acts of the carrier's old management team, which was soon
replaced by a crop of outside executives with their own image
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Just under half the carrier's planes have been repainted in the
'97 scheme, with the rest still sporting the old '60s design.
</P>
<P>
   Now Delta will begin repainting planes in the latest livery, a
project that will take until around the end of 2003. In the
meantime Delta will have all three liveries in its fleet. Delta's
oldest jets _ whose increasingly weathered appearance has provoked
grumbling among employees _ will be retired before they are ever
repainted.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said the new scheme is part of a broader ``re-branding'' of
Delta that includes a new ad campaign, which debuted this month,
and new employee uniforms appearing early next year.
</P>
<P>
   He said executives felt the '97 livery would never be identified
with positive changes at Delta under the new management group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of continuing with something that doesn't really
reflect what Delta's become, we elected to go with something fresh,
contemporary and sophisticated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new livery was conceived for Delta by Landor Associates, a
San Francisco firm that also did the 1997 design.
</P>
<P>
   Liveries are considered important image tools, since airliners
are essentially flying billboards. Several big U.S. carriers have
adopted new liveries in recent years, although none has switched
again as quickly as Delta.

DESPITE CAMERA TRICKS, `BEAT' WORTH A LOOK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - You get the idea that there is much to admire in `The
Beat,'' UPN's new cop show, but it's hard to tell _ the one-hour
drama switches film stock and camera angles so often it makes
watching it lIKe TryINg tO rEAd ThE eNd Of tHiS sEnTeNCE.
</P>
<P>
   It's death by stylized filmmaking. One minute, we're watching
film, the format shows like `ER ''and `Judging Amy'' use. The next
thing you know, we're looking at grainy videotape, the kind of
thing employed by shows such as ``Cops.'' Show-offy camera angles
only add to the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons with sensitive stomachs are encouraged not to enjoy this
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Like UPN's recent, unfortunate ``Secret Agent Man,'' ``The
Beat'' is something of a departure for the network _ none of the
action takes place inside a wrestling ring. Instead, it takes place
on the streets of New York City, arguably a reasonable facsimile.
The show follows the lives, both personal and professional, of
young cops Zane Marinelli (Mark Ruffalo) and Mike Dorigan (Derek
Cecil).
</P>
<P>
   And it comes from a top-shelf production team: The executive
producers are Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson (who wrote and
directed, respectively, the first episode), who have teamed up on
great shows, such as ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   (One Fontana-Levinson quibble: Their presence means a cameo by
Richard Belzer as Detective Munch, who sighs, ``I'm nostalgic for a
good homicide'' at a crime scene. We get it, guys. We're sorry NBC
canceled your show, too. Now move on.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beat'' is one of those cop shows that allows itself to
become mired in the minutiae of the job. Fights over who gets stuck
with the paperwork are common; at one point, our heroes argue about
what you call the dot on an ``i.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beat's'' emphasis on the small details of its characters'
lives is a nice, if occasionally annoying, change. Dorigan has
recently gotten engaged to his med-school girlfriend and worries
about losing his youthful independence; Marinelli's romantic life
is a little more, shall we say, interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The first three episodes set an intriguing tone and do something
that seems to happen more and more rarely on series television _
make you wonder what'll happen next. Despite the heavy-handed
production techniques, ``The Beat'' is worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't forget the Dramamine. &QL;

 &HT;    POPE MAKES HISTORIC ARRIVAL IN ISRAEL
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With POPE-HOLOCAUST-0322.
 &HT;    EDs: John Paul II became pope in October 1978.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ On a pilgrimage aimed at sweeping aside
ancient animosities, Pope John Paul II Tuesday became the first
pontiff to make an official visit to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope arrived at Ben Gurion International Airport in a Royal
Jordanian airliner, which had carried him from Amman, Jordan across
the desert and the Jordan River. Upon landing, Israeli and Vatican
flags were mounted in the cockpit windows of the Arab airliner.
</P>
<P>
   He kissed a golden bowl of earth held before him by three
children: one Muslim; one Jewish; and one Christian. They were from
the area of Nazareth, an Israeli city and the land of Christ's
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Holy Land,'' Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
told the Pope while shaking his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Israel's top officials were lined on the red
carpet to greet the leader of the world's one billion Catholics.
Some were quick to use the event to stress Israel's control over
this disputed city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The frail-looking 79-year-old pontiff moved slowly, but steadily
as he exited his airplane and stood for a 30-minute welcoming
ceremony under gray skies and a drizzle in mid-50s temperatures.
His arrival was met with the fanfare of the Israeli army's
orchestra and color guard.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pope, the trip is a deeply spiritual visit to the land
of Jesus Christ. He has declared 2000 a ``Holy Year.'' This trip is
the highlight of the church's ``purification of memory'' as it
starts the third millennium since Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   The trip may also be the most celebrated moment of his 22-year
papacy. This millennial push for reconciliation could determine his
historical legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is scheduled to spend five nights and six days in
Israel and the West Bank lands controlled by the Palestinian
Authority. On Wednesday, he goes to Palestinian-controlled
Bethlehem to hold a Mass near the birthplace of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope said he arrived with ``profound emotion'' and noted
that ``many things have changed'' in relations between Catholics
and the Jews. It is a history scarred by the violence of the
Medieval crusades, the oppression of the Inquisition and the
silence of many Catholics during the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   He is only the second Roman Catholic pope to come to Israel. The
Vatican did not establish diplomatic relations with Israel until
1994, in part out of concern for Christians living in Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The previous papal visitor, Pope Paul VI in 1964, only spent 11
hours in the country and refused to publicly say the word
``Israel'' or recognize the country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, John Paul II mentioned Israel four times in his
short airport remarks. He asked for better relations between
Muslims, Jews and Christians and between the competing _ sometimes
fighting _ Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``World opinion follows with close attention the peace process,
which finds all the peoples of the region involved in the difficult
search for a lasting peace with justice for all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My journey therefore is a pilgrimage in a spirit of humble
gratitude and hope, to the origins of our religious history. It is
a tribute to the three religious traditions which co-exist in this
land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his comments with, ``Shalom,'' the Hebrew word for
greetings and peace. The Pope was then driven to an awaiting
helicopter that took him to Jerusalem, where he will spend his
nights in the Vatican's delegation building.
</P>
<P>
   His last trip here was in 1963, as the Bishop of Krakow. He
would later write about it as an ``unforgettable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   This trip will take him to the most sacred places in
Christianity. In addition to the site of Christ's birth, his
schedule will take him later in the week to the traditional
locations of Christ's crucifixion and his Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   He will deliver a Mass for an expected 100,000 people
overlooking the Sea of Galilee and visit the Western Wall, sacred
to Jews, and the Dome of the Rock, sacred to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 Catholics from around the world are arriving on
their own simultaneous pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, the Pope will be enclosed in heavy security.
About 22,000 Israeli police and soldiers will be on duty during
``Operation Old Friend,'' in the Israeli portions of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is fraught with the potential for political
controversy. Both Israelis and Palestinians seek symbolic
vindication in the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders this week asked the Pope to advocate that
Israel share control over Jerusalem. Israel captured the eastern
portion of the city in 1967, and claims sole control. Most other
governments say its status is up for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials Monday ordered the Palestinians to lower a
balloon flown in Jerusalem that dangled the Palestinian and Vatican
flags. Other squabbles have developed over everything from whether
Palestinian officials will be allowed to accompany the Pope to
certain sites, whether Israel should handle security in eastern
Jerusalem and even whether the Pope's stand-by ambulance should
carry the Star of David.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremist Jews have called the Pope and anti-Semitic
``pagan.'' Some Muslims have said they seek apologies from the Pope
for the Crusades, which past popes ordered in an attempt to conquer
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Local Christians, about 180,000 Arabs in Israel and the
Palestinian areas, hope the Pope's visit will bolster their
minority status here. But, many of them also hope he will speak out
for Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The pope will make two high-profile, non-religious stops during
his trip. Wednesday, he will visit the Dheisheh Refugee Camp in
Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem. The 52-year-old camp is home to
about 10,000 Muslims with origins mostly in towns now controlled by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he will visit Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial museum, where he will meet Jewish survivors from his own
hometown in Poland. Though the Pope has expressed regret for the
inaction of some Catholics in the face of the Holocaust, some Jews
feel he has not gone far enough in his apologies.
</P>
<P>
   In his welcoming remarks, Israeli President Ezer Weizman
credited the Pope for his efforts to reconcile relations with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate your Holiness' contribution to condemning
anti-Semitism by labeling it as a sin against God and humanity and
by the request for forgiveness for deeds carried out in the past by
representatives of the Church against the Jewish people,'' Weizman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman also took the opportunity to remind the pope of Israel's
positions on key issues, calling Jerusalem the ``capital and source
of pride of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert met the Pope's helicopter in
Jerusalem and said the symbolism of the pontiff's landing was
important. ``In my opinion we emphasized what we wanted to
emphasize and he let us do this,'' Olmert said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem arrival culminated a long day for the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Pope led a Mass before tens of thousands of
worshippers in an Amman sports stadium. He also visited a site in
Jordan that some archeologists say could be where John the Baptist
baptized Christ. That site presents competition to an Israeli site
long seen as the place of Christ's baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The busy day may have proved tiring for the Pope, who trembles
with the symptoms typical of Parkinson's disease. On his early
evening arrival in Israel, he gave a half wave upon exiting the
airplane and braved the breezes that almost blew off his white
skullcap.
</P>
<P>
   But, the site of the white-robed elder clearly energized those
who greeted him, shook his hand and smiled excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an historic moment and will be remembered in the
future,'' said Daphna Bar-Sade, the 11-year-old Jewish girl who
helped carry the bowl of soil the pope kissed. ``He looked fine for
his age.''

   NEW DELHI, India _ With her mother campaigning in New York,
Chelsea Clinton stepped into the role of substitute first lady on
Tuesday. Dressed in a gray dress and jacket, she drove with her
father to the formal arrival ceremony at the presidential palace
and, a few steps behind President Clinton, shook hands with the
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   She then took part in the president's homage to Mahatma Gandhi.
Both walked around the Gandhi bier scattering red rose petals from
a basket. Standing at a respectful distance, she watched as he
planted a flowering magnolia in the gardens of the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clinton's role in India has been underplayed by the White
House. There have been no press statements of where she has gone,
or what she has done, and reporters have been discouraged from
asking. In part, she is reacquainting herself with a country that
made a big impression on her when she came in 1995 with her mother.
Then she visited clinics and rode an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   This time some sun is also locked into the schedule. On Monday,
she did not go to Bangladesh with the president but instead flew
with her grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, to a traditional palace in
Jodhpur, where she watched the annual festivity of Holi. This is an
Indian ritual that encourages people to splash colors on one
another. The brief account of her trip to Jodhpur in the newspaper
The Hindu said that she did not ``play'' Holi. And the accompanying
photograph of her leaving the palace showed her T-shirt splatter
free.

 &HT;    Home Depot to test flooring store
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home Depot said it will begin testing a freestanding flooring
store this summer in metro Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-square-foot specialty store is the latest in a string
of growth concepts by the Atlanta-based home improvement retailer.
The name and exact location of the test store should be announced
within two weeks, said Pedro Mendiguren, vice president of
strategic business development.
</P>
<P>
   Floor-covering products have been widely successful for Home
Depot. With a steady expansion of flooring products beginning in
1996, the retailer quickly muscled past other chains as the top
seller in that sector.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's regular warehouse stores focus on lower price
points. Rugs and carpeting at the Expo stores carry a heftier price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   The new store, Mendiguren said, will sell roughly 15,000
flooring products with about 25 percent overlap of merchandise at
its existing locations. The retailer plans to hire about 30 to 35
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The store is going to cross the whole pricing range, from
entry points all the way up, although we won't sell some of the
(higher-end products) found in Expo,'' he said. Products will
include carpet, ceramic tile, laminates, wood and vinyl surfaces.
In addition, the store will sell window blinds and wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which operates more than 950 stores, has been
looking for growth outside its traditional warehouse store format
as it tries to double in size. The retailer has begun a national
rollout of Expo, its higher-priced decor chain. Last year, it
launched the Villager's Hardware chain in New Jersey, where it will
test four small-store formats.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer said it chose metro Dallas for the floor-covering
store because it has about 25 to 30 Home Depot stores and three
Expos in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a one-store test to understand how the flooring store
would affect and take market share from Home Depot and Expo
stores,'' Mendiguren said. Home Depot doesn't plan any changes to
the flooring selection inside its existing stores because of the
test, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 billion flooring industry represents a fragmented
hodgepodge of home centers, retail chains and independent showroom
dealers. Even as the top-selling flooring retailer, Home Depot
holds just a fraction of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooring business is ripe for a company like Home Depot,
which could bring some pricing credibility to the industry,'' said
analyst Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities. ``This business is
driven by rampant promotions _ 40 percent off one day, 60 percent
the next, and so on. It's very confusing for the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hood said that Home Depot has a chance to build stronger
relationships with its floor product vendors, particularly Shaw
Industries, the largest carpet maker.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot stopped carrying Shaw's products in 1996, when the
Dalton-based manufacturer began buying retail flooring stores. Shaw
was blacklisted for several years but regained shelf space at Home
Depot after it sold its retail chain to Kennesaw-based Maxim Group,
which recently changed its name to Flooring America.
</P>
<P>
   The digestion of the unprofitable Shaw stores has been a
struggle for Flooring America, though. The franchise operates about
1,000 stores, including 300 company-owned locations. Company
executives declined to comment on Tuesday about Home Depot's
specialty concept.
</P>
<P>
   While it's too early to gauge the competitive impact of Home
Depot's venture, some observers said that independents have been
holding their own in the flooring industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle has been, can a store the size of Home Depot
provide the service an independent retailer can?'' said Frank
O'Neill, publisher and editor of Floor Focus magazine. ``The
independents have discovered that they can move their stores near
Home Depot locations and do very well.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ One year after NATO began its 78-day
bombardment of Kosovo, the alliance's secretary-general issued a
report Tuesday highlighting what he said were the unsung
accomplishments of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the United States ad its NATO allies have been
fighting among themselves over how to keep a deteriorating
situation in the Serbian province of Kosovo from spinning out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   And critics of the NATO campaign have said that the bombing had
resolved little and exacerbated ethnic tensions while destroying
large parts of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia, and the bombing came as Yugoslavia refused to withdraw
troops it massed in Kosovo in response to an Albanian rebel
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In his personal report, titled ``Kosovo One Year On,'' the
secretary-general, Lord Robertson, appeared to be trying to
pre-empt a harsh review of the NATO offensive when tensions between
Serbs and the majority Albanians in Kosovo are rising again.
</P>
<P>
   He said the difficulties of the present situation should not
obscure the successes of the mission so far, including the
resettling of 1.3 million refugees, the reopening of hundreds of
schools and a drastic reduction in crime.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, the report said, there were 50 killings a week in
Kosovo. Today, there are about five a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much too early to claim a complete success,'' Lord
Robertson said at a news conference at NATO headquarters in
Brussels. ``But it is also far too early to have claimed that we
failed. No one can be satisfied with the situation in Kosovo today
but it's wrong to say that nothing is going right.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-page report, issued three days before the anniversary of
the day when the first bombs were dropped on Kosovo, said that NATO
force there has cleared mines or unexploded ordnance from more than
16,000 houses, 1,165 schools and almost 1,250 miles of roads. They
have also distributed over one million roofing tiles, 18,000 stoves
and 4,000 truckloads of firewood to Kosovo homes and villages.
</P>
<P>
   More than 43,000 people have received medical treatment at NATO
clinics in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials have grown increasingly worried
about the potential for renewed fighting in Kosovo, particularly by
Kosovo Albanian fighters using the relative security of NATO's
peacekeeping zones to carry out strikes against Serbs in Serbia,
just across the southeastern border of Kosovo.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, the State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, met
with former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group,
including Hashim Thaci and Ramush Hajradinaj, as well as
representatives of Albanian fighters from the Presevo Valley in
Serbia, to warn against such attacks. A day later, U.S. troops
raided five villages along the border, seizing weapons, ammunition
and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, NATO and Pentagon officials have been encouraged by
the willingness of Thaci and other Albanian officials to seek a
halt to cross-border raids. However, they said the NATO force in
Kosovo was not negotiating any agreement with the Albanians to end
the strikes in exchange for an easing of crackdowns like the one
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten some positive responses in words,'' the
Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said. ``What we need to see is
a positive response in actions, and only time will tell whether
they got the message and they're acting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Prague on Tuesday, the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of
the United States, rejected the contention that little had been
resolved in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of violence has come down remarkably, and what
remains is primarily organized crime and family violence,'' the
general said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea that there is a situation in Kosovo now ``that
resembles the situation before the air strikes is absolutely
incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   The general said that before the air strikes, the Serbs had
conducted a systematic government-sponsored campaign of
intimidation, repression and selective elimination of Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that there is still a high incidence of crime in the
ethnically divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica and other places in
Kosovo, but that it is lower than the crime rate in Moscow, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the NATO peacekeepers had been successful in
cutting off some of the supply lines to Kosovo Albanian
``extremists'' who were trying to stir up fighting in southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Robertson said that much work remains to be done and that
Kosovo is still in need of many resources, including funding for
U.N. projects.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   ``With inadequate money for the basic building blocks of
government _ wages for teachers, railway and municipal workers,
judges and prosecutors, for example,'' how can the U.N. entity
re-establishing civilian authorities ``establish an effective civil
administration, and exert the will of the international
community?'' he said. ``It is in the international community's
interest to provide the necessary resources, both personnel _ and
particularly police _ and funds to overcome the existing
shortfalls. Government, including NATO governments, must do more in
this respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force is currently made up of 30,000 troops
from NATO countries and 7,000 from nonmember nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community cannot leave the Kosovo job half
done,'' he said. ``This is a mission possible, but it's going to
call for patience, perseverance and resources.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Periods of snow will persist in parts of the southern Rockies as
a slow-moving storm center drifts east through southern New Mexico.
As the disturbance encounters humid air, strong thunderstorms will
erupt later Wednesday over parts of West and Central Texas.
Otherwise, clouds and scattered showers will prevail over the
southern and central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that brought locally heavy rain and some
high-elevation snow to the Middle Atlantic states will drift off
the Carolina coast. Patchy light rain will linger from southern
Virginia to the Middle Atlantic coast. Farther north, clouds will
be slow to break near the eastern Great Lakes and central
Appalachians, but high pressure will result in ample sunshine over
New England
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after some early clouds. most of the Southeast and
Ohio Valley will be mild and dry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DENVER ICE
</P>
<P>
   As residents of the Denver area waited for a spring snowstorm to
arrive Monday, the roads unexpectedly became glazed with ice. Early
in the day, the temperature several thousand feet above the ground
where precipitation was forming hovered around freezing. A light
mix of snow and rain began to fall into a shallow layer of
sub-freezing air near the ground. The raindrops froze on contact
with the cold surface. As the storm strengthened later in the day,
rising currents of air lowered temperatures at cloud level,
changing the icy mixture to just snow. &QL;

&HT;     BUSH VERSUS GOP CONGRESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There were two sharply different Republican
reactions to a National Rifle Association official's incredible
accusation that President Clinton has ``blood on his hands'' for
failing to enforce current weak, under-funded gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both responses were driven by politics, and they represented the
first important break between Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
congressional Republican leaders since he sewed up the GOP
presidential nomination on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sensibly rebuked NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre as having ``gone too far.'' Bush observed that there are
``ways to debate the issue without casting aspersions on the
president like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the right stand to take, both morally and politically. As
Bush tries to shake his right-wing image and move to the
philosophical middle, he does not want to be seen as a tool of the
NRA. As governor he opposed gun control proposals but now he
gingerly suggests he might go for some modest reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders, however, made no move to
similarly distance themselves from LaPierre's nutty outburst. They
reacted as though charging the president with being an accessory to
murder was just another commonplace insult that Clinton richly
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Their hearts are with the NRA and the lavish contributions it
pours into their campaigns, not with a president they despise and
failed to dump. Even so, they could have behaved with a little
decency.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hide was a picture of
tolerance, benignly calling LaPierre's statement ``extreme'' but
justifying it on grounds that ``it's a free country. People can say
what they want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, of course, people can indeed do that. But sane
discourse and malicious criminal accusations are different things
and require different responses from responsible officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde acknowledged that LaPierre was ``not helpful'' as Congress
struggles to find a compromise on safety locks and other gun issues
that are stalled in a congressional conference committee. ``Not
helpful'' is putting it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay was simply crass. He saw nothing
wrong with LaPierre's claim that Clinton accepted killings ``to
further his political agenda.'' DeLay blamed the fuss on a media
double standard, whining that he too had been accused of complicity
in murder _ by NRA foes _ ``but the press never picked up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``We're covering up the real problem (of
violence) here we're talking about words they are not as important
as people who want to constantly zero in on one sentence here, one
sentence there.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: It's only a word game, so who cares what is
said? Who cares that gun law enforcement is basically a state
rather than a federal responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the real problem is that there are too many guns too
readily available to too many unstable people of any age. President
Clinton himself acknowledged the need for more federal prosecutions
in his State of the Union address, proposing the hiring of more
agents and giving them tougher enforcement tools. The RNA, natch,
has opposed any more money for such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control issue will be a hot one in the fall presidential
campaign, and the split between Bush and his GOP congressional
allies could prove damaging.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier policy difference had surfaced between the candidate
who must run a national race attracting non-Republican votes and
conservative legislators who must run local races. Before it was
clear that Bush would be the nominee, GOP congressional leaders
rejected as too costly the centerpiece of his campaign, a massive
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they proposed a smaller one of their own that would not
decimate Social Security revenues. It was tailored along the lines
of a rival tax plan proposed by Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and congressional Republicans will be together on the major
goal of defeating Vice President Al Gore, but too much disagreement
on policy issues can be distracting and create the impression of a
party in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, says a new GOP poll indicates Bush may not be much help
to GOP congressional candidates. ``We can't rely on the
presidential nominee,'' Watts says. ``There's no coattails at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A lack of coattails encourages the exercise of a whole lot of
independence by those who would otherwise bow to the will of the
coat-wearer. Bush will have his hands full keeping his troops
marching in lock-step.

<P>
   ROBERT-GOBER-ART (Washington) _ Robert Gober, 46, is among the
best known of the American artists who established careers during
the late 1980s and 1990s, a time when AIDS, identity politics and
culture wars produced a surreal, gothic, dystopian sensibility in
art. His work is much in evidence this spring, both in the
traveling survey ``Robert Gober: Sculptures and Drawings'' at the
Hirshhorn and in the 2000 Biennial that opened at the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York last week. In the Hirshhorn show
in particular it is art that feels resonant with a recent past but
in tune with art shaping up in a new decade. By Holland Cotter. &QL;

   BEAU-TRAVAIL-FILM (New York) _ Dressed in a leather jacket and
jeans, the director Claire Denis, whose latest film, ``Beau
Travail,'' opens on Friday, has a casual sophistication. At 49, she
is petite, intense, reticent and, on occasion, disarmingly honest.
The daughter of a French civil servant, Ms. Denis grew up in
Cameroon in West Africa during the final days of the colonial
empire. ``Beau Travail,'' the story of a troop of French Foreign
Legionnaires, is set in present-day Djibouti, in East Africa. By
Nancy Ramsey. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   PEOPLE-OF-THE-WIND-VIDEO (Undated) _ Anthony Howarth's ``People

of Iran as they drive a million sheep, goats and pack animals into
great boulder fields, across icy turquoise rivers, upward into
mountain passes and down to vast expanses of pasture. By Peter M.

   RUSSIAN-HAMLET-BALLET (Undated) _ As far as Russian czars go,
Paul I is not exactly a household name in the West or a likely
subject for a ballet. Unlike his mother, Catherine the Great, he
was not even worth a costume drama with a film superstar (Marlene
Dietrich in ``The Scarlet Empress''). Serious historians, however,
are familiar with his turbulent life and reign in the 18th century,
and the verdict is not positive. But to the Russian choreographer
Boris Eifman, Paul was a young idealist whose spirit was broken by
the murderous court milieu that turned him into a tyrant. That, he
said, is why his new ballet, ``Russian Hamlet (the Son of Catherine
the Great),'' focuses on the youthful Paul, still to be czar. By
Anna Kisselgoff. &QL;

<P>
   JAVA-PUPPET-THEATER (Cirebon, Java) _ In Java, the world's most
populous island and the political and cultural center of Indonesia,
the traditional drama still mainly survives the way it has for
centuries: by popular demand. Itinerant puppeteers, known as
dalangs, travel from village to village, performing the ancient
tales of gods and demons, heroes and fools, for anyone with the
wherewithal to hire them. In most cultures, puppets imitate human
actors; in Java and the neighboring island of Bali, the reverse is
true. The traditional dramas have always been performed with
puppets; indeed, the Indonesian word for puppet, wayang, is used to
denote the various forms of the drama. When a piece is performed by
people, for example, it is called the wayang orang _ literally, a
human puppet show. By Jamie James. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NIETZSCHE-THEATER (Undated) _ Has Richard Foreman, 62, found his
alter ego at last? Could it be that the poor mad philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche is the perfect analogue for the playwright and
director, who for more than 30 years has been breaking the
boundaries of theater to combine the surreal, the disordered, the
mysterious and, sometimes, the just plain nutty? This year is the
centenary of Nietzsche's death, and he is the subject of Foreman's
new play, ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!,'' currently at his
Ontological-Hysteric Theater at St. Mark's Church in Manhattan. By
Dinitia Smith. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-NOISE (New York) _ Every so often, a critic feels
compelled to write a crabby column about the rudeness of audience
members. Such columns seldom do much good, but at least the critic
feels better. The traditional disruptions, like coughing, will
always be with us. But although colds afflict us all, the kind of
unabashed hacking that you hear from people who don't even seem to
be trying to control themselves has to be a passive-aggressive
expression of boredom. Some irritants are particularly exasperating
because they are so preventable. Why would a woman choose to adorn
her wrist with a clinking set of bracelets when she goes to the
opera, so that every time she fidgets in her seat or tinkers with
her Met Titles she becomes a human wind chime? Crinkling plastic
bags drive me nuts. The cell phone represents a new level of
intrusiveness. So far this season, it has been the rare concert or
opera I've attended during which at least one didn't ring. By
Anthony Tommasini. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-PHILHARMONIC (Prague, Czech Republic) _ The Czech
Philharmonic, led by its chief conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, will
give the first of three concerts this Sunday at Avery Fisher Hall
in New York City, having just completed two weeks of touring in
Florida and California. These concerts, the orchestra's first in
New York since 1996, consist mostly of Bohemian or Czech music and
are part of Lincoln Center's Prague Festival, which celebrates the
10th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and began Saturday with a
symposium on the cultural history of Prague. By James R.
Oestreich. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ZAMPA-OPERA (New York) _ ``Zampa,'' the pirate king in Ferdinand
Herrold's opera, introduced to wild acclaim at the Opera-Comique in
Paris in 1831, remained a fixture in French, Italian and German
opera houses throughout the 19th century. Today the overture is the
sole excerpt that enjoys any name recognition, and that only
barely. A whirlwind potpourri of infectious tunes from the opera,
it displays orchestration of a zest and finesse that recalls Weber,
Mendelssohn and Berlioz. On April 3, at Alice Tully Hall, a concert
revival by L'Opera Francais de New York _ with narration written
and delivered by the composer's descendant Alexander Herold
replacing the original spoken dialogue _ restores the subsequent
action in what is said to be the opera's first New York airing in
more than a hundred years. By Matthew Gurewitsch. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   JAZZ-MAINSTREAM (Undated) _ Jazz is a music of unmistakable
personalities. Though ensemble interaction between these
personalities remains one of the music's glories, the expression of
individual identity has always been the essence of jazz, with
players cultivating solo sounds as singular as fingerprints.
Increasingly, though, classic recordings by these consummate
individualists are being deployed as a sort of mood music,
background noise for everything from Broadway drama to television
hucksterism to coffee bar drinking. Some view this as a sign of
jazz's mainstreaming, its wider dissemination. Still, how
distressing it is to hear music conceived as the purest
distillation of individuality rendered so anonymously. By Barry
Singer. &QL;

<P>
   DESIGN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Design has abandoned Socrates
for Nietzsche. This is the take-away idea at the first edition of
the National Design Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. No more
pure geometric shapes. No more strict correspondences between form
and function. No more efforts to refine materials and production
methods to their pure Platonic essence. Instead, we behold room
after room of dancing stars. Fluid shapes. Appetizing colors.
Laughter in the dark. Flesh. Organized by the curatorial team of
Donald Albrecht, Ellen Lupton and Steven Skov Holt, this is the
first of a series of surveys to be conducted every three years by
the Cooper-Hewitt, the Smithsonian Institution's New York venue for
the study and exhibition of design. By Herbert Muschamp. WITH

</P>
<P>
   PRINTS-ART (Philadelphia) _ What was it that printmakers chose
to show when they depicted the ancient world? That is the question
the exhibition ``Revivals, Reveries and Reconstructions: Images of
Antiquity in Prints From 1500 to 1800,'' on view at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art until April 16, seeks to answer. Through
93 prints and 16 illustrated books, the show reveals the role
played by great masters and obscure engravers alike in the
dissemination of the ancient prototypes that were essential to
Renaissance and Baroque art. By Theodore K. Rabb. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRAUN-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ The interplay of aesthetic and
commercial concerns in the 19th century is vividly set forth in
``Image and Enterprise: The Photographs of Adolphe Braun,'' at the
Rhode Island School of Design in Providence through April 22 and at
the Cleveland Museum of Art from June 18 through Aug. 27. The first
American show to examine Braun's career, it features 100 of his
photographs, along with related material. By Vicki Goldberg. WITH

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROMAN-GLASS-ART (New York) _ A stunning variety of glass objects
in daily use in sixth century Rome incorporates virtually every
glass-working technique known today, as can be seen in ``Roman
Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change,'' an exhibition at the Bard
Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts in Manhattan,
through June 11. The 200 pieces date from the first century B.C. to
the sixth century A.D. and were selected from the university of
Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia by Stuart Fleming, the show's
curator. It is the first exhibition of the museum's collection of
ancient glass since the museum opened a century ago. By Rita Reif.

   TV-WONDERLAND (Undated) _ The scene in the opening episode of
ABC's ``Wonderland'' is harrowing. A pregnant doctor in the
emergency room of a hospital patterned after New York's Bellevue
intervenes when a violently unhinged patient tries to harm himself
with a syringe. In the scuffle that follows, the syringe pierces
the doctor's stomach. ``It's a powerful scene,'' said Lloyd Braun,
co-chairman of the ABC Television Entertainment Group. ``Like any
series that pushes the envelope _ and this one clearly does _ there
may be some people who will find the show too intense. But we
repeatedly talk at the network about how important it is to take
risks with programming. Without question, this show represents a
risk.'' The risk, of course, is that a drama about psychiatric
patients and their doctors will prove simply too unsettling to
network audiences accustomed to sitcom humor and twentysomething
angst. By Bernard Weinraub. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV-FOUNTAIN-OF-YOUTH (New York) _ ``The Fountain of Youth,''
written and directed by Orson Welles, the pilot for an anthology
series, and rarely seen, will be presented at the Museum of
Television and Radio along with an Edward R. Murrow interview and a
very funny 1956 ``I Love Lucy'' episode with Welles as guest star.
(The program begins on Friday and runs through May 7 at the museum
in New York and through May 31 in Los Angeles. By Caryn James. &QL;

MICROSOFT JOINS VENTURE TO CREATE WEB PORTAL IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The richest man in the world, Bill Gates, joined
forces Tuesday with the richest man in Latin America, Carlos Slim
Helu, in a battle to dominate the Internet in the region by
creating a portal site that combines the expertise of the Microsoft
Corp. with the communications reach of Telefonos de Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The portal site, called t1msn.com, began with 6 million users,
said Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chairman. Latin American
subscribers to Prodigy, the Internet service of Telefonos de
Mexico, or Telmex, and to Microsoft's msn.com are automatically
channeled to the new portal, except in Portuguese-speaking Brazil.
Gates said that the Web explorer program on all personal computers
with Microsoft operating software that are sold in Latin America
will have t1msn as the first port of entry to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth opportunities we have in Latin America are stronger
than anywhere,'' Gates said in announcing the venture with Slim at
a Latin America Internet conference in Miami. Slim controls Telmex,
the formerly state-owned phone company that is now his flagship
business.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, with trips and stumbles, the Internet is coming of
age in Mexico. And with that, the battle for cyberspace supremacy
has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language
broadcaster, has teamed up with USWeb/CKS, the global leader in
World Wide Web site construction, to take on the portal partnership
of Telmex and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   At first, there was talk that Televisa might join with the
Telmex venture rather than challenge it, and Televisa's president,
Emilio Azcarraga Jean, has not ruled out the possibility of joining
with Telmex in the future. With Microsoft and Telmex searching for
the best news and entertainment for the portal site, the
possibility of t1msn's contracting the services of the Televisa Web
venture is high.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Telmex officials are counting on their well-established
customer base in Mexico and infrastructure in the region, combined
with Microsoft's name and skills to give its portal a competitive
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the chief editor of Televisa's new portal, Ramon
Alberto Garza, has said that the site will build on the broadcast
empire's experience in traditional journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Slim is in a strong position. The Mexican
billionaire already owns 24 percent of Televisa's holding company
Televicentro SA.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Televisa's efforts, Slim said Tuesday that he saw his
main opponent in the country's second-largest Internet service
provider, Terra Networks Mexico SA, which is backed by Telefonica
of Spain, the biggest telecommunications provider in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Slim has made it clear that he wants to battle to the top of the
Spanish-speaking Internet market. In May 1998 he took over the
Prodigy Services Corp., then a lagging Internet service provider in
the United States, and quickly turned it into the largest Internet
provider in Mexico. In January he bought a controlling share of
CompUSA, the largest personal computer retailing chain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   To get more Mexicans online, Telmex is selling its clients
computers on affordable monthly installments charged to the
customers' telephone bills. The deal includes free Internet access
provided by Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   But Slim is still hindered by the country's telephone network _
10.8 million lines for nearly 100 million people. Telmex has
announced plans to install 10 million new phone lines this year,
and it will promote its Internet services to every new subscriber.

BEIJING SEES TAIWAN AS MAIN ISSUE IN U.S.-CHINESE TIES, SAYS
HOLBROOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy to the United
Nations, concluded two days of talks here Tuesday with Chinese
officials on issues ranging from the world forum's economic
restructuring to its role in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese officials quickly turned the discussion to Taiwan,
where on Saturday a candidate whom Beijing opposed for his
longstanding promotion of the island's independence won the
presidency and ended more than a half century of Nationalist rule.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunited
with the mainland, and has threatened to use force to block its
formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese made it clear to us that the central issue in
Sino-U.S. relations from their point of view was Taiwan,'' said
Holbrooke, who was joined on the trip by Stanley Roth, the State
Department's top official on East Asia. He said the national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, would arrive in Beijing next week
for more talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the Taiwan election, China's top
leaders mounted a menacing propaganda campaign against Chen
Shui-bian, whose Democratic Progressive Party's platform supports
independence for Taiwan. Chen himself has backed away from that
position, arguing that a formal declaration would be unnecessary,
given Taiwan's de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   But since Chen's election, Beijing's reaction has been more
muted, and Holbrooke on Tuesday praised the ``cautious and prudent
approach that the Chinese emphasized in their discussions'' with
his delegation.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Chinese officials were appreciative that President
Clinton had reaffirmed Washington's longstanding position that
Taiwan and the mainland are part of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Chen and Chinese President Jiang Zemin have floated
trial balloons in their own media concerning the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Jiang said that Taiwan must accept that it is an
inseparable part of one China as a pre-requisite for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, Chen told reporters said he wanted to renew talks
with the mainland and was willing to discuss the principle of ``One
China,'' but not as a starting point for discussions.

   USAIRWAYS-UNION (Undated) _ The unionized flight attendants at
US Airways are threatening an unusual walkout beginning this
Saturday _ they say they will disrupt 49 of the airline's busiest
routes. The flight attendants, who are waiting for a mandatory
30-day cooling off period to end at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, want to
maximize pressure on the company with a strategy they have dubbed
CHAOS _ Create Havoc Around Our System. In response, US Airways,
the nation's sixth-largest airline, plans to take an unusual step
of its own, saying that unless a contract is reached by Saturday,
it would suspend all its operations, rather than let the flight
attendants whipsaw the company and its customers. By Steven

&HT;     FDA WIELDS A BIG STICK OVER MANY PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: SUBS 3rdgraf to add year agency created)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration does not have the
authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug, the Supreme
Court ruled Tuesday, but the agency still has sweeping power over
what is manufactured, sold and eaten in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those products include corn, Viagra, cosmetics, animal
antibiotics, pacemakers, breast implants and CD players.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, which is one of the nation's oldest consumer-protection
agencies, traces its genesis to a 1848 law requiring the inspection
of foreign-made drugs imported into the country. The modern
agency's authority was created by a 1938 law and the FDA's power
has grown considerably since then.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is responsible for monitoring the manufacture,
import, transport, storage, and sale of $1 trillion worth of goods
annually. It has some 1,100 investigators and inspectors who police
15,000 facilities a year as part of the regulatory oversight over
95,000 U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 9,000 employees in 157 cities, the core of the
FDA is its scientific firepower: 2,100 scientists, including 900
chemists and 300 microbiologists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA, about 3,000 products a year are deemed
unfit for consumers and are withdrawn from the marketplace, either
by voluntarily or by court-ordered seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has different regulatory powers depending on the
product. For example, with drugs and medical devices, it has fairly
broad authority to assess whether a new product should be allowed
on the market. It relies on the manufacturers to provide studies
that prove the product meets the stringent threshold of being
``safe and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the medical devices area, the FDA has different
regulation standards depending on the product's risk to the public.
For example, devices that are life-supporting, life-sustaining or
surgically put in the human body, such as pacemakers and breast
implants, must receive agency approval before they can be marketed.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has power over the food supply. Its scientists regularly
test whether pesticide residue and other harmful agents are present
in unhealthy amounts. It sets labeling standards to let consumers
assess the nutritional value of foods. And the agency ensures that
the drugs given to animals _ especially those animals that wind up
in the food supply _ are safe for humans.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is a key federal player in policing the nation's blood
supply. Investigators examine blood bank operations for
contaminants and poor record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics also come under FDA's umbrella. However, the FDA is
only able to regulate them after they go on the market. But the
agency can order unsafe cosmetics removed from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Products that emit radiation are the FDA's responsibility. These
include medical products such as X-Ray machines and consumer
products such as microwave ovens, sunlamps and CD and DVD players.
The FDA helps set federal standards for the amount of radiation
that is safe and can order unsafe products removed from the market.

`ROMEO': TOO FEW STUNTS, TOO MUCH TALK

   Romeo Must Die. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. Written by Eric
Bernt and John Jarrell. Cast: Jet Li, Aaliyah, Delroy Lindo,
Russell Wong, Isaiah Washington. Warner Bros. 110 minutes. Rated R
for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The current wisdom in Hollywood is that audiences are bored
stiff with mindless action movies that offer nothing but a string
of explosions and karate kicks. The new look in action is a film
like ``The Matrix,'' which gives us not just mayhem but a certain
depth of character, an intriguing story premise and
state-of-the-art special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese martial-arts star Jet Li's latest Hollywood movie,
``Romeo Must Die'' _ which advertises itself as being ``from the
producer of `The Matrix''' (Joel Silver) _ has this new look: it
has more characters than ``War and Peace,'' it borrows its plot
from Shakespeare and it throws in special effects in its chopsocky
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But, this time, it doesn't quite work. The film's handful of
action sequences are terrific, but the script is simply not
substantial enough to support the bewildering plot, nor is Li actor
(or movie-star presence) enough to carry it. After a while, it
seems excruciatingly talky, and you find yourself nodding off in
the lengthy spaces between body blows.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a wink at ``Romeo and Juliet'' (or, more properly,
``West Side Story''), set against a gang war that breaks out
between an African American mob and a Chinese mob when a business
tycoon decides to buy up _ as the site of a new NFL football
stadium _ the Oakland waterfront they share as their joint turf.
</P>
<P>
   When the youngest son of the Chinese Godfather is murdered, his
older brother (Li) escapes from a Hong Kong prison, sneaks into the
U.S., inserts himself in the midst of the war and, in the process,
gradually falls for the beautiful daughter (Aaliyah) of the black
leader (Delroy Lindo).
</P>
<P>
   As befits the first directorial effort of noted cinematographer
Andrzej Bartkowiak (``Speed,'' ``Terms of Endearment''), it's an
ambitious movie. And a fair share of it works, including most of
the action, a wall-to-wall hip-hop score, some of the comedy relief
from Anthony Anderson (of TV's ``Hang Time''), and the performances
of the always-reliable Lindo and of newcomer Aaliyah, a
recording-star-turned-actress who is, by far, the brightest thing
in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the fight scenes are amazingly few and far
between, the special effects (X-rays of crunching bones in the
midst of the action) are low-impact and silly, the plot is
near-impossible to follow and star Li's limitations as an actor are
constantly calling attention to themselves. In fact, when not
kicking butt, he's kind of a blank spot in the center of the
screen.

PALESTINIANS, ISRAELIS MEET TO DISCUSS `FINAL STATUS' PEACE
ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Se also ISRAEL-WESTBANK, POPE-HOLYLAND)

 By NEIL A LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With much of the Middle East focused on President
Clinton's upcoming meeting in Geneva with President Hafez Assad of
Syria, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators Tuesday quietly began
conferring here on a separate but equally critical series of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are working against a
September 13 target date to reach agreement on some of the most
difficult issues in any settlement between the two sides. The
negotiations, which are expected to last about a week and are
taking place at Bolling Air Force Base on the edge of the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   They involve what diplomats have called the ``final status''
issues, including defining the Palestinian territories, Jewish
settlements, the identity of Jerusalem, water rights, refugees and
Palestinian statehood.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this process to take a substantial amount of time to
overcome differences on these profound issues and therefore we
don't expect there to be early breakthroughs,'' said the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the high-profile and ultimately unsuccessful negotiations
between Syria and Israel that took place under American auspices in
January in West Virginia, the new Israeli-Palestinian round is
expected to attract little attention. One reason, said an American
diplomat, is that both Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright are out of the country, visiting South Asia. Clinton is to
meet the Syrian president on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that, ``The goal is for it to be a serious
brainstorming session where the parties can really talk about the
issues in a more free-flowing fashion than they have been able to
do to date.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday to the Young Leadership Conference of the
United Jewish Communities, Rubin said that the administration
wanted the current round of talks to take place ``at a site away
from the limelight, away from the media where the two sides can
talk and we can talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in the speech that time is running short.
</P>
<P>
   ``But think of the potential results,'' he said. ``If this were
achieved, we know that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is at the
core of the Middle East problem. And if we could resolve this core
issue, once and for all, it would make a profound difference to the
lives of not only the Palestinians and the Israelis but Israel's
entire role in the region.''

CITIBANK FILLS TWO IMPORTANT EXECUTIVE POSITIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to fill two high-profile positions that were
recently vacated, Citigroup, the nation's largest financial
services concern, appointed a new chief financial officer and a new
chairman of its consumer and commercial banking unit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said that Todd Thomson, who previously ran the
company's private banking arm, will immediately begin serving as
the chief financial officer, replacing Heidi G. Miller, who left
Citigroup last month for the chief financial officer's post at
Priceline.com, an Internet commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup also said that Victor J. Menezes will succeed John S.
Reed as chairman and chief executive of Citibank, the company's
consumer and commercial banking arm. Menezes, who will continue as
co-head of Citigroup's investment banking unit, will succeed Reed
on April 18, after the company's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 61, surprised the banking industry last month when he
announced that he would retire as co-chief executive of Citigroup
after the annual meeting. Reed's retirement plans, which will leave
Sanford I. Weill, 66, as sole chief executive of Citigroup,
generated wide-ranging speculation about who will emerge as Weill's
eventual successor.
</P>
<P>
   Weill declined to comment Tuesday about the succession issue,
but praised the abilities of Thomson and Menezes. While Thompson
and Menezes are also well-regarded by banking analysts, neither of
the executives are considered strong candidates to succeed Weill
when he retires. Weill has suggested that he might retire in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a major reshuffling of the chairs,'' said Michael
Mayo, a banking analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, of the job
changes at Citigroup. ``Rather, it's a fine-tuning of the existing
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts consider Menezes, 50, to be an extremely
capable manager they say he lacks the charisma and stature needed
to run a company as sprawling, influential, and complex as
Citigroup. Thompson, who is only 39, is a relative newcomer to
Citigroup, having joined the company just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup also said Tuesday that it plans to buy all of the
outstanding shares of its insurance unit, Travelers Property
Casualty, that it does not already own _ a move some analysts
believe could signal Citigroup's intention to expand its insurance
operations through acquisitions. Such an expansion would be made
much easier once Citigroup controls all of Travelers' shares.
Citigroup currently owns about 85 percent of Travelers' stock and
said it will purchase the remaining Travelers stock for $41.50 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday,
Citigroup's shares rose $1.875, or 3.3 percent, to $58.0625, on a
generally good day for most bank stocks.

<P>
   BANE, Nigeria _ ``I'm not happy, I'm not a happy man,'' said Jim
Beeson Wiwa, 94, standing in a field here where he hopes to build a
monument for the son whose remains he has yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   His son, the celebrated author Ken Saro-Wiwa, was hanged nearly
five years ago by Nigeria's military rulers, whom he had criticized
fiercely and fearlessly. His executioners dumped his body in an
unmarked, common grave in the eastern city of Port Harcourt.
Nigerians knew the grave lay not too far from the prison where he
had been killed, though the government kept its exact location a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected death of the dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, in June
1998 led the way to greater openness in Nigeria. The newly elected
president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who had narrowly escaped death
himself during three years in Abacha's prisons, immediately gave
Saro-Wiwa's family permission to exhume the body for a proper
funeral. But that was not the end of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa's remains are still in the unmarked grave,
intermingled with those of eight other Ogoni men who were also
hanged. Because of a dispute between the author's family and the
relatives of the eight men, a burial scheduled by Saro-Wiwa's
family for April 24 appears very unlikely to take place.
</P>
<P>
   When the government yielded, Saro-Wiwa's Ogoni people _ who sit
on billions of dollars in oil reserves but have remained
desperately poor, like the rest of the people in the Niger Delta _
rejoiced. Their champion would finally be buried in a ceremony
befitting a man who had become a martyr in the struggle for
democracy, along with others like the late opposition leader,
Moshood K.O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in the writer's hometown, a village of mud houses about an
hour's drive from Port Harcourt, his father and his mother, Wiidu,
showed a visitor the field where they plan to bury their son. Wiwa
waved his cane at the acres of trees he wants cleared for the
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Abacha died, they took his body to Kano,'' Wiwa said,
mentioning the general's hometown. ``When Abiola died, they took
him to Yorubaland. Why should they not give me my own son to bring
to Bane?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that divisions have afflicted the Ogoni
people, or the organization that Saro-Wiwa founded in 1990, the
Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, known as Mosop. In
many ways, those divisions are a microcosm of those among the 7
million people of the oil-producing Niger Delta, in the southern
part of the country. The delta residents have shared the same
complaints against Nigeria's federal government but have been
hopelessly unable to unite behind them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Abacha, security forces simply crushed any unrest in the
delta. The lands inhabited by half a million Ogoni were occupied
for years by soldiers, who attacked their villages, killing men,
raping women and burning down homes. The troops left Ogoniland a
few months after Abacha's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there is no harassment now,'' said Des Alonale
Laka, an official with the organization. ``But what Mosop stands
for we have not achieved yet.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has pledged to help achieve the goals of developing the
delta. The region produces almost all of Nigeria's crude oil. But
successive military governments dominated by northerners have kept
it severely underdeveloped, with few roads and almost no
electricity and running water.
</P>
<P>
   The rulers apparently believed that an impoverished and divided
delta would be less likely to press for secession, a constant worry
in a country with as many as 400 ethnic groups. In this vacuum,
European and U.S. oil companies became virtual states within a
state.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the elected government's main effort has been a
Niger Delta development bill that has been finding its way slowly
through the national legislature. The bill would set up a committee
responsible for building up the region, putting in more money than
the delta has ever received.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the people of the delta, especially its young men,
have grown restive. A few months ago, in a town called Odi, some
youths from another ethnic group, the Ijaw, killed 12 police
officers. Obasanjo responded by sending in troops, who destroyed
Odi and killed dozens of its residents; he later approved $50
million worth of emergency projects.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa, a playwright, television producer and poet, was the
Niger Delta's most passionate and forceful voice. He demanded that
it receive a bigger share of the country's oil revenues, which had
filled the pockets of Nigeria's rulers for decades. He accused
Royal Dutch Shell, which pumped the oil in Ogoniland and half of
Nigeria's, of destroying the environment and supporting the
military in suppressing the delta people _ charges that Shell has
denied over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with growing protests and vandalism, Shell shuttered its
operations in Ogoniland in 1993 and has not been back since. In
1994, after four moderate Ogoni chiefs were killed by a mob,
Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni men were indicted on murder charges,
which they denied. A kangaroo court convicted him and eight others
a year later. Despite international calls for clemency, the Abacha
government ordered them executed in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The executions marked a turning point for Nigeria, which became
isolated from the world and slid deeper into a morass from which it
is still trying to raise itself.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks after Obasanjo was inaugurated as president
last May, Owens Wiwa, the author's younger brother, met the new
president in the capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Obasanjo gave an executive order that the bodies of
the Ogoni men should be given back to their families,'' Owens said
in a telephone interview from Toronto, where he still lives in
exile. ``Normally, in Nigeria, if you are hanged for murder, the
body is kept by the government. But everyone knows that they were
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new openness, divisions have persisted among the
Ogoni. This time the dispute seems to center on the control over
the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, pitting
Saro-Wiwa's family against the organization's leadership, headed by
its president, Ledum Mtee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a dent not only to the movement,'' Mtee said of the
squabble, ``but also to the sacrifice that Ken and the others
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting spilled over into the burial plans. Owens Wiwa
wanted to have the remains of his brother and the other eight Ogoni
men exhumed. American pathologists had been set to travel to
Nigeria last month to conduct tests to determine the identities of
the remains in the common grave.
</P>
<P>
   But the families of the other eight, who are close to the
group's leadership, protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not consulted,'' said Lucky Dobee, whose older
brother, Saturday Dobee, was hanged with the author. ``They said
that the corpses would be given to the individual families. Where
are we to keep the corpses? No shelter. No money.''
</P>
<P>
   The families had been informed and offered help from Ken
Saro-Wiwa's family, Owens Wiwa said, accusing the organization's
leadership of creating divisions so that it could have full control
over the burial.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Poromon, a Methodist bishop who was appointed by the
organization to lead a burial committee for the Ogoni men, shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men did not die for their families _ they died for
Ogoni,'' Poromon said. ``We are not happy about this. But we are
seeing how we can resolve this.''

SAT SCORES ARE NO GAUGE FOR LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was applying to college, Bill Bradley scored a 485 on
the verbal portion of his SAT's, the intellectual equivalent of a
night of air balls on the basketball court. George W. Bush, often
portrayed as a cerebral lightweight, registered a gentleman's 566 _
hardly enough to predict that he would one day be the Republican
nominee for leader of the free world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one has shown that intellectual prowess is a
prerequisite for the presidency. With some voters, it might be a
liability, as it was for Adlai E. Stevenson, who was maligned as an
egghead in his race against Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the scores by Bradley and Bush seem to offer two more
pieces of evidence that the SAT is not an exceptional predictor of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley graduated from Princeton with honors, became a Rhodes
Scholar and went on to become a U.S. States senator. When he
dropped out of the presidential race, he did so with a graceful
allusion to Proust's ``Remembrance of Things Past.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's acceptance to Yale may have been helped by his ancestry
and connections, but he has still done what many consider a
credible job running Texas, winning laurels for his leadership in
education.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between these men's accomplishments and their
scores provides ammunition for the perennial assault on the SAT.
One of the loudest shots came last fall with ``The Big Test: The
Secret History of the American Meritocracy'' (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux) by Nicholas Lemann. It argued that the SAT replaced an
aristocracy of wealth and breeding with an equally distorted one
purportedly based on academic talent, generating a new elite that
undermined equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one could ask, what is so bad about trying to replace
an aristocracy with a meritocracy? We would hardly want our best
law firms and science laboratories run by mediocre students just as
few of us would pay $100 a ticket to see a minor league team play
in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the SAT has real flaws. It can be
coached, giving moneyed students an advantage. It underrepresents
some groups (though others, like Jews and Asian-Americans, would
say it opened once-closed doors for them). It is best at predicting
only first-year college grades. It is an excruciating,
time-consuming exercise. And, if Lemann is right, it helps select
an elite more focused on money and power than public service.
</P>
<P>
   The reason colleges do not get rid of the SAT, however, is that
we live in a country obsessed with local educational control. There
is no national curriculum, nor are there national standards.
Selective colleges have no yardstick to discriminate between a B
average in a pampered, competitive high school larded with Advanced
Placement courses and an A at a high school in the Badlands of
South Dakota that does not offer physics. Colleges need the SAT to
help them unearth a promising student at that unsung Dakota high
school.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if there were no SAT, colleges would have to
invent something like it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has been a long time since the SAT's were seen as
accurate indexes of talent like batting averages. In the last
generation, colleges, pushing for racially diverse and well-rounded
student bodies, have purposefully searched for other ways of
deciphering the mystery of what an application really says about
the flesh-and-blood student behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The best colleges are so selective that they end up having
students with extremely high SAT's. But that is not the same thing
as saying they choose the students based on their SAT's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn down lots of students with very high SAT's, and we
admit some students with very low SAT's.'' said George Rupp,
Columbia's president. ``There's no cutoff point.''
</P>
<P>
   But universities like Columbia insist upon an SAT as part of an
application because it helps them gauge the worth of more
subjective factors like grades and teacher recommendations. At the
same time, it helps them screen out high-grade students who do not
have the vocabulary or cannot do the abstract reasoning needed for
complex courses in literature or philosophy ( Bradley being a
striking anomaly).
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make quite low SAT's would have difficulty dealing
with complicated questions in class,'' said John A. Blackburn, dean
of admissions at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are many colleges that, preoccupied with their
ratings in U.S. News &AMP; World Report, place far too much weight on
SAT scores and reject promising students who might have been
worthwhile gambles. The best colleges, though, are mindful that if
they selected students largely based on their SAT's, they would not
have as lively, offbeat and engaging a flock of students, maybe not
even the kind of students who might one day be good at running the
country.

   NEW YORK _ Ron Havilio had a lovely idea. Capture the history of
Jerusalem, where he was born in 1950, on film, mixing it with the
history of his own family, which traces its history there for
centuries. The resulting work is ``Fragments: Jerusalem,'' a
six-hour film being shown at the New Directors/New Films series
Wednesday through April 6. It is worthy and ambitious but somewhat
soporific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragments: Jerusalem'' is divided into seven sections ranging
from 34 to 66 minutes each. It begins with ``Mamila,'' a look at
the neighborhood of that name outside the Old City walls, and ends
with ``Abba (Father),'' the story of the filmmaker's father, who
joined the Haganah underground, struggling for the creation of a
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Havilio, who also lived in Paris, Istanbul and Africa (his
father was at one point Israel's consul general) while growing up,
had some wonderful raw material for a film or mini-series, but that
is exactly what it remains. ``Fragments: Jerusalem'' desperately
needs shaping and focusing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the division into seven sections, the story has no
apparent structure. Havilio, who narrates the English version
(there are English subtitles when the subject on screen speaks
Hebrew or French), often switches from a historical narrative about
his homeland to home movies, largely of his wife and his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   This could have worked, but the connections between subjects are
often unclear. At one point, Havilio films his wife wiggling her
toes.
</P>
<P>
   There are some very pretty pictures of Jerusalem, past and
present, in the film. The snowstorm in Chapter 5 is particularly
gorgeous. The scenes with ancient structures in their contemporary
surroundings as cars whiz by, contrasted with earlier photographs
or sketches, work nicely. But it takes more than 16-millimeter
travelogue photography, stream of consciousness and good intentions
to make a meaningful documentary, and that is all ``Fragments:
Jerusalem'' has to offer.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since his childhood in Syosset on Long Island, all
Adam Pascal ever wanted to be was a rock singer. He dreamed of
fronting his own band and writing his own music. Though Billy Joel
was his idol as a singer, hard rock became his passion.
</P>
<P>
   But while pursuing that fantasy an unexpected detour came along
called ``Rent.'' Though he had never acted, Pascal was cast in the
lead role, the HIV-infected punk rocker and recovering addict Roger
Davis, in the original 1996 production of Jonathan Larson's
breakthrough musical at the New York Theater Workshop. When the
show moved to Broadway later that year, Pascal's work landed him on
the cover of Newsweek (a steamy photo with his co-star, Daphne
Rubin-Vega) and earned him a Tony Award nomination for best actor
in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Though gratified by the success, Pascal assumed that ``Rent''
would be his first and only theater gig. Surely now, he thought,
offers from record companies would come.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. Pascal, the reluctant Broadway
star, finds himself again in a lead role of a new musical, the
Disney-produced ``Aida,'' loosely based on the Verdi opera, with
music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice. Pascal plays Radames,
the commander of the Egyptian army, who is engaged to Amneris, an
Egyptian princess (Sherie Rene Scott), but falls in love, fatally
it turns out, with Aida (Heather Headley), a Nubian princess
captured and enslaved by the Egyptians. Directed by Robert Falls,
``Aida'' opens in New York on Wednesday at the Palace Theater at
Broadway and 47th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal had to be persuaded to take the role. But during a recent
interview at the theater, he seemed excited to be involved with the
show and at peace with his quixotic career. Moreover, a collection
of 12 of his rock songs is being released on the Internet by
Sh-K-Boom Records in late spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all music I've written myself,'' he said, out of breath
from having bounded up four flights of metal stairs to his
ramshackle dressing room at the former vaudeville house. A session
of notes with the director had detained him. ``This record is the
first time I've allowed myself to write music purely, without
trying to direct it to a certain audience,'' he added. ``Whether
people like it or not, I feel a huge sense of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roger in ``Rent,'' he was praised for the volatile anger,
exuberance and punky charisma he projected. On this busy day,
dressed in black jogging pants, an army-green thermal undershirt
and a cap from God's Love We Deliver, the organization that brings
hot meals to people with AIDS, Pascal, 29, was all optimism and
openness. Yet recalling the frustrations he faced after ``Rent''
rekindled his exasperation with the pigeonholing that pervades the
rock and pop industry. ``For a while there I worried that I had
fallen into this strange trap,'' Pascal said. After he left the
cast of ``Rent'' in late 1997, he formed the short-lived five-piece
Adam Pascal Band, which had a burst of success playing rock clubs
around Manhattan. ``We were doing great,'' he said, ``playing to
kids, 400 and 500 kids at a time, who really dug the music. But a
lot of rock people, producers and managers, looked at me and said,
`He's a theater guy.' We couldn't get them to come hear us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he accepted innumerable invitations to try out for roles
in television and film. ``It was a miserable experience,'' he said.
``I went into these auditions where people had big expectations of
me. Everyone would say, `I'm such a big fan, I'm really happy to
meet you, blah, blah, blah.' Then I'd do this bad audition. My lack
of experience came through. I felt like I was letting everyone
down, including myself. I realized I'm not interested in the
Hollywood-actor-boy thing. What I can offer is my singing.''
</P>
<P>
   That he can. When Bernard Telsey, the casting agent for ``Rent''
(and for ``Aida''), discovered Pascal singing in a grungy rock club
in 1995, he knew immediately that he had found an ideal Roger.
``Adam is raw, sexy, exciting, available,'' Telsey said recently.
``He really reaches audiences. So it's worth whatever course a
director has to go through to get him to do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greif, the director of ``Rent,'' was equally floored
when Pascal auditioned. ``He showed up with the tools, that
incredible voice, the ability to focus on intention,'' Grief
recalled. ``He had never done a play, but he had great instincts,
huge accessibility and could go very deeply from profound despair
to extraordinary joy.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``incredible voice'' was apparently a natural gift, evident
from the time Pascal was 11 and first tried singing with a
makeshift rock band some young friends had gotten together. With no
formal musical training, Pascal picks out his songs on the guitar.
He has never taken voice lessons, though he got some tips from a
professionally trained singer who was a colleague at a New York
fitness club where Pascal worked as a personal trainer. (It was a
job he kept for several months after ``Rent'' opened, fearing that,
as he put it, the ``whole thing might burst.'')
</P>
<P>
   He credits Tim Weil, the musical director of ``Rent,'' with
giving him a helpful regimen of warm-up scales and exercises. From
Weil he also learned the importance of enunciation, something that
most rock singers ignore in favor of the trademark rock mumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enunciation is a musical theater trick,'' Pascal said. ``If
you're having trouble getting a note, Tim told me, instead of
pushing, just say the word clearly and the note will be there.''
Pascal regrets the strain he put his voice through in smoky,
blaring rock clubs. ``Now I'm better aware of what I can and can't
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he can do vocally has been widely hailed by critics. His
voice is by turns plaintive and powerful, melting and earthy. And
he can modulate his sound, singing with focused, lean tone one
moment and thick, trembling vibrato the next.
</P>
<P>
   He is unfazed that his two Broadway roles have been based on
operatic characters. He has never seen Puccini's ``Boheme,'' the
inspiration for ``Rent,'' or ``Aida.'' Nor has he listened to
recordings. ``It's kind of irrelevant,'' he said. ``I didn't want
to taint my ideas about what `Rent' and `Aida' were about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no opera fan, he is ``a fan of these wonderful opera
stories,'' he added. ``Good stories are hard to come by. It's
important to keep telling them in new ways.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pascal is happy with the progress of his career. And
his life: his wife of just over a year, Cybele Pascal, is a
playwright finishing a master's degree at Columbia University. As
for his rock 'n' roll fantasy, Pascal said that his recording's
release on an Internet rather than a major commercial label does
not bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a distribution deal is difficult, to say the least,''
he said. ``Besides, they take all your money. The fans I have from
`Rent' stay in touch on the Internet. So this is the best way to
reach them.'' And he is thrilled, he said, to be part of a
cutting-edge innovation in the music industry. ``If a situation
came along where we could get the record into the stores, we'd do
that as well,'' he said. ``But it's not a reason to sell your soul
to a distribution company.''
</P>
<P>
   If rock stardom eludes him, so be it, Pascal declares. ``I have
allowed myself to realize that I love doing musical theater,'' he
said. ``As long as I can do exciting new projects, I'll probably
continue.''

STOCKS REBOUND BROADLY DESPITE FED'S RATE HIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FED-MARKETPLACE and FED-RATES) 
(bl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad, strong rally Tuesday
even though the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest
rates and gave every indication it was prepared to do so again in
about two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision to raise the overnight federal funds rate, to
6 percent from 5.75 percent, had been widely anticipated. Indeed,
some traders said there had been a concern that the central bank
might have done something more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something of a relief rally,'' said Bob Gasser, head
of U.S. equity trading at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``But the
implications of the move won't be known for about six weeks, when
minutes from the meeting are published.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the old- and new-economy companies posted strong gains, and
the leading market indexes all registered gains of 2 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,907.34, up 227.10,
or 2.13 percent. Since March 14, the blue chip index has gained
more than 1,000 points. Still, so far this year the Dow is down a
bit more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow, 21 posted price gains,
while only eight fell in value.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 37.24, or 2.6
percent, to 1,493.87, its first record of the year. In addition to
General Electric, technology companies like Cisco Systems, which
gained 6 47/64, to 140 55/64, and Yahoo, which jumped 19 47/64, to
191}, helped to push the index higher. For the first time this
year, the S&AMP;P is now higher than it was at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which was down by more than 100
points early in the session, staged a turnaround and gained 101.68,
or 2.2 percent, to 4,711.68. And the Wilshire 5000 index rose
292.98, or 2.1 percent, to 14,346.22.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was brisk, but not hectic.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 1 billion shares changed hands.
Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.7 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the reversal in the Internet and technology
stocks that trade on the Nasdaq halted what has been the second
major correction that market has experienced so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This selloff has not been a panic,'' said Robert E. Turner,
chairman and chief investment officer at Turner Investment
Partners, a Berwyn, Pa. firm that has $10 billion under management,
much of it in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big correction, but nothing more than that. It gives
everyone a better chance to evaluate what is out there, and
presents good opportunities to buy the better stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in General Electric's stock price came after the
company announced that its first quarter profits will ``modestly
exceed'' Wall Street consensus estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and financial-services stocks had a good day. Analysts have
been saying that bank stocks, which have fallen sharply since the
Fed began raising interest rates in late June, would begin to rally
when it appeared the central bank might be about finished pushing
them up.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P Major Regional Bank index gained 5.2 percent Tuesday.
Wells Fargo rose 1|, to 39 9/16. Mellon Financial was up 1|, to
32{. And Fleet Boston Financial rose 2 to 34[.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial service stocks, Goldman Sachs gained 4 13/16, to
118\, after the investment bank posted first quarter results that
were much better than expected.

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Even Tuesday night, three days after an
opposition candidate was elected president, ending more than 50
years of Nationalist rule, Hsieh Tsung-min could barely contain his
elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream has come true,'' said Hsieh, 64, an early hero of the
democracy and independence movement on this island, to which Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalist forces fled from mainland China in 1949
after their defeat by the Communists. The Nationalists imposed
martial law and a dictatorship on the native Taiwanese population;
it was lifted only in the late 1980s, by Chiang's son and
successor, Chiang Ching-kuo.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, native dissidents like Hsieh fought a hard battle
for civil rights in what was often called the Taiwan independence
movement. Convicted of treason in 1964 for drafting a ``Declaration
for the Taiwanese People,'' he spent a total of 11 and a half
torture-filled years in prison, went into exile in the United
States and then returned here in 1990 to join the offspring of his
cause, the Democratic Progressive Party _ the party of Sunday's
victor, Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
   Today Hsieh is not bothered by President-elect Chen's
backtracking on the need to declare Taiwan's independence,
backtracking aimed at broadening the party's election appeal and
avoiding a military blitz from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has really come to Taiwan,'' Hsieh said, ``and in
Taiwan, democracy means independence. But we must be practical and
careful in our dealings with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hero of the native Taiwanese cause said Tuesday that he,
too, was happy about Chen's election, but only up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian's victory is a great step, but I feel my wish
has been compromised,'' said Koo Kwang-ming, 74, who spent decades
in exile in Japan promoting his Taiwan Independence Union, while
under indictment at home for treason. Chiang Kai-shek, like his
arch-rival Mao Tse-tung on the mainland, allowed no dissent from
the view that Taiwan was a Chinese province, even as the two
leaders disagreed whether Beijing or Taipei was China's rightful
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for us to do is to declare independence before
China becomes too strong,'' Koo said. ``Democracy is possible
anywhere, but if you forget you are a son of this land, then
democracy becomes meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hsieh and Koo fought for the native-born Taiwanese against
their Nationalist rulers. But in their contrasting approaches _
Hsieh stressing democracy and willing to relax on formal
independence, Koo a die-hard advocate of a Taiwan Republic _ are
the roots of a continuing debate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Taiwan's peculiar history, the issues of democracy
and independence have been intertwined, and differences in emphasis
have from the beginning bedeviled the newly emergent Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   To many abroad, it is simply known as Taiwan's pro-independence
party. And that is an important strand in its makeup.
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of this Taiwanese opposition party in the
mid-1980s _ even before martial law was lifted in 1987 _ was driven
more by the quest for democracy and ethnic justice than for legal
independence from the mainland, said Sherry Rigger, an expert on
Taiwan politics at Davidson College in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   During the just-concluded election campaign, Chen spent much of
his time not promoting independence but trying to convince voters,
and foreign governments, that he was realistic and would not
provoke a crisis with Beijing. Ethnic Taiwanese with strongly
pro-independence views were certain to vote for him in any case,
but Chen's main plank was the fight against the dirty money and
politics of the encrusted Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, the Democratic Progressive Party has been
riven by internal struggles between hard-core promoters of
independence and pragmatists like Chen, who knew that regardless of
personal preferences, the party had to align itself with the
mainstream electorate on cross-strait relations in order to win
national office.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have consistently shown that the vast majority of voters
want to keep things as they are now, with Taiwan sovereign in
practice if not in name, and that only a small fraction wants the
government to openly defy Beijing with a declaration of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong independence position was a kind of phase that
people went through,'' Rigger said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the Nationalists lifted martial law, moved toward
democracy and made the native Taiwanese Lee Teng-hui the national
leader, the young opposition party groped for a message, Rigger
said. In the first direct presidential election, in 1996, it put up
a candidate some here call the godfather of independence, Peng
Ming-min, who was Hsieh's law professor and had also been
imprisoned in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Peng failed miserably, picking up just 21 percent of the vote.
In the aftermath, pragmatists like Chen steered the party toward
domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fervent independence advocates _ with funds from the wealthy
Koo, who had previously bankrolled the Democratic Progressives _
split off to form the small Taiwan Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in the latest sign that party moderates want to
minimize friction with the mainland, a legislator proposed formally
altering the party's basic statement of principles to remove its
provocative calls for rewriting the constitution and declaring a
Republic of Taiwan. Instead, the legislator suggested, it should
assert Taiwan's status as a ``sovereign independent country.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Chen will risk a contentious debate over the party's
charter is unclear, and, in any case, even the revised formulation
would remain objectionable in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But the airing of such a proposal shows how far the Democratic
Progressives have converged with the Nationalists on cross-strait
policy _ leaving the situation dangerous but not, perhaps, as
immediately explosive as many feared.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since his victory on Saturday, with 39 percent of the vote in a
three-way race, Chen has gone out of his way to avoid baiting
China.
</P>
<P>
   This week, there was some grumbling from independence supporters
within the leadership of the Democratic Progressives, as well as
among partial allies like Koo. But Chen and his aides know that his
most pressing immediate task, assuming that he can avoid fanning
the flames with China, is to find qualified people to run the
government and to patch together a coalition in the legislature,
which remains dominated by the Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, for his part, does not directly criticize Chen for watering
down calls for independence. ``He was a lot better than the other
two candidates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he still insists that Taiwan ought to declare independence
while it has the chance. ``Do you really think China would
attack?'' he asked. ``They would lose their external trade, and the
first thing to collapse would be the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsieh, by contrast, says there is no point in taking chances.
``We have to take China very seriously,'' he said. Even in his 1964
manifesto, which is celebrated as a landmark in the Taiwan
independence movement, he never actually used the word
``independence,'' he said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can wait,'' he said. And anyway, he said, ``how could a
country have a free election for a president, as we just did, and
still be considered part of Communist China?''

   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for
used cars. &QL;

<P>
   It's definitely Science Lite, but the April issue includes a
couple of interesting pieces. The cover story details the discovery
of ancient Roman ships near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the
Tuscany region of Italy. Researchers have found the remnants of at
least 17 ships dating from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 and yielding
a number of artifacts, including incense burners, oil lamps, fish
hooks, sewing needles and numerous amphorae _ large earthen jars
used to transport goods around the Mediterranean. There's also an
interesting story on the world's ``deadliest carnivore'' a
half-mongoose, half-cloud leopard called a fossa, which lives in
Madagascar and apparently spends much of its food budget on Lemur
Helper. Our intrepid explorers actually manage to catch one of
these slick dudes, and then pass the tranquilized cat around for
polaroids. Way to be ecosensitive, dude.

 &UR; ``GOLF'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong message emanating from this magazine, and that
message is: ``We want to sell you some really expensive golf
clubs!'' Or a luxury car. Or both. Still, this issue includes some
interesting features, including an 18-hole ``course'' on everything
from repairing divots to teaching your kids to play. Of course,
like most articles in the magazine, some of these helpful hints
double as ads _ many of the ``solutions'' involve buying cool stuff
or going to a ritzy resort. If you really want to ruin your swing,
consult some of the technical-sounding instructions in the back,
with lines like ``the upper spine is farther from the target than
the lower spine.'' Uh huh. And the ball is rolling through the
desert. There is also a fun feature that names the nation's 10 best
public courses. Arizona made the list, with Apache Stronghold in
San Carlos. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE NEW YORKER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Includes one of those great articles that keep you coming back
for more _ a feature story on the top writer for ``The Simpsons,''
a former ``Harvard Lampoon'' staffer named George Meyer. It is
Meyer who writes many of the lines that are quoted from the wildly
successful series. Even his fellow writers stand pretty much in awe
of him. ``I would rather make George Meyer laugh than win an
Emmy,'' a colleague notes. Meyer, who traces his comedic roots back
to ``Mad'' magazine, culled his craft working for David Letterman
and Lorne Michaels. Writer David Owen does a nice job drawing Meyer
out, getting him to describe a less-than-idyllic childhood filled
with way too much television. There is also a well-done piece by
political correspondent Joe Klein which notes that John McCain
spent much more time adopting a posture of indignance than actually
explaining his positions. He says McCain plowed his jet into the
George W. Bush aircraft carrier, crippling both campaigns. &QL;

 &UR; WEBSITE REVIEW: www.yesterland.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are things that just work better on the Web.
Yesterland is one of them. With an astounding commitment to detail,
the site chronicles Disneyland attractions that have closed over
the years, complete with pictures and narrative histories.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about nostalgia. All those rides that you remember from
childhood are here: the campy Submarine Voyage (``helmsman, steer
clear of the teetering columns!''), the Old Matterhorn (pre-1978)
and the Skyway to Tomorrowland/Fantasyland
</P>
<P>
   (those old buckets that hang on the wire, closed in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   There is a piece on the old PeopleMover (presented by Goodyear,
closed in 1995), which pushed guests around with motors installed
in the track, taking them through Tomorrowland's indoor attractions
and above its outdoor attractions. And don't forget Rocket to the
Moon, a ``D'' ticket that later became Mission to Mars, until it
closed in 1992. Today, it's a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   How deep does this site go? It even includes a long feature on
the old parking lot, which has been closed to make way for a new
slate of rides and other attractions. The article notes that those
who arrived early could park in the ``convenient Bambi section,''
but those who came late ``could be way back in Thumper or Winnie
the Pooh.'' &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TRUE NORTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Kimberly Kafka (Dutton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of Kafka's first novel is Bailey Lockhart, a
35-year-old woman who has fled a troubled past to find solace as a
medic and bush pilot in the remote wilderness of Alaska. She lives
alone in a cabin 80 miles upriver from the nearest community, a
Native village with which she stays in touch by radio. The book
opens when she agrees to fly two tourists _ they claim to be
looking for a ``wilderness adventure'' but are really searching
illegally for Alaskan gold _ from Anchorage to a deserted lodge
five miles upriver from her camp. Add to this the romantic
attentions of Kash, a Native leader and realistic man who is trying
to look after the interests of his people, as well as the despair
and animosity felt toward Whites by many residents in the village,
and you have a pretty interesting look at major issues in Alaska
today. The plot lags a bit during the characters' seemingly endless
travels up and down the river, but Kash is appealing, Bailey is
strong and utterly capable, and their wilderness lives make for
good reading. Kafka, who is a wilderness emergency medical
technician, lives in Alaska and Wisconsin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PENGUIN BOOK OF IRISH FICTION'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Colm Toibin (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toibin begins this anthology with a challenge: ``If you want to
read about the vagaries of the human heart,'' he says, ``or the
fleeting nature of love or time, read Goethe's lyrics; but if you
want to know about the unreliable nature of narrative in a time of
landlords, read Maria Edgeworth. If you want to know how love can
lead to marriage, read Jane Austen; but if you want to delve into
the secret and dark unconscious of an embattled ruling class, read
Bram Stoker, Charles Maturin and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.'' Such is
Irish fiction, a territory in which, to paraphrase Maria Edgeworth,
reality is too strong, passion too violent, the world too feverish
to look upon without the disguising balm of language. Toibin has
assembled fiction from the time of Jonathan Swift to that of Emma
Donoghue, who was born a mere 31 years ago. Included are broad
selections from James Joyce, as well as excerpts from Roddy Doyle's
``The Snapper,'' Edna O'Brien's ``The Country Girls,'' Oscar
Wilde's ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' John Banville's ``The Book
of Evidence,'' Iris Murdoch's ``The Red and the Green'' and many
others.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By David Liss (Random House, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Weaver is a man who performs work of a ``delicate
nature'' on behalf of rich and illustrious men, clients who are
driven to insult him but whose barbs Weaver shrugs off ``as a bear
tosses off the dogs sent to bait it in Hockley-in-the-Hole.''
Weaver is the consummate outsider: He is a former boxer who now
works as a private investigator, of sorts; a brainy, brawling
thug-for-hire. He is also a Jew, which distances him further from
the men he serves. More important, he is the tremendously appealing
narrator of this first novel, one of the best to come along in
years. Set in 18th-century London, ``Conspiracy'' takes Weaver into
a complex case that begins when he learns that the seemingly
accidental death of his father, a stock-jobber to whom Weaver had
not spoken in 10 years, was really a murder. Weaver's work becomes
personal then, and he throws himself into an investigation that
goes deep into the world of British finance and into the dark
territory of the city's criminal elite. It's great entertainment,
which Liss serves up with intelligence, historical accuracy and
rip-roaring ambition. Enjoy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``JANE GOODALL: 40 YEARS AT GOMBE'' &QL; 
 &UR; (ST&AMP;C, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had a conversation recently with a man of a certain age, who
told us that the consensus among men of his generation is that Jane
Goodall was, as he put it, ``a babe.'' We confess we had never
heard that word applied to Goodall (and we imagine that she would
be amused to know of it), but we were reminded of the sentiment as
we looked at the early photographs in this book. They are personal
memories for so many people, these images of a barefoot, slender
young woman in shorts, long hair tied back, her attention given
over wholly to the intelligent animals that she would study all her
life. Her first article on the chimpanzees of the Gombe Stream Game
Reserve in Tanzania appeared in ``National Geographic''in 1963, and
it was not long before everyone knew who Goodall was. Today, she is
66 and travels constantly on a public relations mission to preserve
and enhance the lives of the creatures she came to love. This book
is a reminder of what a great combination youth, daring and
commitment can be. And he's right: She was something to see.  &QL;

   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   `Titus,' Emperor Of Mondays  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been a much better year to start up a dot-com than a
sitcom _ unless you're the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time since the start of 2000, Fox has brought on
a new comedy to near-spectacular ratings, with the debut of
``Titus'' on Fox on Monday night proving to be the most popular
thing on the network since Darva met Rick and thought she was
marrying a rich guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' pulled in more than 14 million viewers, scoring the
highest rating for any show premiere on a Monday night in the
network's history. That success comes on the heels of the showing
for ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which moved to Sunday nights in
January and immediately established itself as the first comedy to
reach hit status this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' is not all the way there yet, because it has to prove
that the viewers who tried it once will come back a second time.
But as Sandy Grushow, the chairman of Fox Entertainment put it,
``You'd certainly rather get out of the blocks like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the key to success was finding the right week to
introduce ``Titus,'' which mainly meant avoiding a week when ABC
would use ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on Monday. But
``Titus'' was especially well scheduled, going against a weak movie
about Playboy bunnies on ABC, the ratings-challenged ``Freaks and
Geeks'' on NBC and the loudly flopping ``Grapevine'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' was able to join ``Malcolm in the Middle'' as the only
new comedy on any network this season to even give a hint that it
might be a hit. Almost no other comedy anywhere else has made much
of an impression this season, with NBC suffering an especially long
drought in trying to find something to work with its hit comedies
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is trying two new entries this Thursday, a family sitcom
called ``Daddio'' and a police comedy called ``Battery Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' and ``Malcolm'' are also the only two comedies this
season to expand on the audience of the established comedy leading
into it. For ``Titus'' that was ``That '70s Show,'' which has grown
into a solid performer for Fox at 8 p.m. on Mondays. ``Titus''
improved on the lead-in for that series by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One thing ``Titus'' has in common with ``Malcolm'' is that both
are based on the personal experiences of their creators. But in the
case of ``Titus'' the personal experiences of the star, Christopher
Titus, are considerably more grim than the largely goofy family
experiences being explored by Linwood Bloomer, the creator and
producer of ``Malcolm.''
</P>
<P>
   For Grushow, success for ``Titus'' would be especially valuable
in what has mainly been a struggling year for the network. ``If we
can count on this as another piece of the puzzle, we have a lot
more flexibility in building our schedule for next season,''
Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Carter
</P>
<P>
   `Realm' Reincarnated
</P>
<P>
   Five months after it was canceled by Fox, Chris Carter's ``Harsh
Realm'' will return to television Friday night on the FX cable
network. That must represent sweet vindication for Carter, creator
of Fox's very successful ``X-Files.'' Though the ``Harsh Realm''
debut on Oct. 8 was watched by 7.5 million viewers, only 3.7
million tuned in to watch its third episode.
</P>
<P>
   The show, starring Scott Bairstow and D.B. Sweeney, was canceled
days later. At the time, Carter had fully completed 9 shows of a
13-show order.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation was rather abrupt for Carter, whose ``X-Files''
is often credited with helping make the Fox network prominent. He
made his displeasure public, attributing the series' rocky start to
poor promotion by Fox. ``I think they have big problems, and we
were part of a bigger effort to clean house,'' Carter was quoted in
The Hollywood Reporter as saying at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he said: ``I was excited about the show. I think the
stars were great and I know, because I've seen the nine episodes,
it deserved a shot and it could have held its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter further needled Fox in February by inserting a little of
``Harsh Realm'' into an ``X-Files'' episode. (A man whose daughter
is being abducted from her bedroom is shown watching ``Harsh
Realm'' in his living room and muttering to himself, ``This is
great!'')
</P>
<P>
   The ever-expanding cable dial is allowing ``Harsh Realm'' to
live on after its network death. FX, Fox TV's sister network in 45
million homes, will run the show every Friday for the next nine
weeks. The first three episodes will be the same first three that
ran on the Fox broadcast network. The next sixwill begin April 14.
</P>
<P>
   FX executives said they expect the show to fit nicely within
their programming schedule, which is built partly around reruns of
Carter's ``X-Files'' and ``Millennium,'' said a network spokesman,
John Solberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a degree it's original programming for us,'' Solberg said.
``While three episodes aired on Fox, we've got six hours of
never-before-seen product from one of the premier producers of
television there is in Chris Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he was pleased, too. ``It's just a nice opportunity
to take what I think is good, hard work _ stress the `good' _ and
let it be seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, of course, has other things to worry about, like whether
his ``X-Files'' will live for another season on Fox. He said
negotiations were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice because I'm writing episode 20 right now of
22,'' he said. ``If we're going to wrap this series up, I feel that
it would be best to do it with foreknowledge of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``X-Files'' doesn't survive after this year, Carter will have
another shot at the Fox broadcast schedule with his pilot ``The
Lone Gunmen,'' which centers on three peripheral ``X-Files''
characters. It has been mentioned as a possible replacement of
``X-Files.'' But then, so was ``Harsh Realm.''

   Who Wants to Be ...
</P>
<P>
   To take full advantage of its association with the Oscar special
Sunday night, ABC is adding a special edition of ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' on Friday night at 8: a show devoted to questions
about movies.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a stand-alone; the contestants from the regular
editions of the show will not carry over to this one. Every
contestant on Friday's show, which was taped last week, qualified
by answering only movie questions.
</P>
<P>
   One more note about the worldwide phenomenon of ``Millionaire,''
which is now on the air in more than 70 countries: four of the
candidates running for president in Russia turned up as contestants
in the Russian edition of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, who did not include the current Russian leader,
Vladimir Putin, who happened to be meeting with Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain at the time, were on the show to help raise their
profiles.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a hit in Russia as well (of course) drawing about 30
million viewers.

   Those Frequent Fliers
</P>
<P>
   With Pope John Paul II in Israel, President Clinton in India and
the Russian elections approaching, the network news anchors are
building up their frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Dan Rather flew to Russia on Thursday, returned to New
York on Sunday, and headed to Washington on Monday morning to
interview John McCain for ``60 Minutes II,'' only to return to New
York later that day for Monday night's edition of ``Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 P.M. Monday he boarded a plane for Tel Aviv. He may head
to Russia later in the week, a CBS spokeswoman said. Peter Jennings
arrived in New Delhi on Sunday night, the only anchor to go there
for President Clinton's visit. He was to depart Tuesday night for
Jerusalem, where he is to stay through Saturday before leaving for
Clinton's meeting with the Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, in Geneva on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Tyndall, publisher of The Tyndall Report, which monitors
network television news, said this was the most traveling that the
Big Three news anchors had done since the summer of 1997, when both
Mother Teresa and Diana, Princess of Wales, died.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Jennings was expected to arrive home in New York
on Monday night (Ted Koppel will be covering the Russian elections
for ABC from Moscow, where he has been since Thursday.) Tom Brokaw
of NBC flew to Israel on Monday. He was planning to stay there
through Thursday before heading to Moscow to cover the elections,
which start on Friday. It is unclear when he will return.

WORLD'S MOST PROMINENT INTERFAITH COUPLE TO GREET POPE
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: This subs for budgeted POPE-JORDAN) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When Pope John Paul II celebrates Mass in Bethlehem
on Wednesday, one of the world's most prominent interfaith couples,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his wife, Suha, will be among
those greeting him.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Arafat, a Muslim, and Suha, a Greek Orthodox
Christian, at a Mass in Manger Square near the site traditionally
recognized as Jesus' birthplace reflects the mix of faiths that the
pope will encounter during his historic Holy Land pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The Arafats will greet John Paul when he arrives by helicopter
in Bethlehem and present him mother of pearl depictions of the 14
stations of the cross, the traditional scenes of Jesus' march to
his crucifixion, one of Arafat's chief advisers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the pope as a great Christian leader who is seeking
peace,'' adviser Ibrahim Kandalaft said.
</P>
<P>
   Kandalaft, a Greek Orthodox Christian, said Arafat and his wife
attended three Christmas Masses for three different denominations
last year: Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Chrof.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Arafat) respects Christianity,'' said Kandalaft, whose
family was among Palestinian Christians uprooted from their homes
in the 1967 war when Israel took over both east and west Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Christian groups invited to the Mass are Greek
Orthodox, Latin Catholic, Armenian, Syrian Orthodox, Syrian
Catholic, Ethiopian Orthodox, marionite and Coptic, Kandalaft said.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures quoted in The Jerusalem Post this week
identify 130,000 Christians in Israel, about 2.1 percent of the
population. About 50,000 more live in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, 143,000 Christians lived in Israel and the surrounding
territories, representing 7 percent of the population. Since the
Israeli victory in the 1967 war, the percentage of Christians has
declined in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is the subject of an ongoing debate. A position paper
by the Anti-Defamation League blames the growing Muslim population,
in part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of reprisal has led Christians to be silent about Islamic
extremist harassment, destruction of property and, in some
instances, physical attacks,'' the league said.
</P>
<P>
   Kandalaft, on the other hand, blames ``atrocities of the Israeli
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side blames the Christian departure on any single
factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League paper acknowledges that the 1967 war
contributed to the emigration of Christians. And Kandalaft said
social and economic factors have also prompted many Christians to
move to other countries, particularly the United States _ where
they believe they can make a better living _ Australia, Canada and
Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, religious leaders in Jordan, the first stop on the
pope's visit, reported the pullout of Christians for various
economic and social reasons. Despite government policies for equal
treatment, some Christians believe they are discriminated against
in the workplace and seek better conditions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ancient Christian community is ever-present, and
Christian pilgrims from throughout the world flood holy sites in
Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival in Jerusalem yesterday, John Paul called for
dialogue among Muslims, Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He received a warm welcome, even from Christians whose
denominations don't recognize him as their official leader.
</P>
<P>
   Issa Odes, 62, a shop owner in the Christian quarter of the Old
City of Jerusalem, said he is delighted that John Paul is coming to
the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man. He's an old man,'' said Odes, a Greek
Orthodox Christian. ``He doesn't hurt anybody. He talks well. We
respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Abuald, a Latin Catholic shopkeeper, concurs with others,
hoping that the pope's attempt to promote harmony bears fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Christians are not unhappy in Jerusalem, even if we are a
minority,'' Abuald said. ``But we will be happier if there is peace
between Israel and the Palestinians.''

MARKET PLACE: INVESTORS SEE RATE HIKE AS NECESSARY MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FED-RATES and MARKET) 
(bl) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The no-surprises Federal Reserve Board gave investors just what
they were expecting Tuesday: a one-quarter point increase in
short-term interest rates. The full-of-surprises stock market
delivered a smashing gain on the news, with two of the broadest
indexes closing at new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the midafternoon announcement that the Fed had pushed the
federal funds rate to 6 percent, stocks had been adrift. After the
news, they took off, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index
rising 2.56 percent to end the day at a record of 1,493.87. The
Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the entire stock market and
is reportedly monitored by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, closed at a
high of 14,345.88, up 2 percent on the day. The Nasdaq rose 2.21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists said the market's reaction reflected two things.
First, investors were relieved that the Fed had not chosen to be
more aggressive and raise rates by one-half point. In addition,
investors seemed to greet the one-quarter point rise as medicine
the Fed must administer to keep the long economic expansion
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is rate hikes are bad for the stock
market,'' said Jay Mueller, economics strategist at Strong Capital
Management in Milwaukee. ``But I think the market recognizes that
good monetary policy means you sometimes have to raise rates. The
Fed had to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, given that the Fed is almost as concerned about
excessive speculation in the stock market today as it is about a
resurgence in inflation, the blistering moves in stocks probably
disappointed Greenspan. The gains also indicate, to some, that the
central bank is a spectator rather than an actor in the drama
playing out in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed's just not in control,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The economy is surging
at a rate that is clearly excessive, and while there's been some
rather frenetic rotation in the stock market, wealth creation is
still open-ended. The Fed, in my view, is staying incremental with
a very blunt instrument, the fed funds rate, that is inappropriate
for dealing with the problems that it's facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tools available to the Fed that might cool things down
include raising the initial amount of money that investors must put
up to buy stocks on borrowed money _ known as the margin
requirement _ or increasing the amount of reserves that banks must
have on hand as a percent of their deposits. A higher reserve
requirement means less money will be available for loans, which
would slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Even as stock investors celebrated the Fed's vigilance against
inflation, their enthusiasm made it more likely that the central
bank will push through additional rate increases this year. Rising
stock prices, said William Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman
Sachs, make it harder for monetary policy to bring the economy back
down to earth. ``The financial markets are not doing a lot of
tightening for the Fed,'' Dudley said. ``The logical conclusion is
that the Fed will have to do more than people anticipate.''
Currently, the Wall Street consensus is that the Fed will raise
rates another one-half point and be done with it, a view Dudley
considers too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most investors applaud Greenspan's incremental moves
even in the face of a rapidly growing economy. Stefan D. Abrams,
chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust Co. of the
West, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation of why the Fed is moving so gingerly with
these quarter-point moves is that either they see the signs of a
slowdown already evident in the shape of the yield curve, the price
of oil, the leveling of single-family housing starts, or they
believe that the lag is long between the beginning of a monetary
tightening and its showing up in the real economy. Greenspan thinks
he's on a glide path here to a soft landing and he doesn't need to
take more aggressive steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest beneficiaries of Tuesday's move were some of
the old investor favorites: General Electric rose $10.50 to
$151.4375 and Microsoft advanced $5.375 to $102.75. Even bank
stocks rallied, which is not normally the case when rates rise
because such increases are a drag on profits. The Philadelphia Bank
stock index rose 4.4 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bond market reacted favorably to the rate increase.
Prices rose across the board, pushing down yields on the 30-year
bond to 5.97 percent from 6 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks continued to decline Tuesday with the American
Stock Exchange biotech index falling 2.3 percent. It is down more
than 35 percent from its peak of two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's big move in stocks did not surprise Dudley, who
pointed out that historically, Fed tightening episodes have not
been all bad for equities. ``On average, since the 1960s, the stock
market has gone up when the Fed tightens because the Fed usually
tightens when the economy is strong,'' he said. ``What ends up
stopping bull markets is inflation because that causes the Fed to
shift to a truly hostile stance. Stock markets fear inflation, not
Fed tightening per se.''

 &HT;    AOL becomes latest to offer local content to wireless devices
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you want local information online, you no longer
need a computer to do it.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the Microsoft Network and AccessAtlanta all have
``Internet everywhere'' products that will deliver local news,
sports and entertainment to almost any electronic device you can
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The newest entry into the wireless fray is AOL's Digital City.
AOL announced a nationwide rollout Tuesday of what it called
Digital City 2000. The service will be available in 200 markets
nationwide _ up from 60 _ and will also be accessible via wireless
hand-held devices as part of an initiative called ``Local
Everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest entry into a market analysts say is exploding.
Local information provided in many forms will be a lucrative niche
for ``city sites'' that put information at consumers' fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been predicting for years that the online market
for local goods and services would eventually explode and bring in
millions in advertising from local retailers and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications predicts that by 2002, 54 percent of the
$7.7 billion spent on online advertising will be spent locally,
making local content one of the fastest-growing online categories.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Leonsis, president of AOL Interactive Properties, said in an
interview Tuesday that total availability in every U.S. market on a
variety of electronic devices is the goal of Digital City 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it represented an evolution from previous
incarnations of Digital City and its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as AOL developed from a community-based business to a
media business to a part of your daily life, Digital City is
evolving the same way. It's convenience in a box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Digital City will offer local entertainment, dining, resource
guides and directory services provided in conjunction with 200
content partners such as MoviePhone, MapQuest and Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   No huge advertising blitz is planned. Digital City hopes word of
mouth will bring users to its sites.
</P>
<P>
   In many major markets, several players are vying to gain the
most users. New entrants, like Digital City, face
already-established Web sites with dedicated content developers,
designers and programmers, as well as partnerships with local media
outlets. For example, Boston has the vast resources of The Boston
Globe and media partners across the city to make Boston.com one of
the largest and most popular local sites in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Digital City faces AccessAtlanta, the top-rated city
site in the country. According to Media Metrix's fourth-quarter
report, AccessAtlanta ranked 11th in the Atlanta market, ahead of
such nationally known sites as Excite, eBay and ZDNet. In Atlanta,
Digital City ranked 48th on the list of 100 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake to say we don't worry about Digital
City,'' says AccessAtlanta General Manager George deGolian. ``We
look at them every single day. We are always working to make sure
we are strongly differentiated from them and serving that local
market as best as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta and Digital City will also compete with a new
offering from the Microsoft Network called MSN Mobile, which
delivers a selection of MSN services including news, stocks, travel
and Web browsing on cellular phones and pagers. MSN's wireless
service does not offer local content, having sold its ``Sidewalk''
service to Ticketmaster/CitySearch in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Like Digital City and the Microsoft Network, AccessAtlanta has
its own wireless service called ``AccessAtlanta Everywhere,''
available on cellular phones, pagers and personal digital
assistants. Marketing manager Rhonda McClendon says the service has
been up in Atlanta for two weeks and is free to users with
Web-enabled electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are roughly 3,500 users of AccessAtlanta Anywhere.
About 2,900 have signed up for e-mail alerts in categories that
interest them. Areas currently offered include local news, sports,
weather, traffic, entertainment calendars, movie times and severe
weather alerts.
</P>
<P>
   According to deGolian, AccessAtlanta's offering, unlike some
wireless services, can be customized to suit the needs, interests
or even different devices users might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool thing you can do with it is customize to have e-mail
updates, traffic reports or other information whenever you want.
It's also possible for users of multiple appliances to have one
type of information sent to a pager and another to a cell phone,
even if you have devices from several providers,'' deGolian said.
``It's a broader strategy that ties into our content strategy of
broad distribution of locally focused content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at things that were most useful to people on the
go,'' deGolian said. ``By definition, if you are wireless that
means you are not locked to your computer. If you are in your car,
traffic and weather updates make sense, movies make sense. You want
to check movie showtimes.''
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta is hoping users who have made its Web site so
successful will also take advantage of the company's local wireless
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Whiteside, chief operating officer of Cox Interactive
Media, which operates AccessAtlanta, says the combination of
localized content and national content like search, chat and
shopping has propelled CIM's 26 city sites ahead of their
competition. (Cox Interactive Media is a subsidiary of Cox
Enterprises, parent company of The Atlanta Journal Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   He also credits the success to having staffers in each city
working on each site.
</P>

COLONIAL AIMS AT GOLDEN BEAR FOR SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger trackers, for a third consecutive year, will be shut out
at the MasterCard Colonial. But those who venture to Fort Worth,
Texas, might find even more exotic game roaming between the gallery
ropes, if circumstances unfold kindly for the guys in plaid jackets
during the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we suggest it: Golden Bear cleat marks at Colonial? For the
first time since 1983?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's far from a given. And, in a best-case scenario, we're
probably talking about Jack Nicklaus playing in a Tuesday shootout
rather than the actual tournament. But the possibility exists,
thanks to the presence of Nicklaus' son, Gary, as a rookie on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 60, has expressed a desire to attend as many events as
possible in which Gary competes this season. Gary Nicklaus, the No.
139 player on this week's money list ($46,020), can secure a spot
in the Colonial field by climbing into the Top 80 money winners by
May 7 or by receiving an exemption from tournament officials.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Gary lands an invitation for the May 18-21 event in
Fort Worth. His father, as the 1982 Colonial champ, has a lifetime
exemption into the field and a standing invitation to take part in
the pretournament champions' dinner.
</P>
<P>
   With Jack's own event, the Memorial Tournament, looming one week
after Colonial on the PGA Tour calendar, no one on the tournament
committee expects the elder Nicklaus to exercise his option to
compete at ``Hogan's Alley.'' But a trip to the champion's dinner
would not be out of the question. And, if that happens, why not a
spot in Tuesday's shootout?
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, that might be the best possible thing we could
hope for,'' said Phil Thomas, Colonial tournament chairman. ``If we
could get Jack down here to play in a shootout, what more could you
ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas confirmed that discussions are ongoing about ways to
incorporate Senior Tour players into the Colonial shootout but said
it would be premature to characterize any fresh twists as final.
But the possibilities seem limitless.
</P>
<P>
   What about a shootout filled with father-son tandems, with the
Nicklaus duo taking on the possible pairings of Bob Duval-David
Duval, Al Geiberger-Brent Geiberger and Dave Stockton-Dave
Stockton, Jr. in a best-ball competition? What about a little
five-on-five contest, with Senior Tour rookie Tom Kite _ already a
Colonial commitment _ joining the four elder statesmen mentioned
above against five flat bellies from the PGA Tour in a team event?
What about grouping players in a four-team competition, with sides
based on birthday decades (Guys born in the 1940s play together,
guys born in the '50s play together, and so forth)?
</P>
<P>
   Without question, there is precedent for mixing Senior Tour and
PGA Tour players in an exhibition format. A few years back, the
Houston Open held a Tuesday long-drive contest between John Daly
and Jim Dent, the longest hitters on the two tours. It drew more
than 10,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus' presence at Colonial, no doubt, would spin the
turnstiles on an otherwise quiet Tuesday during tournament week.
With Tiger Woods headed to Germany that week to defend a European
Tour title, it would create some pretournament buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Golden Bear's expanded playing schedule in 2000, a
Colonial cameo might not be that far-fetched. Nicklaus plans to
play in all four major championships on both tours. He said Gary's
weekly presence at PGA Tour events ``renewed my interest in playing
a few more times on the regular tour. I want to be part of what
he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials stressed that Gary Nicklaus would not be
given an exemption ahead of a more deserving player simply to
enhance the opportunity to entice his father to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be a bordering situation ... where we'd say,
`We'll do this, Jack, if you'll do that,' '' Thomas said. ``If Gary
earns his way in, we'd love to have them both. If something comes
up with Gary, we'd certainly go after Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   TIGER'S LATEST WEAPON: KNOCKDOWN, 9-IRON SHOT HELPING WOODS THIS
SEASON
</P>
<P>
   A two-week break from the PGA Tour rigors could not cool Tiger
Woods' hot streak. With Sunday's victory at the Bay Hill
Invitational, Woods has won seven of his past 10 starts at tour
events. He has finished second on two other occasions. Woods,
preparing for The Players Championship that begins Thursday, said
much of the credit for his fast start to the 2000 season can be
traced to a shot he perfected during the off-season: a knockdown,
9-iron that allows him to limit the spin on approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   The shot is especially effective on California courses, where
players usually find soft greens covered with poa-annua grass in
January and February. Such a combination tends to make wedge shots
spin back farther than normal after impact. Hence, the need for the
knockdown 9-iron. Woods leaned on the shot heavily during the
``West Coast Swing,'' when he won twice and finished second once
while becoming the first golfer in 52 years to record victories in
six consecutive tour starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate for me, right there, to be able to hit
that shot,'' Woods said. ``At times, I've surprised myself ...
because I'd never been able to hit it in competition before. That's
something I'm very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   HAAS SEEKS AGENT
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Haas, the nation's No. 1-ranked amateur golfer, has begun
interviewing agents in preparation for turning professional this
season. A recent session with agent Jim Lehman, brother of PGA Tour
player Tom Lehman, led to Haas setting up a Monday practice round
during Masters week with Tom Lehman, Larry Mize and Tim Herron.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, a 23-year-old from Fort Worth, also has held discussions
with International Management Group, whose clients include Tiger
Woods, Arnold Palmer and David Duval. Haas plans to join Palmer for
a Tuesday practice round at Augusta National Golf Club, where the
Southwest High School graduate is scheduled to make his Masters
debut April 6-9. Haas is in the Masters field because of his
victory at the 1999 U.S. Public Links Championship. SUPPORTING
SOLHEIM
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, PGA Tour officials were embroiled in a bitter
lawsuit with Karsten Solheim, creator of Ping golf clubs, for
bringing square-grooved irons to professional golf events. Now,
they're pushing for his inclusion in the World Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Finchem, PGA Tour commissioner, said his organization
supports the stance of LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw, who is urging
Hall of Fame voters to induct Solheim in its 2001 class for
lifetime achievement. Tour officials dropped their legal challenge
to Ping clubs in 1993 and mended fences with Solheim under the
direction of Finchem, who became commissioner on June 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Solheim, who died in February at age 88, was a longtime sponsor
of multiple LPGA events. In 1990, he created the Solheim Cup, the
women's equivalent of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Finchem and I both believe that Karsten is most deserving
of induction,'' Votaw said. ``Both of our organizations are in
complete support of his candidacy.'' PEERS PICK KANE
</P>
<P>
   Lorie Kane, a fifth-year participant on the LPGA Tour, has been
selected as the 2000 winner of The William and Mousie Powell Award.
Given annually by fellow players, the award recognizes the LPGA
player who, in the opinion of her playing peers, ``best exemplifies
the spirit, ideals and values of the LPGA'' through her behavior
and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, 35, will become the 15th recipient of the Powell Award on
Thursday at The Nabisco Championship in Rancho Mirage, Calif. A
winner of more than $1.8 million since joining the tour in 1996,
Kane has nine second-place finishes but still seeks her first
career LPGA victory. RECRUITING TRIP
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials from both the MasterCard Colonial and GTE
Byron Nelson Classic have been evident during practice rounds this
week at The Players Championship, trying to secure commitments for
their events. The Colonial contingent includes tournament chairman
Phil Thomas, club president Steve Sykes, past club president Clark
Martin and former tournament chairman Floyd Wade. Byron Nelson, the
tournament's namesake, is among the glad-handers for the Nelson
event.
LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   ``To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th anniversary, the
\Star-Telegram'' will feature a significant moment in tour history
each week during the 2000 season.'' OCT. 13, 1963
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Wright carved out an indelible spot in history, in more
ways than one, by holding off Louise Suggs, Mary Lena Faulk and
Mary Mills to win the LPGA Championship at Stardust Country Club in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Wright's 13th of the season, a tour record. It
also was her fourth title at the LPGA Championship, the most by any
player. In 37 years, neither mark has been eclipsed by subsequent
LPGA tourists.
TIPS FROM THE PROS
</P>
<P>
   ``During the golf season, the ''Star-Telegram'' will feature
occasional tips from professional golf instructors based in Tarrant
County. Today's tip is from Dana Bellenger, director of instruction
at the Academy at Water Chase in Fort Worth. Bellenger also tutors
players on the PGA and Buy.com tours.'' CHIPPING FROM THIN LIES
</P>
<P>
   With the spring growing season not yet in full swing, local
fairways have more bare patches than normal. That creates extra
challenges when chipping. But you can stick it close to the hole
just as easily off bare ground as a lush lie if you remember two
simple tips: Keep your chest in front of the ball and keep your
legs still.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, you play a chip shot off your right toe. If you're
hitting off dirt or hardpan, be sure to put the ball farther back
in your stance to assure solid contact. The key alignment rule to
remember is ``Make sure the buttons on your shirt are in front of
the ball.'' The biggest problem people have with this shot is
failing to keep their chest in front of the ball so you can strike
with a descending blow.
</P>
<P>
   Get the proper alignment: ball behind your chest, heel of the
club slightly raised, grip off the left pocket. Then, keep your
lower body quiet and your wrists very firm. The tendency on a bad
lie is to try and help get the ball in the air by dipping your
knees or moving your legs to scoop the ball. You don't need to do
that. This is an arm and shoulders shot. There is no weight shift,
so body movement is not needed or desired.
</P>
<P>
   Once in position, take a short, firm swing and let the club do
the work. You'll find yourself saving strokes from the dirt. nn

ABC GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME IN PULLING `THEN CAME YOU' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dusty TV archives brim with stories of successful mid- and
late-season launches. ``The Simpsons'' premiered in January. So did
``All in the Family.'' NBC gave ``Dateline NBC'' a March send-off.
``Dallas'' was an April experiment that surpassed all expectations.
</P>
<P>
   So the producers of ``Then Came You,'' premiering Wednesday
night on ABC, have every reason to think that late is better than
never, no?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Came You'' is like every unspectacular sitcom you've ever
seen. Or never seen. And for it to catch on would be (a) a miracle,
(b) a travesty and (c) a sign that the apocalypse is near.
</P>
<P>
   Originally penciled in as one of the network's entries last
fall, ``Then Came You'' was pulled at the last minute because (a)
it isn't very good, (b) it isn't very original, and (c) ABC
realized it in time. Putting it on in March isn't so much a sign of
confidence as it is a sign of diffidence.
</P>
<P>
   The premise _ yet another revisitation of the mismatched-lovers
theme from ``Romeo and Juliet'' _ already gets plenty of attention
on the ABC comedies ``Dharma and Greg'' and ``Spin City,'' so to
merit a second look ``Then Came You'' would have to be pretty darn
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It's not. It is exceedingly mediocre, borrowing from so many
comedies that have gone before that it could be the poster child
for this season's popular refrain: What's wrong with the
traditional sitcom?
</P>
<P>
   Susan Floyd plays a well-heeled divorced woman in her 30s who
falls in love with a hotel waiter 10 years her junior, played by
Thomas Newton. Both have sidekicks, re-creating the ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' vibe without the gay overtones or the hilarious
scene-stealing of Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes. Her sidekick
(Miriam Shor) seems to be doing her best impression of Jennifer
Aniston's Rachel from ``Friends.'' His (Desmond Askew) is
``Seinfeld's'' Kramer with an English accent.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the series is based on the experiences of one of the
show's creators, Betsy Thomas, who actually got divorced in her 30s
and fell in love with a young room-service waiter when she was
living in a Los Angeles hotel after moving out of her house.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being rooted in fact, ``Then Came You'' seems
more to be relying on the fiction that viewers will swallow
anything that's delivered with a laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   `Freaks and Geeks' canceled
</P>
<P>
   If you saw Monday's episode of ``Freaks and Geeks,'' the one
where Lindsay (Linda Cardellini) tries pot and Bill (Martin Starr)
almost dies from eating peanuts, cherish it. It's the last episode
that will air on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The network informed the producers that the remaining episodes
of ``Freaks and Geeks'' will not air. They will be replaced by
editions of ``Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   On the production company's Web site, www.freaksandgeeks.com,
executive producer Judd Apatow said: ``I'm afraid to say the end
has come. NBC is dropping the show immediately and replacing it
with `Dateline.' They have agreed to allow another network to run
the last six episodes, and possibly the second season, if someone
is interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a late-season pickup is indeed unlikely, but co-executive
producer Paul Feig said discussions are taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Widely praised for its accurate depiction of high school life in
1980, ``Freaks and Geeks'' never attracted a large audience. Of
course, NBC never kept it on the air longer than four weeks at a
time. After debuting on Saturday nights last fall, the show moved
in January to Mondays at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great hopes for Monday,'' Feig said, ``but we never
really got the promotion we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Came You. Half-hour comedy about a woman who falls in love
with a man 10 years younger than she. Starring Susan Floyd, Thomas
Newtown, Miriam Shor and Desmond Askew. Series premiere Wednesday
night on ABC. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

COMMENTARY: NATURAL BORN KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Here's a quiz: Two sectors of the global food industry
grew rapidly in the late 1990s. The products of one have been
extensively tested, without any evidence of harm. Those of the
other are known to pose big health risks _ but nobody knows how
big, because lobbying by the industry has blocked effective
regulation, testing and even reporting. One of these sectors faces
passionate public opposition, which may soon drive it entirely out
of business, while the other basks in a warm glow of public
approval. (a) What sectors are we talking about? (b) Which sector
is in trouble?
</P>
<P>
   First, the answers to (a): One sector is the dietary supplement
business _ the people who sell you ephedra to lose weight,
melatonin to help you sleep, and so on. The other is the
genetically modified food business _ which attempts to add genes to
natural crops that confer resistance to pests, increased
nutritional value and other useful features.
</P>
<P>
   Now the answers to (b): There is extensive evidence that dietary
supplements can, if misused, be quite dangerous. A recent survey by
The Washington Post finds that ``increasing numbers of Americans
are falling seriously ill or even dying after taking dietary
supplements ... . The victims include men and women of all ages as
well as children ... .'' But a 1994 law specifically exempts
supplements from almost all federal regulation, including the need
to report adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
   You might expect activist pressure to change that law. But if
the bulletin boards at natural product stores near my home are any
indication, the people whom one might expect to campaign against an
industry that is reckless with people's health _ people who are
ready and willing to march against multinational corporations _ are
among the dietary supplement industry's most enthusiastic
customers. The products are ``natural,'' so they must be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is genetically modified, or GM, food, which has not
been shown to do any harm but arouses furious opposition,
especially in Europe. And this is one case in which Britain is
truly European: the local furor over GM food _ commonly referred to
here as ``Frankenfood'' _ would have done even the French proud.
All the public remembers is the story of the rats that got sick
after eating GM potatoes _ a case of misrepresented results,
supposed independent experts who were actually political activists,
and general media malfeasance. And opposition to GM products is
effectively killing the industry _ not just in Europe, but in
countries that export to Europe, which effectively means
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   GM food has not really caught fire as an issue in the United
States; but the sociology of the anti-GM movement here is utterly
familiar to anyone who tracks our own anti-globalization movement.
A report on the controversy by ``Equinox,'' a British equivalent to
the PBS news program ``Frontline,'' caught the picture perfectly:
comfortable middle- and upper-class activists talking reverently
about the virtues of traditional ways of life and the evils of
modern agricultural methods. (Yes, Prince Charles is an anti-GM
crusader.) A recurrent refrain was that we have managed without GM
for many centuries, so why change?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is that throughout those many centuries
the vast majority of people lived at the edge of starvation; only
very recently has a decent life become available to more than a
tiny elite. And that decent life is made possible by applied
science and technology _ including modern agriculture, which relies
crucially on chemicals that developing countries cannot afford.
Now, finally, genetic modification _ which can substitute for some
of the expensive chemicals used in the West _ offers a hope of
escape. And what is the response of the supposed friends of the
poor? The same as their response to the new opportunities for job-
and income-creating exports offered by growing global trade: horror
at the thought of change, romantic rhapsodizing about the virtues
of the traditional life.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the strange asymmetry between the treatment of dietary
supplements _ which often do real harm, but are ``natural'' _ and
GM foods, which can do enormous good, but are ``unnatural.'' Too
bad that the wretched of the earth will, as usual, pay the price
for the fantasies of the affluent.

ZUBOV SIGNS 5-YEAR, $25 MILLION DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Stars locked up their three-time
All-Star defenseman Sergei Zubov through the 2004-05 season
Tuesday, signing him to a five-year deal worth $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov, the only Stars player to play in all 73 games this
season, ranks second in the NHL in ice time among defensemen,
averaging 29 minutes, 10 seconds a game. His 41 points rank 12th
and his 32 assists tie him for 10th among defensemen in statistics
before last night's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really exciting for myself and my family. We've spent
four years over here; so far it's just a great time with the
team,'' Zubov said. ``I've been more concentrating on just playing
hockey, but it's great to get back with one of the best teams
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have all four of their top defensemen signed to
long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars acquired Zubov, 29, in a trade with Pittsburgh for
Kevin Hatcher on July 22, 1996. The Moscow native's career
blossomed after he came to Dallas. He was selected for his third
consecutive World All-Star team this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings his great skill with him, and his performance has
been so consistent,'' general manager Bob Gainey said. `` ... From
a personality point of view and just a balance, he's provided us
with a real element we needed.'' CARBONNEAU A GO?
</P>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau is working on finding a comfort zone with a soft
playing cast around his fractured right wrist. He was cautiously
optimistic Tuesday that he will play Friday against Chicago. Coach
Ken Hitchcock, who misses his checking center and penalty killer,
was more definitive on his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in, he's playing,'' Hitchcock said. ``Our opinion is he's
a practice player on Wednesday and Thursday and if he looks as good
as he did (Tuesday) then we'll move him up to be a player on
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau said his wrist feels sore, and he still has some
concerns about his effectiveness on faceoffs, wrist shots and
stickhandling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a lot of stuff out there,'' Carbonneau said. ``I can
hit the puck pretty hard. It's sore, but if I want to try a wrist
shot or stick handle a little bit then I have problems.'' THORNTON
REVIEW COMING
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gainey said he expects to have a conference call Wednesday
with winger Scott Thornton and NHL executive vice president and
director of hockey operations Colin Campbell to review Thornton's
hit Sunday on San Jose's Marco Sturm.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's hit was ruled a match penalty for attempting to
injure when he boarded Sturm and landed a forearm to his face.
Thornton's hit was in retaliation after Sturm wrestled him to the
ice moments earlier. A match penalty is automatically reviewed by
the league, which can levy a suspension. MARSHALL SAYS HE'S READY
</P>
<P>
   Winger Grant Marshall said his right groin is as good as it gets
for now, and he's ready to play again on Friday. Ken Hitchcock,
however, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to be evaluated, there's a difference,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a frustrating season for Marshall, who has played in
only 37 games because of two injured groins. This comes after his
breakout season last season, when he played in all 82 games and was
rewarded with a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get back,'' Marshall said. ``What's more
frustrating than anything is you want to play hard and honor that
contract, then you get hurt all year. That's very frustrating, but
I can't dwell on it.'' SLOAN SKATES, WON'T RUSH
</P>
<P>
   Winger Blake Sloan looked strong and agile Tuesday as he
returned to the ice to test his fractured ankle. His return to the
lineup is still likely a week or more away. He will wear the
red-cross jersey at Wednesday's practice, meaning he will
participate in all drills, but without any contact.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the
economy Tuesday, raising interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had
heard repeated hints over the last month from Alan Greenspan, the
central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of
raising rates in small, steady steps until he sees signs that the
supercharged economy is throttling back.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which some analysts consider Greenspan's main
target in raising rates, shrugged off the news and moved higher
after the Fed's announcement Tuesday afternoon. Apparently relieved
that the central bank did not raise rates by a half-point, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The
Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,711.68, up 101.68 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since June,
and it lifted the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight
loans between banks to 6 percent, its highest level in almost five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also raised its discount rate on loans to banks
from the Federal Reserve system by a quarter of a percentage point,
to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The moves put immediate upward pressure on rates paid by
consumers and businesses. Banks began raising their prime lending
rates by a quarter-point, to 9 percent, which will lead to slightly
higher rates on many home-equity and small-business loans as well
as credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision had a less direct effect on mortgage rates
and corporate borrowing costs, which are largely set in the bond
markets. Those rates have moved up over the last year as the Fed
has tightened monetary policy and are likely to continue doing so
as long as Greenspan remains on inflation alert. Yields on the
30-year government bond continued to fall, creating an unusual
situation in which the Fed's short-term rates were higher than the
market's longest-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee said it had raised rates again for the same reason it had
done so at its last meeting in February. It said, in effect, that
growth is running stronger than the economy can sustain over the
long run without creating inflationary bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee remains concerned that increases in demand will
continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee suggested that further rate increases are likely
if the economy does not slow substantially by the time it next
meets, on May 16. The committee, the statement said, ``believes the
risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate
heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence so far of any broad-based surge in
inflation outside of the sharp rise in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy has been growing at rates well beyond what most
economists think can be sustained over the long run without
generating inflation. The economy grew 6.9 percent in the last
quarter of 1999, and analysts think growth in the first three
months of this year could be about 5 percent. Consumer spending in
particular remains robust.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has traced the danger facing the economy to the stock
market. His argument _ which is being questioned on Wall Street and
in Washington _ is that the recent upturn in the growth rate of
productivity, or output per hour worked, is leading investors to
expect higher corporate profits and therefore to bid up stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Higher stock prices, in turn, are leaving investors feeling
wealthy and willing to spend, driving up demand for goods and
services. In Greenspan's view, demand is growing faster than the
economy can produce supply. The imbalance between demand and supply
has been contained so far through two safety valves: declining
unemployment, which is providing the workers needed to produce more
goods and services, and imports, which are filling the gap between
demand and what domestic companies can produce.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's point is that the safety valves cannot be counted on
much longer to absorb the strains being generated by strong demand
and that interest rates must rise until demand falls to a level
that the economy can meet.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has warned repeatedly that at its current pace, the
economy will soon run short of workers, putting upward pressure on
wages and ultimately prices. The unemployment rate in February was
4.1 percent, just a touch above its 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman has also warned that the nation is approaching
the limit of how much it can afford to import. His point was
underscored Tuesday by the release of monthly trade figures for
January, showing a deficit of $28 billion, another record and well
above what economists had projected.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has insisted that the goal of monetary policy is not
to drive stock prices down. But he has made clear that in his view
the pace of wealth generation stemming from the long run-up in
stock prices will have to be tempered if demand is to be restrained
_ a distinction that is lost on many analysts.

 UNDATED: many analysts.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of whether he is targeting the stock market is
a hot question,'' said Bill Cheney, an economist at John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance in Boston. ``It seems to me perfectly clear
that he is targeting it, and he merely has to deny pro forma that
he is doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he thought Greenspan is basically right that the
wealth being generated by the stock market is the source of much of
the excess demand in the economy. Other economists think that
Greenspan has it all wrong, or that he is focusing attention on the
stock market to avoid being criticized in an election year for
slowing the economy when there is no concrete evidence of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Fed were to literally threaten to raise the
unemployment rate and slow growth, it wouldn't be a great political
posture to take,'' said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin,
Kubik, Stephens &AMP; Thompson, an investment firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sharp disagreement among economists about how
much momentum the economy has, and how much further rates will have
to rise to erase any threat of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see some slower growth numbers pretty quickly,
good numbers on inflation and within three to six months you'll
start hearing talk about actual Fed easing,'' Wesbury said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts said the slowdown could still be a long way
off and that the Fed might have to raise rates sharply this spring
and summer to bring the economy under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus far, the core cost and price data have been so benign
that the Fed has been able to conduct a gradualist policy, hoping
to change behavior through a slow cash flow squeeze on companies
and individuals,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High
Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ``But if
inflation is beginning to accelerate, however slowly, Greenspan
will at least have to consider taking more drastic action.''  &QL;

   Who wants to be a millionaire? Almost every character in ``Romeo
Must Die,'' the first English-language starring vehicle for the
Hong Kong action star Jet Li. There's Isaak (Delroy Lindo), who is
waging an intimidation campaign against waterfront business owners
so he can buy up their properties, like that of Silk (DMX), whose
club may end up as the last standing opposition to Isaak's
ambition. Mac (Isaiah Washington), Isaak's bad-tempered right-hand
man, pushes around the people clinging to their shops and
businesses while dreaming of his own day in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's scrambling to get paid. There are only two honorable
people in the undercooked picture, Trish (Aaliyah), Isaak's
daughter, and Han (Li), a Hong Kong cop doing time in a Chinese
prison; he took a rap so that his brother and father could slip out
of the country. When word that his little brother has been killed
gets back to Han, he stages an escape so daring that even the
prison's guards are shaking their heads in disbelief, and he makes
his way to the United States to investigate his brother's death. He
kicks the story into gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo,'' which doesn't really include a Romeo and has only the
most fleeting reference to Shakespeare, is the first movie that
looks as if it was cast from the rap magazine The Source due to its
relatively chaste marriage of hip-hop and kung fu. In fact, there's
barely a shot in the movie that wouldn't make a great magazine
cover. The movie is overly dutiful in dragging itself through the
exercise of playing out its plot elements, ignoring the chief
lesson of its Hong Kong antecedents: extend the martial gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   If the Academy ever decides to give out Oscars for sheer
physical exertion, the other contenders will have to line up behind
Li. His mastery of the martial art known as wushu made Li a star
years ago to the fans of Hong Kong movies, with their exhilarating
blur of stunts and minimal-to-the-point-of-confusion story lines.
For the first half-hour or so, ``Romeo'' is very smart about giving
Li little dialogue since his command of English doesn't match his
grasp of hand-to-hand combat. Li is a comical presence because of
his Bruce-Lee-on-a-key-chain size. Even the willowy Aaliyah seems
to have a couple of inches on him, so his bouts with the SUV-size
thugs who snort vengefully into his hairline are jokey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo'' is a come-on, with cooing hip-hop songs popping up
whenever Aaliyah, who's a natural, glides across the screen. The
picture was conceived as a spotlight dance for Aaliyah and Li, but
they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting
out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Li's filmography
includes the revered ``Fist of Legend,'' a picture whose
awe-inspiring assemblage of flying feet and soaring fists was the
basis of the mano-a-mano choreography of ``The Matrix,'' and he's
much better when he bursts into hyperactivity than when batting
around coy badinage.
</P>
<P>
   When the action gets serious and a fatal blow is struck, there's
a cut to a computer-animated version of viscera taking the impact.
All in the name of good taste, of course. Unfortunately, it's
Western technology that gets in the way of Eastern thrill-seeking
workouts, and since Li does all of his own stunts, it's a peculiar
annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the snarling come-hither of Bruce Lee and his
imitators, Li's round face takes on a beatific serenity before he
goes to work on one of his Cinemascope beatdowns. Those are more
dramatic than the rest of the picture, but they're chopped together
like a ransom note, all slivers and pieces. You catch Li in
bite-size chunks instead of the family-style helpings in his other
work, like the bravura punches and stag's leaps of the ``Once Upon
a Time in China'' series, films that raised the deadly swift Li to
a myth. (They're worth seeking out, no matter what part of town you
have to get to to rent them.)
</P>
<P>
   The camera prowls into each shot as if it's searching for an
opponent to throw down against; the movie itself seems to be
spoiling for a fight, though it doesn't have the attention span to
concentrate on the battles it does have. Li beats up his foes the
old-fashioned way: one at a time. Dreary as it is, ``Romeo'' is
bound to be a hit, thanks to its well-selected and wall-to-wall
hip-hop soundtrack _ particularly good songs by Timbaland and, yes,
Aaliyah _ that's so pervasive ``Romeo'' might as well be a musical.
DMX emerges as a star in the scattered proceedings. He establishes
so much audience rapport in his brief time onscreen that the film
suffers from his absence. DMX showed star power in ``Belly,'' his
debut, and he clearly takes acting seriously. More seriously than
``Romeo'' regards the able Jet Li. Sadly, if this movie was a
fight, they'd have stopped it.

<P>
   Two decades ago, New York had plenty of wine bars. Evolving out
of the wine boom of the 1970s, they were often equipped with
complicated wine-storing machinery and took themselves quite
seriously, with daunting lists, coat-and-tie stuffiness and an
attitude toward food that was either dismissive or overly reverent.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years about 20 places calling themselves wine
bars have opened in New York, some to considerable acclaim, and
none could be more different from those dinosaurs. They range in
style from the bright and lively Bateau Ivre in midtown to the dark
and romantic Tasting Room in the East Village and the casually chic
Bandol on the Upper East Side. Wine is still important, but the
pomposity is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   What most of them share is an easygoing ambience, late hours,
decent but not elaborate food, plenty of wine _ and a
live-and-let-live approach to drinking it. In other words, just
about what everyone wants in a restaurant. These new wine bars are
also mostly French, or aspire to be.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't do, singularly or collectively, is answer a
question that's been nagging me _ slightly _ since the first
outbreak of the trend: just what is a wine bar, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Even established restaurants are getting caught up in the new
enthusiasm for wine bars. Raju Mirchandani converted his uptown Bar
and Books into Ivre, and the people who have run Etats-Unis on the
Upper East Side for nine years have opened a separate wine bar
under the same name across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Etats-Unis has one of the more intriguing wine lists among the
new bars. I particularly liked the German, Alsatian and Austrian
offerings, if only because some are available in half bottles. A
half bottle of Zind-Humbrecht's gewuerztraminer at $15 is a
remarkable buy. Etats-Unis also has some interesting old-vine
Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   Le Bateau Ivre bills itself as a ``bistro a vins'' and as ``New
York City's first true French wine bar.'' It's very French,
actually, but don't be fooled: the French didn't invent the wine
bar, the English did. For years, the most authentic wine bars in
Paris were Steven Spurrier's Blue Fox and Mark Williamson's Willi's
Wine Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The French quickly caught on, and signs heralding ``bistro a
vins'' and ``bar au vins'' began popping up everywhere in Paris.
But the French have always taken their wine for granted, and even
cafe owners who had better selections than others rarely advertised
it.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who have always been serious about their wines,
were the first to open pubs more oriented toward the grape than
flat, warm beer. It's no accident that one of the first wine bars
in this country was the London Wine Bar in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The new wine bars offer remarkable selections of wine, whether
they are eclectic like Etats-Unis, all Italian like Enoteca I
Trulli, or French like Bateau Ivre and L'Ivre. I doubt that there
are many restaurants in the world that offer the choices to be
found in these ambitious little restaurants. What's more, there
can't be places more conducive than these for learning more about
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Le Bateau Ivre, which takes its name from a poem by Rimbaud _
his picture is on the wall _ is actually a pocket-size brasserie,
even with its 250 wines, most of which are available by the glass.
Its fans show up for the charcuterie and fresh seafood and good
beer as much as for the wine. But this is one of the few places in
New York to suggest pairing its oysters with breathtaking, acidic
gros plant from the western Loire. The writer Jacqueline Friedrich
calls gros plant ``a rude wine made from a rude grape (folle
blanche).'' I like to think of it as muscadet's evil twin.
</P>
<P>
   Le Bateau Ivre has, if not a twin, a younger sibling called
L'Ivre, an elegantly paneled remake of the Bar and Books at
Lexington Avenue and 73rd Street. On a recent cold, rainy night, a
glass of wine by the fire at L'Ivre felt like New York at its best.
The librarylike back room, with its book-filled shelves, has been
changed hardly at all, justifying the double-entendre name: ivre,
aside from meaning intoxicated, comes from Bateau Ivre and L'Ivre
(a play on livre, which of course means book). L'Ivre draws on Le
Bateau Ivre's formidable wine collection and offers a similar but
more limited menu of bistro dishes: coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon,
open-face sandwiches, -croques-monsieur and oysters.
</P>
<P>
   Like L'Ivre, the Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe in Rockefeller Center
has plenty of backup if its wine supply runs short. It is obviously
joined at the hip to the Morrell Wine Shop next door. This is a
no-nonsense little enterprise with around 100 wines by the glass
and a brief but thoughtful menu for the busy people who dash around
Rockefeller Center. Roast chicken is the partner of choice for most
wines, and Michael Haimowitz's version here will highlight any of
the 2,000 or so wines the Morrells sell next door. Well, maybe not
the Chateau d'Yquem.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ambitious wine program among the newcomers is
at the Tasting Room, where Colin and Renee Alevras offer some 300
wines by the bottle, all of them American. The by-the-glass list is
relatively short _ a dozen or so _ but it changes almost every
night so that, as Alevras put it, ``we can work our way through the
list with our guests.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not many wine lists, even in California, offer Ridge Vineyards'
alicante, three different single-vineyard zinfandels from Cline
Cellars in Contra Costa County, three roussannes, two marsannes and
an Oregon muscadet.
</P>
<P>
   The Tasting Room lives up to its name with a menu designed for
wine tasting. Each dish is offered as a taste or to share. The
current ``Almost Spring'' selections include roasted skate at $10
for a taste and $18 to share. A taste of foie gras ravioli is $10;
a share $20.
</P>
<P>
   Bandol is like so many of New York's putative wine bars: really
a restaurant with more than a passing interest in wine. The chef,
James Baron, is proud of his steak frites and his lamb shank, but
he will happily serve you something light merely to go with your
wine. For me it was thinly sliced foie gras and beautifully sauteed
sea scallops, both served on mixed greens. They were ideal with a
good Brouilly. There's a good selection by the glass, too.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose this is as good a place as any to own up to the fact
that while I love a good wine bar, I'm not a great fan of wine by
the glass. To get to know and enjoy a wine, you need more than a
glass of it and you need to share it with someone. That requires a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The one instance when a single glass of a wine makes sense is in
a comparative tasting, and for me, one of the few places where that
kind of tasting is neither boring nor pretentious is Enoteca I
Trulli, the wine bar attached to I Trulli, Nicola Marzovilla's
southern Italian restaurant on East 27th Street. Bucking the trend
to French-oriented wine bars, Enoteca I Trulli sells only Italian
wines and has become a showcase for little-known and reasonably
priced wines from Puglia, Campania, Abruzzi and Sicily. For
tasters, a flight of three wines _ two ounces of each _ goes for
$8.75 to $23.25.
</P>
<P>
   While just about anything from I Trulli's kitchen is available
in the Enoteca, there is a special, lighter menu to satisfy those
who are more or less serious about tasting wines. Rather severe
when it first opened, Enoteca has become a warm, laid-back little
place, a bit like the old cliched Greenwich Village joints with
candles in Chianti bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, are any of these places genuine wine bars? Is there such
a thing? I don't think so. A wine bar, after all, is whatever the
owner wants it to be. I think anyplace that is serious about its
wine list and offers a place to drink wine without having to buy a
full meal is entitled to be called a wine bar. The Oyster Bar in
Grand Central Terminal has a magnificent list of mostly white
wines, and an oyster stew at the counter qualifies anyone to drink
them. Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and Eleven
Madison Park all offer interesting wines by the glass to anyone who
sits at the bar; it isn't even necessary to eat anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Bubble Lounge and Flute downtown offer dozens of Champagnes
and sparkling wines by the glass. Veritas, in the Flatiron
district, offers some of the most expensive wines in the world,
mostly French, some by the glass. The Tonic in Chelsea is a
restaurant and an old-fashioned tavern under one roof, with several
dozen wines available at the bar by the glass. Does that make it a
wine bar? Should it?
</P>
<P>
   The French have been trying to define what constitutes a bistro
since some Russian invaders coined the term more than a century
ago. If they can't figure out ``bistro,'' I'm not going to lose any
sleep over ``wine bar.''

PUTIN'S PLANS AFTER THE ELECTION REMAIN A MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take to follow.)

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia ambles toward a second presidential election
almost surreal in its absence of sturm, drang or even
garden-variety suspense, perhaps its most amazing aspect is that
nobody yet has a clear notion of what the front-runner in the race
_ if it can be called a race _ will actually do if elected.
</P>
<P>
   That front-runner, of course, is Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting
president and the anointed successor to President Boris Yeltsin.
With but five days to the vote, Putin's name recognition is no
problem: His spare visage is plastered on every newspaper and
television screen and extolled by local kingpins in regions many
time zones away.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond manifestoes on the Internet and in Moscow newspapers,
extolling a mostly democratic regime adhering to somewhat
capitalistic rules, there is great doubt, even among experts, as to
where Putin plans to take the world's biggest nation. Some of his
few notable actions, in fact, point to a leader with a talent for
rhetoric, but considerably less intuition for the intricacies of
democratic checks and balances or Western politics.
</P>
<P>
   Russians pining for a pro-Western leader, for example, cheered
early this month when Putin met with NATO's secretary-general and
publicly raised the prospect that Russia would someday join the
organization. But anti-Westerners cheered a few days later, when he
said Russia not only has no hope of joining NATO, but doesn't want
NATO on its borders, either.
</P>
<P>
   Free-marketeers have banked on Putin's fervent paeans to
Western-style economics _ except during his frequent digressions,
such as last weeks' endorsement of a ban on most food imports to
prop up domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been heartened by Putin's written commitment to
political and social freedoms. And authoritarians must be equally
heartened by a string of draconian government pronouncements, such
as a recent promise to punish media outlets that publish interviews
with Chechen rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Such studious inscrutability seems so far to be Putin's
hallmark. The Russian firm Garant, which keeps a database of
government actions, tracked 1,000 of Putin's official decisions as
president during January and February. More than half were
classified; more than 100 others were minor personnel changes and
political appointments. The remainder, the company concluded,
betrayed little if anything about his attitude toward the nation's
competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in mid-March, reporters for the
newspaper Kommersant asked Putin whether the rumors were true that
he would become his own man upon his formal election, proposing
bold policies that would ``change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin was forthright, in his own vague way. ``I won't tell
you,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, some broad and reassuring _ to Westerners
_ suggestions of the future Putin course. His work as a business
liaison in St. Petersburg five years ago showed his comfort with
the capitalist system.
</P>
<P>
   And Western business interests generally praise his recognition
_ on paper, at least _ of the importance of free trade and open
markets. In particular, Putin has regularly argued that foreign
investment is essential to Russian economic growth. The nation
cannot advance, he has said, on the meager amount of capital that
domestic businesses generate.
</P>
<P>
   He also has made it clear that his Russia is in _ if not of _
the West. Putin has accepted European and U.S. overtures to end the
East-West estrangement brought about by the war in Kosovo. And
while it has continued to develop Russian alliances with China and
Iran, the Putin Kremlin has not dismissed outright the Western
concerns about human rights and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Putin talks convincingly of the need for a strong state and for
laws that apply equally to everyone. His manifestoes, on the
Internet and in Russian newspapers, speak of a society distinctly
Russian in its reliance on a strong state, but European in its
guarantees of freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those generalities, however, even experts disagree over
what sort of Russia Putin would build as president.
</P>
<P>
   His brief public career offers few clues. Putin's first
substantive job came in 1998, as head of the FSB, Russia's domestic
successor to the KGB. It was a sensitive post for Putin, who said
this month that he resigned the KGB in 1990 after learning that the
agency was leading a coup against the Soviet leader, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   The coup, he said, convinced him that communism and the Soviet
machine were going nowhere. But it remains unclear what ideology,
if any, replaced Putin's officially mandated commitment to Marxism.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports, obliquely denied by Putin, suggest that he cleaned
house when he became head of the FSB, purging the agency of its
Soviet-era holdovers. Publicly, he has defended the agency as a
guarantor of order and, for better or worse, a talented executor of
commands from higher-ups.

GORE AND BUSH SAY RULING CALLS FOR LIMITS ON TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, who
both employ senior advisers with close ties to the tobacco
industry, said Tuesday that the Supreme Court ruling on cigarette
regulation should spur Congress to enact stricter controls on
tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking to a community group in New York City on Tuesday
afternoon, said Congress should give the Food and Drug
Administration power to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug. He
accused Republican leaders of stalling on tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a statement issued by his campaign headquarters, called
on Congress and state legislatures to pass laws to restrict access
to tobacco by minors. Texas, he said, has already passed some of
the toughest such laws in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did not address the question that faced the Supreme
Court on Tuesday, whether the FDA should be empowered to regulate
tobacco as a harmful and addictive drug. A spokeswoman said Bush
had never answered that question and was not prepared to do so
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have ambiguous relationships with the tobacco
industry. Gore's top media adviser, Carter Eskew, helped create the
cigarette makers' $40 million campaign to defeat tobacco
legislation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's most trusted adviser, Karl Rove, helped draft a poll
financed by cigarette companies devised to thwart a lawsuit against
the industry by the state of Texas. Rove at the time was paid
$3,000 a month as a consultant to Philip Morris, the country's
biggest cigarette maker. The lawsuit was filed in 1996 by Dan
Morales, a Democrat, who was the state's attorney general. The
cigarette companies eventually settled the suit for $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has become a passionate opponent of the tobacco
industry, once bragged of working in the tobacco fields on his
family's farm in Tennessee and until 1990 accepted campaign
contributions from tobacco interests. He moved many at the 1996
Democratic National Convention with the story of the death of his
sister, Nancy Gore Hunger, from smoking-related lung cancer at the
age of 46.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Gore accused the cigarette companies of actively
recruiting teen-agers as ``replacement smokers'' for the 400,000
people who die each year of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush statement said the governor ``believes Congress should
pass tough laws to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids similar to
strict anti-teen smoking laws he advocated and signed in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas imposes fines on retailers who sell cigarettes to minors,
prohibits cigarette vending machines in areas accessible to
children and restricts tobacco advertising within 1,000 feet of
schools and churches.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Mankind battles Fate with a capital `F' in ``Les
Presages,'' the epic ballet by Leonide Massine that the Joffrey
Ballet of Chicago has just performed so magnificently as part of
its season here.
</P>
<P>
   As Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony rumbled to its climax, as
happiness vanquished evil and temptation onstage, Massine's famed
allegorical vision of 1933 became suddenly a metaphor for the
Joffrey's own triumphant battle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after severe financial problems pointed to the
possible demise of one of America's most popular ballet troupes,
its move from New York (including a legal reorganization and name
change from Joffrey Ballet to Joffrey Ballet of Chicago) is a
lesson in determined rescue strategy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Joffrey took over rented studios and offices in
downtown Chicago in October 1995, its $9 million budget had been
cut to $5 million and its dancers reduced to 30 from 40. It had
repeatedly canceled seasons in New York, where it has not been seen
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Things look very different now. On the artistic side, not only
performances but a rehearsal of George Balanchine's ``Square
Dance'' over the weekend reveal an amazing new perfection in
classical style. Gerald Arpino, the Joffrey's artistic director,
beams when asked if he and his ballet masters (Mark Goldweber,
Cameron Basden and Charthel Arthur) have recently concentrated on
toe work. But true to form, this is the Gerald Arpino whose
choreography has always been more concerned with spirit than steps.
No, he suggests, technique is not the only goal. ``I want them to
dance from the inside,'' he said, pointing to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   With typical Joffrey gumption and considerable help from an
expanding group of supporters in Chicago with high-powered civic
connections, the company has not only survived but acquired a
presence here that it never had in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has embraced the Joffrey,'' said Lois Weisberg, the
city's cultural affairs commissioner, noting that several factors
worked in the company's favor. Bereft of a world-class ballet
company that would match the reputation of its major arts
institutions, the business and arts communities here have been
energetic on the company's behalf. The Joffrey's new chairman is C.
Steven McMillan, the president and chief operating officer of the
Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe was also familiar to Chicago, having picked up a
following since it began performing here in 1957. ``They were held
in high esteem,'' Weisberg said. ``They were not perceived as
interlopers. It was not Joffrey Ballet of New York but Joffrey
Ballet of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley attends performances and ``is extremely
interested in the Joffrey,'' Weisberg added. ``He knew its
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest at the top helps. The Joffrey is about to acquire a
building in the downtown Loop area, a gift from Commonwealth
Edison, a utilities company. The $20 million renovation for
studios, offices and retail space is expected to receive some help
from the city through its tax-increment financing program, in which
the city provides incentive money for development in anticipation
of being repaid with increased real estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Joffrey's good luck to arrive in this revitalized
theater district in the Loop just as other arts organizations
(including the Goodman Theater) also move in, along with a
potential audience drawn by apartments recently converted from
offices and factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Chicagoan,'' Arpino, a longtime resident of Greenwich
Village, said with a straight face and then added convincingly, ``I
gave up my apartment in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Once dependent on touring, the Joffrey has identified itself
with Chicago by working to increase its presence here. The
company's budget has climbed back to over $9 million with no
deficits. In New York the Joffrey could afford an orchestra at City
Center, but even this weekend at the landmark Auditorium Theater
the music was, for economic reasons, on tape. Nonetheless, the
company's five-week ``Nutcracker'' season employs an orchestra and
last winter brought in $2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company performs in the Chicago area for 10 of its 37 work
weeks, which include rehearsal. There is also a concerted outreach
program with middle schools in the city. Since 1997 the company has
had a summer residency in Telluride, Colo., and resumed
international touring, with stops in Egypt, Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress, Arpino has no immediate plans to
come to New York. While the company is still rebuilding, intense
scrutiny might not help. ``What has happened is a miracle,'' he
said. ``We're a legend now, and I'm holding back. In New York, we
would be expected to be what we once were.''
</P>
<P>
   These remarks seem to imply that the company is not at full
strength in terms of repertory, number of dancers and finances. All
true, which makes the high artistic level of the dancing and
production values during the weekend's performances all the more
surprising. In addition to ``Les Presages,'' which was a major
Joffrey revival in 1993-94, the program included its well-known
staging of ``L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune'' by Vaslav Nijinsky and the
company premiere of Balanchine's ``Prodigal Son.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What Arpino really means is what the company's staff and
supporters here all insist upon: that the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago
is a new company, and its reason for being is to maintain the
continuity of vision of the Joffrey Ballet, founded in 1956 by
Arpino and Robert Joffrey, who died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do in 10 years what other organizations do in
40,'' said Bruce Sagan, a regional newspaper publisher and
businessman who has been president of the Steppenwolf Theater
Company and has been prominent in supporting cultural groups in
Chicago for decades. ``The first thing was to survive,'' Sagan
said. ``That meant we couldn't run deficits and that means you have
to make choices and set priorities. I too would like an orchestra
with performances, but that will come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort so far has gone into controlling the cost of
everything so that Gerry Arpino can rebuild the repertory and get
new dancers,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 few in the dance world would have bet on the Joffrey's
future. The troupe was deeply in debt (with a deficit of $1.6
million), and it was perceived as a touring company based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Jack R. Lemmon, executive director of the Joffrey Ballet of
Chicago, credits the New York board of the former company with a
strategic decision. ``The company needed to reinvent itself,'' he
said. ``It was a touring company that occasionally performed in its
home city. Now it is a resident company in Chicago that still does
national and international touring.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, with which it had
been ranked, the Joffrey had its home in New York. But whether New
York could support all three companies was a question. The company
did, however, have board members from Chicago and the Midwest and
it was this group that advocated a reorganized entity in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the artistic side, the turnaround has been even more
significant. Predictions were dire after the 1993 Joffrey premiere
of ``Billboards,'' a rock ballet to music by the Artist (still
Prince at the time).
</P>
<P>
   Arpino remains unapologetic for ``Billboards,'' and despite the
occasional scorn of critics, the ballet is credited in large part
with saving the company and keeping its dancers performing.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the repertory picture has changed. In addition to the
return of Arpino's own works and of 20th-century classics
previously performed by the Joffrey, there have been premieres by
Laura Dean and young choreographers like Randy Duncan, formerly a
dancer in the Joseph Holmes Company.
</P>
<P>
   This fall there was also the company premiere of ``Frankie and
Johnny,'' a landmark 1938 work by Ruth Page and Bentley Stone,
pioneers of American ballet in Chicago in the 1930's and 40's.
Other firsts for the company that Arpino plans to present are
Antony Tudor's ``Lilac Garden'' and Martha Graham's ``Appalachian
Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpino admits that ``in the first year here, when we had to
survive, I let the styles go down.'' But a visit with the three
former leading Joffrey dancers who have served as ballet masters in
the last two or three years does much to explain why the company's
32 dancers now look so stylish and technically strong. Eleven are
from the former company, with Deborah Dawn the senior ballerina and
best known. But some who were relatively new to the company in
1994, like Calvin Kitten, Davis Robertson and Maia Wilkins, among
others, have developed into strong and striking dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight Thursday and Friday was certainly ``Les
Presages.'' Basden's staging, based on the original Joffrey revival
by Tatiana Leskova, does a fabulous job of making a historical
curiosity come alive to modern audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet's interest lies less in its allegorical duel between
a generic hero and a gnomic Fate figure than in the movement
choruses that Massine borrowed from German modern dance in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Basden does wonders not only in featuring the women's strong toe
work, but also in the clarity she has achieved in the swiftly
moving contrapuntal patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as was not true before, the soloists in each movement
give Massine's once-surprising Neo-Classical choreography a
forceful projection. They included Wilkins, Dawn, Domingo Rubio and
Leticia Oliveira, and alternating as Fate, Robertson and Guoping
Wang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prodigal Son,'' although familiar at City Ballet and other
companies, is atypical Balanchine, his last experiment in a
Constructivist style. Kitten is too pure a classical dancer to
adjust immediately to its grotesque aspects. But by his second
performance Friday, he made his very young rebel persuasive.
Trinity Hamilton also did better as the Siren on the second night,
preserving her marvelous loose-hipped cool.
</P>
<P>
   When the Joffrey revived ``Faune'' in 1979, its minimalism and
potent sensuality were mesmerizing. Against an approximation of
Leon Bakst's woodland backdrop, lighted brilliantly by Kevin
Dreyer, the Faune still eats his grapes, scares off seven nymphs
and satisfies himself with a celebrated autoerotic climax. A new
literalism crept into Robertson's performance at the end on
Thursday. On Friday, it was markedly toned down by Rubio. Both were
marvelously intense. As in the good old days, a program at the
Joffrey was unlike any other.

   For example, you never want to mention the phrase search engine
to a Yahoo! employee. Because Yahoo is indexed by people, not
machines, it is known as a Web directory. Teams of editors review
sites and decide which ones should be classified where.
</P>
<P>
   Although this process can put the most relevant sites for a
search term closer to your fingertips, it also means that not as
many sites can be indexed as readily. LookSmart and Google are
other examples of directory sites.
</P>
<P>
   For Web site operators, human indexing also means that you can't
improve your site's ranking by simply changing the content. A
reviewer will have to revisit and rejudge your site.
</P>
<P>
   My own experience has been that indexed sites are good for
``quick hit'' information like contact phone numbers, general
background on a subject or even links to more detailed sites. They
are not updated as quickly as automated sites.
</P>
<P>
   Automated sites are truly search engines, so you can call them
that with impunity. Like directory sites, they also have their
glitches. Most build Web indices by ``spidering'' sites, meaning
that an automated browser physically clicks through pages and ranks
them based on the content. Lycos, Infoseek, AltaVista and HotBot
are all examples of automated sites.
</P>
<P>
   Spiders rank sites in different ways. First, they can read the
meta tag information in the head of the site pages. Those tags give
thumbnail information on the site content, which the spider uses to
determine the relevancy of that site to a submitted request.
</P>
<P>
   Some less-than-scrupulous Web designers exploit this method of
indexing, loading their pages with meta tags unrelated to the site
in order to get higher search rankings. That explains why your
search for baby carriages can turn up links to Wicked Wanda's
Painatorium or some other porn site. Most automated directories
will block sites from the index for misuse of tags information if
the staff becomes aware of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Spiders also can read the first several hundred characters of a
page to determine content. Unfortunately, sites that use graphics
rather than text are less likely to be accurately indexed in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of automated sites is that those spiders go just
about everywhere, whether an editor tells it to or not. If you are
trying to do an exhaustive search on a topic, you will probably
find more sources through an automated search site. The level of
relevance, however, can be spotty.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to find what you want is to make sure you ask the
question as precisely as possible. Using a plus or minus symbol
directly before a search term will force most engines to either
include or exclude sites containing that term. For phrase searches,
enclose your search term in double quotes. This way most search
engines will search for that string of words, not just any
appearance of any word in your search.
</P>
<P>
   This comes in handy if you are searching for, say, fresh cod
fingers. If you type it without quotes, you'll get hits from sites
that contain any one of those three words, no matter if the site is
for fresh flowers or Billy Bob's premium codpieces. With quotes,
the results are dramatically more focused.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the technology that drives the Web progresses,
these rules will become obsolete. At Ask Jeeves (www.ask.com), the
software will parse a question and return the most likely results
based on its interpretation of what you are looking for. Other
sites, like MetaCrawler or Dogpile, use an interface to send your
search to multiple search sites at once and report the results back
to you.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how advanced things get, one basic rule still holds.
If you speak clearly and ask nicely, you'll get whatever you want.
The same thing works for people, too.

 &HT;    Amid tears for slain officer exists plea to forgive suspected
killer
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fulton County sheriff's Deputy Ricky Kinchen ``loved
good church,'' his pastor said, and the nearly three-hour ceremony
Tuesday _ proclaimed a homegoing instead of a funeral _ would have
surely made him rapturous.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand people, most of them in the uniforms of police
and sheriff's departments from the metro area and around the state,
filled the huge sanctuary and balcony of Jackson Memorial Baptist
Church for the ceremony. There was singing, shouting, screaming,
and cheering as well as crying for the 36-year-old officer, shot
down Thursday night when he and his partner tried to serve an
arrest warrant for minor charges. The mood was lightened
considerably by the arrest Monday night of Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin,
the former H. Rap Brown, the man charged with killing Kinchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to forgive him,'' cried the Rev. Michael J. Gray,
pastor of Kinchen's small church, referring to Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' the congregation rumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' rejoined the preacher. ``He got a price to pay,
but you gotta forgive him!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved him like a brother,'' said Maj. Michael Cooke, chief
of the warrant service division, where Kinchen worked the
4-to-midnight shift with Deputy Aldranon English, who was seriously
wounded in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``God sent down a transmission to Ricky Kinchen Thursday
night,'' Cooke said. `` `Your watch is over,' He said. `You can go
Code 8 (the sheriff's radio code for going out of service or end of
shift) and be in service with the Lord for eternity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Antonio Sewell, a Fulton County deputy, opened the
service with a rich baritone rendering of ``I Won't Complain'' that
brought many of the mourners, uniformed and civilian, to their
feet. One elderly man leaped up and down, waving his program in one
hand and his cane in the other.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Gray's roaring, fist-waving eulogy that set the tone.
``Ricky was a dedicated man to God,'' he said as he warmed up. ``A
lot of people in our church didn't know he was a deputy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he talked with God after the shooting ``and I asked
him why, why him, why now. And I think He answered me.'' America
has strayed from religion, Gray roared, and ``He said, `I'm gonna
use Ricky to get the attention of this nation!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police motorcycle officers led a five-minute-long
motorcade from Turner Field to the church just outside Interstate
285. Kinchen's casket, draped with a U.S. flag, was brought to the
church at 10 a.m. under an escort of sheriffs' cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we lose an officer, whether it's from our department
or another department, it's like losing a family member,'' said
Cobb County police officer Brody Staud, who recalled the deaths
last summer of two Cobb County officers during a hostage standoff.
``It hurts every time it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take time to ease the hurt, but many deputies said they
took comfort in the arrest of Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps a lot,'' DeKalb County Sheriff's Major Nancy
Villalpando said of the news. ``Knowing he's not out there injuring
or hurting anyone else definitely helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said, ``Ricky's badge,
Badge 1008, will be retired from service, and I will now present
his badge to his family.'' The diminutive sheriff walked down from
behind the altar and handed the badge to Sherese Kinchen, the
deputy's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Sherese Kinchen seemed to hold up well during the ceremony. As
she emerged from the church behind the casket, a lone piper
somewhere out of sight playing ``Amazing Grace,'' she appeared
gaunt and worn, her two daughters clinging to her knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has a wonderful deputy standing guard in heaven,'' said
Mayor Bill Campbell. ``Each time we see our loved ones go out the
door, we should hug them tightly.''
</P>
<P>

Pendered and Dan Chapman contributed to this report.

 &HT;    Huge addition to the Museum of Fine Arts/Houston might be a
model for High's expansion
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If it were a movie, it might be called ``Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening Saturday, the new Audrey Jones Beck Building, built as
an expansion of the Museum of Fine Arts/Houston, is the biggest
project in a stampede of Texas construction that will result in
$750 million of new museums in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beck building, named for a benefactor who donated a
trove of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings, has its
own significance, as well. It stresses enormous, functional size _
a total of 192,447 square feet, with 84,400 devoted to galleries, a
number that moves the MFAH, in terms of exhibition space, from 30th
to sixth-largest museum in the country. (The High Museum of Art in
Midtown Atlanta and its downtown Folk Art and Photography Galleries
have combined exhibition space of nearly 40,000 square feet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a powerhouse, a very muscular demonstration,''
says Michael Shapiro, the High's acting director, referring to the
new museum. Shapiro has made a few visits to the Beck building,
while under construction, with local curators and patrons. One of
them, he said, described the Beck building as ``Texas big.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds may be as large.
</P>
<P>
   MFAH director Peter Marzio expects annual attendance to leap
from 1.3 million to 2 million in the Beck's first year, a figure
that could put his institution among the Top 5 art museums in the
country, rivaling such national destinations as the Art Institute
of Chicago and the Museum of Modern Art in New York _ but still far
behind the two national leaders, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
Manhattan and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, which
attract nearly 5 million people a year, according to recent figures
from the American Association of Museums. (An Atlanta comparison:
The High Museum drew 475,225 in fiscal year 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   As the High Museum awaits a final master plan that may well lead
to a major expansion, its leaders have looked at Houston and the
Beck building, the biggest addition to the Sunbelt's museum
landscape in years, for lessons in what they want to do. And what
they don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the to-do list, of course: raise money. The key to the
formidable $85 million Beck building is a wall of cool, blond
Indiana limestone almost 30 feet high and 60 feet long. It has
3,600 letters on it, each 7 inches to 8 inches tall, spelling out
the names of 170 major donors. A gift of at least $100,000 ensured
a donor's name would be engraved in perpetuity in this slab of
philanthropy which represents a spirited commitment, and yet
nothing unusual, in this city of big money and equally big arts
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the individuals, foundations and corporations carved
into this donor wall have gallery spaces named for them. The
smallest cost $300,000; the largest $10 million. And since donors
were asked to endow those spaces for maintenance, as well as
construction, the Beck building campaign has reached a total of
$127 million.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, the Beck building is
another milestone in the American museum building boom, a trend
that has been percolating for decades but seems to be accelerating,
heated by the strong economy and mega shows that set attendance
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bilbao is probably a turning point,'' says Shapiro, referring
to the audacious Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, whose 1997
opening entranced the art world. ``A city was transformed in the
world imagination on the basis of a single building. It fed this
sense that there's a kind of convergence between civic ambition and
architectural ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 museums _ art, history, science and others _ have
been built since 1970. Name almost any city large (Cincinnati,
Milwaukee, New York) or small (Davenport, Iowa; San Angelo, Texas),
and a new art museum has recently opened there or is in the works.
In Atlanta, the Woodruff Arts Center has hired Italian architect
Renzo Piano to redesign its Midtown campus, which includes the
High.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beck is responsible for ``radical'' innovations, says
Marzio, and museum insiders elsewhere have taken note. To reserve
as much space as possible to display its collections of European
and American art, the MFAH purchased two buildings nearby for
administrative offices and storage/conservation space.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the crowds coming, Marzio's team made a more
controversial move. It opened its arms to the automobile: A covered
drive dominates its main entrance. Pushed to its property line
limit, the Beck building can be viewed as anti-pedestrian, a blocky
container of stone (Indiana limestone again) connected by tunnels
under public streets to a parking garage/visitors' center, on one
side, and the original museum on the other side. (At least the
tunnel between the two museums is filled by James Turrell's
delightful installation ``The Light Inside,'' a neon and halide
light projection that plays with your sense of perception as you
walk through it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to respect the reality of the automobile,'' Marzio
explains. ``It was a matter of trying a multiple approach to the
museum, which did not tell the car it was unwanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Architect Moneo, 62, says it was an opportunity to address ``how
cars are able to live together with buildings,'' a crucial
consideration in any sprawling city but especially in a
metropolitan area of more than 4 million people whose mass transit
relies primarily on buses, with no subway or light rail.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the approach to the new museum feels like a fine art
drive-through seems a minor point when one considers the needs it
fills as an art repository and what Marzio calls an ``intensely
public'' gathering place. Certainly, anyone who's had to
painstakingly steer through packed Picasso and Rockwell shows isn't
going to gripe about the broad avenues of oak (for the permanent
collection) and terrazzo (for changing exhibits) running through
these galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the High's expansion would not be as large as the
MFAH's. And Shapiro makes clear the Atlanta museum is emphasizing a
more understated design that focuses on natural elements. Architect
Piano already has revealed his suggestion for a large cut-through
garden at the center. And the Woodruff's desire to cater to
pedestrians in its next phase is well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   Curious Atlantans will want to look at another Houston jewel,
the Menil Collection, also designed by Piano _ and run by Ned
Rifkin, the former High director who left in January _ for a bigger
clue as to what the Woodruff expansion might bring. The Menil's
softer, more contemplative nature is something High leaders are
seeking to complement Richard Meier's original building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a wonderful modernist sculptural statement on
Peachtree Street,'' Shapiro says, referring to Meier's creation.
``We don't need a Bilbao-type statement; it would give you
indigestion. We need something that is welcoming. That is calm.
That is gracious. And we're looking at something that's much more
open to nature (than the Beck).''
</P>
<P>
   He says the High is seeking something ``kind of in-between'' the
Beck building's dynamism and the ``more spiritual and tranquil
atmosphere of the Menil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin hails the Beck building as ``a testament to the strength
of Houston's commitment to the vitality of this city's growth and
development in the visual arts.''
</P>
<P>
   But he looks ahead with a competitive eye. ``Whereas the MFA
Houston is a point of entry for so many,'' he says, ``the Menil
Collection will become a true oasis for contemplation and
meditation of the finest art available to the people of Houston and
visitors to this city. It is where art can be seen to greatest
advantage.''

SALE OF AMERICAN CYANAMID GIVES AMERICAN HOME CASH TO SHOP FOR A
PARTNER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Home Products Corp. said Tuesday that it had agreed
to sell its struggling agricultural business to BASF, the German
chemicals giant, for $3.8 billion in cash _ a move that added to
Wall Street speculation that the drug company will try again to
find a corporate mate.
</P>
<P>
   But John R. Stafford, chairman and chief executive of American
Home, said in an interview Tuesday that the company, which has
failed to complete three proposed mergers in the last two years,
was not looking for another partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no conversations going on, no plans and no need,''
Stafford said. ``We've made it on our own since 1926. We're in a
better position now than we've been in sometime in terms of our
pipeline and balance sheet. There is no question that we can
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have flown on Wall Street about possible partners for
American Home ever since late last year when Pfizer upset the
company's plans to merge with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer began a
hostile takeover of Warner on Nov. 4, just hours after
Warner-Lambert agreed to buy American Home for $70 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pfizer won the battle for Warner-Lambert, American Home
walked away with $1.8 billion as a settlement for the break-up.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the agreement with BASF would add $3.8 billion more
to that stash of cash. Under the proposal, BASF will also assume
about $100 million of debt held by American Home's agricultural
business, known as American Cyanamid. American Home has been trying
since last year to sell its agricultural operations, which have
been hurt recently by the downturn in crop prices and by
competition from Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase would make BASF the fourth-largest agricultural
company in the world and greatly increase its presence in the
United States. Several large companies _ Bayer AG and Dow Chemical
_ were also competing to buy American Cyanamid.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that American Home could use the money to
attempt another merger with a competitor or to buy a smaller drug
company. The money will also help settle thousands of lawsuits now
pending against American Home filed by people who said they were
harmed by the company's diet drug combination, fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford said that the company planned to use some of the money
to strengthen its biotechnology operations. American Home owns 54
percent of Immunix, a biotechnology company in Seattle, which is
selling Enbrel, a drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Stafford said
American Home would soon invest $1 billion in a plant in Ireland to
make Enbrel and other drugs developed through genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The companies most often mentioned as the next potential
partners for American Home are Novartis and Pharmacia, the proposed
name of a company formed by the pending merger between Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn and Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all part of the general gossip in the business,'' said
Neil Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, a Swiss company, has applied to list its shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, a move that would allow it use stock,
rather than cash, to buy an American company. By buying American
Home, Novartis could greatly increase its share of America's drug
market, where companies can charge higher prices for drugs than
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also speculate that American Home could link up with
Pharmacia because Fred Hassan, the company's chairman, once worked
for Stafford as American Home's No. 2 executive.
</P>
<P>
   But Stafford said he was talking to neither Novartis or
Pharmacia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, American Cyanamid's sales of herbicide
have foundered because of competition from Roundup, the herbicide
made by Monsanto. In the mid-1990s, Monsanto began selling seeds
that had been genetically engineered to resist Roundup, allowing
farmers to spray the weedkiller over their fields without harming
the crops. Farmers have quickly snatched up the genetically
engineered seeds that save them both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   BASF is buying American Cyanamid amid a growing international
controversy over the genetically engineered seeds that could now
turn around in Cyanamid's favor. Some farmers are now questioning
whether to plant the seeds because of the growing unease among
consumers over the safety of the foods and crops harvested from
them. Some analysts think that Cyanamid's herbicide sales could
rebound as a result.
</P>
<P>
   By selling American Cyanamid, American Home will be able to
focus on selling drugs, a business with much higher profit margins
than agricultural chemicals and seeds. American Home, based in
Madison, N.J., sells Premarin, the hormone-replacement therapy for
women, which is one of the most prescribed drugs in the country.
The company also has a myriad of new drugs, including Sonata, a
sleep aid, and Prevnar, a vaccine for infants. The company also
makes over-the-counter products like Advil and Centrum vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that American Home must soon find a partner
because Stafford has indicated that he plans to retire in the next
few years. But Stafford said Tuesday that he had no immediate plans
to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 62 and in good health,'' he said.

   I Want My MP3
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a college student who listens to music I download from
the Internet. This is probably illegal and in a sense it is
stealing. Can I continue to do it, just as many ethical people
jaywalk? Or is this akin to walking into a store and stealing
something?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   A. To download music from the Net illegally is theft, depriving
songwriters, performers, music publishers and record companies of
payment for their work. I over Elton John's head and swatting him
with a stick until he sings ``Candle in the Wind'' (or stops
singing it, depending on your taste), but it is dishonest, and you
should not do it.
</P>
<P>
   Your temptation is understandable. In a perverse kind of social
progress, the Internet makes it easy to steal songs right in your
own home, while you're still in your pajamas. You might almost make
a case that it is unethical of Time Warner, say, to tantalize
honest music lovers beyond human endurance. This is a ticklish line
of reasoning, however, perilously close to blaming the victim. That
is, even if I sashay around town in a sport coat made of $100
bills, your robbing me is unethical. Unethical, but understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Yours is an intriguing sort of mischief, less likely to be
deterred by calls for individual rectitude than by technological
innovation. What stops many people from photocopying a book and
giving it to a pal is not integrity but logistics; it's easier and
inexpensive to buy your friend a paperback copy. Similarly,
technologies are or will soon be in place to encrypt music so that
it can't be stolen easily and that make it convenient to pay for
just the songs you want.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be all kinds of new ways to legally download music
_ by single cut, or for a limited number of plays, or for a limited
amount of time,'' Marc Morgenstern has told me. He runs new media
activities for ASCAP, an organization that protects publishers' and
songwriters' rights and collects their royalties. ''We're going on
the assumption that people want to be good, and we're looking for
ways to help make it easy for them to do the right thing.'' In
fact, ASCAP seems less interested in helping people be good than in
making it impossible for them to be bad. But if that system means
its songwriters can make a living and college students can walk in
the sun once again, that's not such a terrible thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a medical study in which patients received regular blood
transfusions, one blood donor was found to have Creutzfeldt-Jakob
(''mad cow'') disease. As there is no current evidence that the
disease is transmitted by blood, none of the patients were told
about the diagnosis. The researchers reasoned that the mental
anguish provoked by the remote possibility that a patient might be
infected by the donor was not worth disclosure. Did they make the
right choice?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Griesar, Portland
</P>
<P>
   A. They made the wrong choice _ a condescending and
paternalistic one. If I were a patient, I'd prefer to know as much
as I could about my treatment and its possible risks. As an adult,
I am capable of understanding what it means for a risk to be small
and a danger remote. And so, unless I've specifically instructed my
doctor to withhold certain information, he ought not to do so. That
said, knowing that many doctors have an honorable intention to
minimize a patient's anxiety, I must be assertive and solicit
information from my doctor.

APPEALS COURT LIFTS STAY OF EXECUTION FOR CHILD KILLER IN
TENNESSEE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ A federal appeals court Tuesday lifted a stay of
execution for a child killer in Tennessee, making it possible that
the state could carry out its first execution in 40 years early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a federal judge must decide the last issue on
appeal, whether the killer, Robert Glen Coe, 43, is mentally
competent and whether state courts properly considered his mental
state. Coe was convicted of kidnapping, raping and murdering
8-year-old Cary Ann Medlin in Greenfield in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Nixon of U.S. District Court in Nashville stayed
Coe's execution on Monday so the defense could pursue appeals. But
the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati Tuesday vacated
the stay and sent the case to another federal judge to decide the
competency issues. A separate appeal is before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Coe is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at 1 a.m. on
Thursday at the Riverbend Maximum Security Prison in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is the only Southern state that has yet to resume
executions since the U.S. Supreme Court re-instated the death
penalty in 1976. The South leads the nation in the number of
executions, with the 216 carried out by Virginia and Texas
accounting for about a third of the 623 executions in the United
States since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   While no death sentences have been carried out in Tennessee, the
state's juries have not been reluctant to impose them. There are 97
people on the state's death row, which makes it the 12th largest in
the nation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington, D.C.

 SURVIVOR OF PRINCESS DIANA CRASH DEFENDS HIMSELF 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September 1997, immediately after the death of  &UR; Princess &LR; 
 &UR; Diana &LR; , the only survivor of the crash was praised by  &UR; Mohamed &LR; 
 &UR; al-Fayed &LR; , father of Diana's lover, fellow victim  &UR; Dodi &LR; 
 &UR; al-Fayed &LR; . Also killed was driver &UR; Henri Paul &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The passenger who lived was bodyguard  &UR; Trevor Rees-Jones &LR; .
Al-Fayed brought Rees-Jones' mother and stepfather to Paris, put
them up in his palatial apartment and ferried them to and from the
hospital in his limousine. When he launched his own investigation
into the British ``conspiracy'' he believed responsible for the
crash _ he refused to place any blame on drunken driver Paul, whom
he had hired _ it became clear to Rees-Jones and his parents that
their agreement with and support of his point of view was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But Rees-Jones, whose head was battered in the accident, could
hardly remember the details al-Fayed expected him to provide as
evidence for his theory. When he refused to ``remember'' facts that
would corroborate the bereaved father's version of the story,
al-Fayed turned on him, blaming the deaths on the bodyguard's lack
of professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   All this was intensely painful to Rees-Jones, perhaps even more
so than recovering from blows that broke every bone in his face,
pushed his nose flat into his face and his eyes an inch and a half
farther apart than they'd been before. ``Everyone deserves a right
to reply,'' he told Personals in describing his reasons for writing
``The Bodyguard's Story'' (Warner; $25.95). ``Certain accusations
have been thrown at us in the media. This is our right.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much publicity early on, for example, about Rees-Jones
allegedly wearing a seat belt while Di and Dodi weren't. This was
considered unprofessional for a bodyguard, who is supposed to have
freedom to move around in a vehicle. Rees-Jones couldn't remember
whether he'd been belted.
</P>
<P>
   But when French investigators determined that he was not belted,
published news accounts tended to overlook the finding. This book,
he said, will set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, he has ``two years' worth of legal bills to
pay'' as the investigation of the case, with a possibility of
criminal charges being leveled, worked its way through the French
courts. Rees-Jones wouldn't say how much advance he received for
the book, but he did say he was deeply in debt to his French
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The French legal team introduced Rees-Jones to New York agent
 &UR; Michael Carlisle &LR; , who in turn suggested that he tell his story to
 &UR; Moira Johnston &LR; , who lives in the Napa Valley and is the respected
author of several investigatory books, including ``Spectral
Evidence,'' an exploration of memory and truth in the Ramona sexual
assault case.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the book were kept secret for fear al-Fayed would
launch legal action to stop its publication. (He sued
unsuccessfully in London, where portions of the book were published
in newspaper excerpts, in early March.) The manuscript was edited
behind closed doors; Rees-Jones, Johnston, Carlisle and the
publishers maintained deep confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The author, speaking by phone on Monday, March 20, from New
York, where he was doing a slew of media interviews, said he was
determined to get his story across unhindered and therefore would
refuse to sell rights to TV or the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this in the way of drawing a line under the
accident,'' he said. ``This is what I know, and this is what I'm
prepared to say. I don't want to pass it over to anyone else, I
want to put it behind me. If it became a movie or TV show, there
would always be somebody else's angle on it, and I wouldn't be
happy about it.''

CLINTON SEEKS TO BUILD NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA
</HEADLINE>
   (See also INDIA-KASHMIR) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The United States and India opened what they
called an era ``of new beginnings'' on Tuesday in an effort to
rebuild a relationship that President Clinton said had been
neglected for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of encounters, including a sharp rebuke of the
president on Tuesday night, showed that the opening chapter was
spiked with surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of a massacre of about 40 Indian Sikhs in the
Indian held part of Kashmir just before Clinton's official visit,
the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the president
signed what they called a ``vision statement.'' It defined their
common interests while pointing out that they disagreed on India's
possession of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with Vajpayee, Clinton said that the two countries'
relationship was ``too important to ever fall into disrepair
again.'' Thus, the two countries said the joint statement was a
device to lay the foundation of an American-Indian relationship
without letting precise issues slow the process.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, the tensions inherent in forging an
Indo-American friendship surfaced when India's president, Kircheril
Raman Narayanan, rebuked the president in a toast at a state dinner
on Tuesday night. Standing before Clinton at a long banquet table,
Narayanan scolded Clinton for his description of the Indian
subcontinent ``as the most dangerous place in the world today.''
The president has publicly used that term twice in the past two
months to describe a situation where India and Pakistan, two
neighboring countries, have nuclear weapons and are also at the
edge of a conflict in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   But Narayanan, in a rare display of blunt talk at a black-tie
diplomatic affair, said that this description was ``alarmist.''
``It has been suggested that the Indian subcontinent is the most
dangerous place in the world today and Kashmir is a nuclear flash
point,'' the Indian president said. ``These alarmist descriptions
will only encourage those who want to break the peace and indulge
in terrorism and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not reply to the chiding, choosing in his toast to
stick to his theme of friendship. The president's day began here
with a formal review of Indian armed forces assembled in the
courtyard of the colonial-era presidential palace, Rashtrapati
Bhavan, and then moved on to a wreath-laying ceremony at the
memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   The president then drove through roads, swept clear of people to
Hyderbad House, a former princely residence, for his meeting with
Vajpayee, the prime minister. Vajpayee, the 72-year-old
white-haired leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, and Clinton had not met before.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Indian leader is not considered an easy
conversationalist, there was some uncertainty among administration
officials about how the talks would proceed. Afterward, an
administration official said that the ``tone was good but it would
be misleading to say that there was a brisk and free flow of
ideas.'' The measured atmospherics in the encounter with the prime
minister combined with the sharp comments by the Indian president
seemed to underline the difficulty of Clinton's undertaking to
improve the Indian-American relationship without having the United
States appear to be a superpower that was lecturing.
</P>
<P>
   From the time India first tested nuclear weapons in May 1998,
Washington has tried to convince the government here that its
maintaining a nuclear deterrent was not helpful to peace in the
region. But India, striving to be more than just a regional power,
sees its nuclear weapons as the right of an emerging major power
that is a neighbor not only to Pakistan but also to China.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony marking the signing of the ``vision statement'',
Vaypayee warned that India had limited tolerance for the violence
in Kashmir, which it accuses Pakistan of masterminding. ``We have
the means and the will to eliminate this menace,'' the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement itself included a summary of the differences on
nuclear weapons. It said in part: ``The United States believes
India should forego nuclear weapons. India believes that it needs
to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with
its own assessment of its security needs.'' It went on:
``Nonetheless, India and the U.S. are prepared to work together to
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of
delivery. To this end, we will persist with and build upon the
productive bilateral dialogue already under way.''
</P>
<P>
   In elaborating on the statement at the appearance with Clinton,
the Indian prime minister said he had repeated in their private
meeting India's commitment not to conduct further nuclear explosive
tests and not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In replying, Clinton recognized that India was not close to
signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, a position that
Washington has been urging on the government without success since
the 1998 test. The president said he hoped that the ``democratic
process'' in India would lead to the eventual signing and
ratification of the treaty in India, just he added, ``like I hope
the democratic process will ultimately produce a ratification of
the test ban treaty in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings in Kashmir Monday night, which American officials
said appeared designed by Pakistani-backed insurgents to draw
Washington into a mediation of the dispute between India and
Pakistan, presented Clinton with an opportunity to stress his
prepared message of restraint between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear before coming here that he was not planning
to mediate the Kashmir dispute _ a roll that the Indians reject but
which the Pakistanis want.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials interpreted a statement by Clinton as an
embrace of their position that Pakistan must stop infiltrating
Kashmir with militant fighters before talks can start. Clinton
sounded as though he was saying just this when, in his joint
appearance with Vajpayee, he said that talks between India and
Pakistan could not be expected ``unless there is an absence of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials quickly tried to clarify Clinton's intent,
saying that because the United States was not a party to any talks
between India and Pakistan, it could not set any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior administration official said that the Indians
should take heart from the message of support'' that Clinton
delivered against the violence in Kashmir.

WHO'S GOT THE SOUND? BABY MOGULS AND TECHIES

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``It's chaos out there right now,'' said Tim
Quirk on Saturday afternoon, briefly retreating from the
barbecue-munching crowd at Fat Tuesday's, one of many patio-style
beer joints here. Quirk wasn't just making the usual observation
about South by Southwest, the music, film and multimedia conference
that concluded Tuesday. He was addressing a particular kind of
chaos: the free-for-all over music on the Internet that enthralled
this year's convention-goers as intensely as it has the industry in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been this giddy since the needle dropped on the
first Clash record,'' said Quirk, a managing editor at Listen.com,
the online music directory that helped sponsor this year's festival
and was host of the Fat Tuesday's bash, where the underground pop
bands Beulah, Polara and Saltine played sparkling sets. ``I
understood how this was going to revolutionize the music
business,'' he added. ``I wanted front-row seats at the revolution,
and they gave me a gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Quirk exemplifies one aspect of Web music's new school: the
devotee drawn to a Web job by high hopes and opportunity. He was a
freelance writer and stay-at-home dad when he learned about
Listen.com through a press release and called to see if any jobs
were available. He had never worked in an office before. Now here
he was, staying at the Four Seasons, a member of an establishment
that seems to be superseding the one he had battled as a member of
a punk band.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous influence of Web music on the music segment of
South by Southwest exposed the ferocious effects of new technology
on the record business. On one level, the festival proceeded as
usual, with sentimental favorites like Steve Earle and Patti Smith
and newcomers like Beachwood Sparks and Fu Manchu garnering buzz
from eager audiences. Shelby Lynne worked her hard country charm at
the Austin Music Hall; Japanese rock fans bopped to Puffy at the
Park Avenue. The hip-hop contenders Dead Prez freestyled at Stubbs,
while the Mekons, those adored indie rock veterans, closed the
festival at Antones.
</P>
<P>
   But the thrill of the new wasn't with the musicians. It belonged
to the techies and entrepreneurs who spoke on packed panels,
sponsored lavish parties and displayed their wares at a trade show
overflowing with free goods. Promoting Internet radio stations,
entertainment guides, online stores and multiservice sites, these
networking demons were the week's real rock stars, riding a wave of
hype and vision.

<P>
   On panels where they squared off with established executives and
in private conversations that were half sales pitch, half
manifesto, the Web rockers held the festival's spark. Idealists
like Quirk championed the independence that downloadable music
offers artists and fans in allowing them to sidestep the music
industry's protective gates. Industry veterans clued into the
shifting landscape debated how those gates might be adapted so that
the music will still generate profit. Still others, more baby
moguls than music maniacs, had smelled the money in a transforming
arena and sought to position themselves in its flow.
</P>
<P>
   The Web rockers have laid claim to the music's old-fashioned
outlaw spirit. Some are in fact engaged in lawsuits with the
Recording Industry of America, which is trying to rein in
technologies that supposedly promote piracy. The RIA has
specifically accused two major companies, MyMP3.com and
Napster.com, of copyright infringement for advancing the
distribution of music over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the accused companies avoided discussing the
lawsuits, but many of their peers defended them with
countercultural arguments. Napster, a file-swapping community
connected by software designed by two 19-year-old MIT students,
particularly seemed to entrance Web rockers. Napster allows members
access to one another's MP3 collections, theoretically eliminating
the need to purchase CD's altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of some, this finally frees music from ``the
Man.'' Detractors reminded defenders that Napster doesn't pay
artist royalties. Web rockers argued that a system of artist
remuneration is evolving. It's hypocritical, they said, to act as
if the current system is the best for artists when low royalty
rates have always been a source of shame. Better to think of how
the changing technology is redefining the ``product'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two streams of thought here,'' said Ben Fong-Torres,
a longtime rock journalist who is now the editor of the MyPlay.com
site. ``One is the griping, and that has turned old. The second is
the dot-com world, along with the younger artists. There's
excitement about what it's doing, but some people are running
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   John Parres, a member of the Artists Management Group and
co-founder of Pho, a popular e-mail list connecting
music-technology aficionados, artists and managers, expressed
satisfaction at the nervousness of industry veterans. ``The record
labels have had the upper hand,'' he said. ``Many of the people in
Pho have been on the short end of the stick. We realize the system
is broken.''
</P>

<P>
   Sexy leather and spiky hair wasn't in evidence at Friday's Pho
gathering, held, as the group's regional conclaves always are, over
bowls of the Vietnamese soup for which it is named. Excitement was
generated by the flow of ideas and the sense that someone in the
room might have the key to the new Napster, the next thing to make
music freer and, of course, more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll careers have always been equal parts hustle and
revolt, tainted by the sins of payola and artist exploitation but
blessed by the serendipity of getting paid to make noise. The most
alluring Internet entrepreneurs project a similar recklessness. It
can be hard to work that pose when you're designing
office-management platforms, but it's the easiest thing in the
world when your service brings the latest Limp Bizkit track to
rabid fans.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Web rockers were eager to point out, the latest tracks by
artists that fans might otherwise never hear. Joe Fleischer, who
recently left his influential ``Wheels and Deals'' column at the
trade publication Hits to become a vice president at MP3.com,
shared what is becoming an axiom in the world of Web music: that
the person served best by all this innovation is the ``middle-class
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the North by Northwest festival in Portland, Ore.,
last year,'' he said during an impromptu Web site demonstration,
one of 50 per day he said he had given to interested executives.
``Nobody from the industry had come. But all the bands were there.
And I realized there was this middle class of artists emerging _
bands that had been dropped, bands that were never going to be on
the radio _ and going to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Trachtenberg, a director of creative content for
Emusic.com, echoed Fleischer's sentiments in explaining what he had
accomplished at South by Southwest. ``I just licensed Daniel
Johnston's catalog, and I had dinner with Mojo Nixon last night,
started working out a deal with him,'' he said. ``I saw the Mooney
Suzuki three times.'' Trachtenberg was as delighted to know these
obscure artists as an old-style music-business type might have been
to hang out with the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   This focus on the new and the small is smart business that has
the advantage of appearing principled. Web rockers will probably
abdicate some of their openness, not to mention their endlessly
reiterated concern for fans, once their nascent business models
jell. But they're starting with a powerful stance. They're a little
ruthless, very arrogant and full of joy, which is how legendary
record men like Jerry Wexler and Sam Phillips were when they began.
</P>
<P>
   But Wexler had Aretha Franklin, and Phillips had Elvis. South by
Southwest demonstrated that even as technology offers countless new
pop thrills, music itself is in a circling pattern, with plenty to
enjoy but few surprises. Perhaps the Web rockers will really be
stars when they find some new voices to champion. That's when all
this hoopla will really feel like rock 'n' roll.

EMPLOYERS LAMENT HIRING IN HASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Mass., N.J.)   (Eds., spelling Allied Domecq is CQ) 
 (DW) 
 By CHARLES BUTLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies that dawdle in hiring promising candidates may lose
them to the competition, but Margie Mosher does not care. She has
learned her lesson, and nobody gets a job at Allied Domecq Quick
Service Restaurants until a thorough background check is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher, working in Randolph, Mass., is the personnel manager at
that division of Allied Domecq, the British holding company for
food retailers like Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins. She recalls
that a company manager who urgently needed to fill a position last
year presented her with a ``phenomenal resume.'' On it, the
candidate listed graduate and undergraduate degrees from a noted
school, a professional accreditation helpful for financial work and
the skills required for the Allied Domecq job opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met this individual, and he had all the answers,'' Mosher
said. ``He had the experience and the credentials.'' The company
was ``within minutes'' of hiring him, she added, when she received
a background report from an outside firm that left her in shock.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate had no graduate degree, had been stripped of his
accreditation and even had a criminal record. ``The only thing we
didn't find was a bad driving record,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Domecq may have averted a hiring disaster, but in today's
tight job market, a lot of companies do not show the same sort of
diligence. That can spell trouble, according to executive
recruiters and people at companies that specialize in background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, especially Internet start-ups desperate to fill
large numbers of openings, openly acknowledge that they lack the
time and resources to verify all the information that job seekers
submit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been sloppy, but it has gotten even sloppier,''
Ed Dunn, a former corporate vice president for human resources at
the Whirlpool Corp. and now a consultant, said of corporate
procedures for checking on job candidates' backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Samer Hamadeh, chief executive of Vault.com, a Web site for job
seekers that provides information on careers and companies, says
that although he requires full background and reference checks on
applicants for senior executive positions, he is less demanding for
lower-level openings. ``What we do is make the offer, but then tell
them it is contingent on a background check,'' Hamadeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Even recruiters of senior-level managers confess that the
frantic competition for talent can blind them to danger signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if a bird flies, you go for it,'' said Peter Crist, vice
chairman of Korn/Ferry International, the global executive
recruiting firm. ``What happens is, in a high-velocity market like
this, it becomes more mistake prone.''
</P>
<P>
   To guard against laxness, Crist has begun checking references
before he calls the applicant about a position; previously, the
process of checking the references would not begin until an
executive became a serious candidate for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced hiring managers know the dangers of letting down
their guard. In a 1998 survey by the Society for Human Resource
Management, 90 percent of human resources professionals said they
had encountered candidates who had falsified the lengths they had
held previous jobs and the salaries they had earned, while 78
percent in the survey said they had come across applicants who had
lied about their college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Even little lies can derail a job hunter's chances if they are
detected, corporate managers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lied about something that doesn't really matter, for
example, your degree, why wouldn't you lie about something else?''
Mosher asked.
</P>
<P>
   For employers, the failure to ferret out the fabrications can
create enormous headaches. Recently, James Mulvaney, the director
of research for forensics and litigation at the accounting firm
KPMG LLP, did background checks on employees at a New Jersey car
dealership where millions of dollars was missing. The stolen money
was later traced to a sales manager who, Mulvaney discovered, had
spent six years in Rahway State Prison for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Mulvaney, a former investigative reporter for Newsday, The Daily
News and The Orange County Register, where he supervised a staff
that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1996 for a series of articles on fraud
by fertility doctors, remembers wanting to ask the dealership's
managers: ``What were you guys thinking? Did you look at his resume
and notice that there were six years missing?''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that conduct pre-employment background checks for
employers say business has increased in recent years as smaller
concerns have parceled out work they used to try to do themselves.
Aided by Web-based search tools, the firms say, they can usually
investigate a candidate's job history, credit rating and criminal
record within 48 hours for costs ranging from $15 to $90.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, Powerpay.com, which provides payroll
service for small businesses, began offering clients access through
its Web site to ChoicePoint Inc., one of the country's largest
pre-employment screeners.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher has used Business Directions Inc., of Atlanta, for
background searches on Allied Domecq job applicants. In the case of
the candidate with a bogus degree, a credit check by Business
Directions disclosed a former residence and employer not listed on
his application. That discrepancy prompted Business Directions to
dig deeper, uncovering his criminal record along the way.
</P>
<P>
   A mandatory background-check policy can annoy managers who are
itching to snag a hot prospect before a competing offer arises. But
Mosher urges personnel managers not to be swayed by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take offense because they think you are questioning their
personal judgment,'' she said. ``And to put things into
perspective, we don't get these types of bad reports all that
often. But when you run into a situation where there is a glitch,
we're glad we found out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If some companies are relaxing the vigilance in the current
economic boom, others are being extra cautious.
</P>
<P>
   OnTarget Inc., a sales training company in Atlanta, requires
that no job offer can be made until a candidate's background check
is completed and at least two references have been called.
</P>
<P>
   To further help keep disreputable applicants at bay, the company
now offers OnTarget employees as many as three cash bonuses if an
applicant they recommend is hired and stays with the company a full
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an employee knows of a good co-worker from a past life and
that worker comes aboard, we're happy to pay a fee to the
employee,'' said Marianne Haskins, the director of human resources.
``Then you have the personal recommendation of someone you know and
trust.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a sharp blow to
the Clinton administration's efforts to curb smoking, ruling 5-4
that the Food and Drug Administration had never received authority
from Congress to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, rejecting rules that the FDA proposed in 1995 to
restrict the marketing of cigarettes to minors, hands the question
of national tobacco regulation back to Congress. An effort to
confer jurisdiction on the FDA won some bipartisan support in
Congress in 1998 but became mired in a broader debate over whether
to give the cigarette industry immunity from damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling was notable for the strong language that both
the majority and the dissenting opinions used in describing the
dangers of smoking, which causes some 400,000 deaths a year in the
United States. Although essentially a straightforward ruling on a
question of administrative law, the decision paid more than usual
attention to the underlying policy issues, as if in recognition
that the debate will continue elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who said in her majority opinion
that the FDA had ``amply demonstrated'' that tobacco use was
``perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in
the United States,'' sounded at times almost apologetic for her
conclusion that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which the agency
used to assert jurisdiction, could not be stretched far enough to
accommodate the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In the dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that
given nicotine's highly addictive nature and the ``life-threatening
harms'' of smoking, the FDA's authority should be interpreted in
light of ``its basic purpose _ the overall protection of public
health.'' He said the court should avoid an ``overly rigid''
interpretation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ``that is
divorced from the statute's overall health-protecting purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David A. Kessler, the former FDA commissioner who led the
agency in reversing its long-held position that it could not
regulate tobacco, said Tuesday that the loss in court had ``in some
ways moved the issue forward'' through the justices' recognition of
the dimensions of the problem as a public-health issue. ``We're in
a very different place than we were five years ago,'' said Kessler,
now the dean of Yale Medical School, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority Tuesday applied a settled principle of
administrative law: if Congress has spoken clearly on a question of
an agency's jurisdiction, or lack of jurisdiction, Congress has the
last word. ``The FDA's claim to jurisdiction contravenes the clear
intent of Congress,'' O'Connor said. The dispute between the
majority and dissent was over the clarity of Congress' intent,
which the dissent found to be much less evident.
</P>
<P>
   The decision upheld a 1998 ruling by the 4th Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals, in Richmond, Va. Four cigarette manufacturers _ Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co.
and U.S. Tobacco Co. _ along with the National Association of
Convenience Stores had gone to federal court to challenge the
regulations as soon as the FDA formally issued them in 1996. A 1997
ruling by Judge William L. Osteen Sr. of U.S. District Court in
Greensboro, N.C., upheld the agency's jurisdiction over controlling
children's access to cigarettes, but struck down the regulations'
restrictions on advertising and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the authority of the district court's decision, the FDA
has since 1997 been spending about $34 million a year on contracts
with the 50 states to help monitor compliance with state laws
barring the sale of cigarettes to those under 18. The FDA on
Tuesday began to send letters to the states announcing an ``orderly
shutdown'' of the compliance program in light of the Supreme Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion in the case decided Tuesday, Food and Drug
Administration vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson, No. 98-1152, was joined by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Breyer's dissenting
opinion.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This particular 5-4 split has become familiar during the last
few years, with the more conservative justices on one side and the
relatively more liberal ones on the other. Yet there was nothing
overtly ideological about the essentially historical question of
whether a 1938 statute, or any subsequent legislative developments,
conferred jurisdiction on a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   But a distrust of the power of administrative agencies has long
been a watchword of legal conservatives, and this case reached the
court within a broader context of renewed ferment over the
constitutional boundaries of the modern administrative state.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Washington issued a startling
decision last year, holding that in authorizing the Environmental
Protection Agency to issue certain regulations under the Clean Air
Act, Congress engaged in an unconstitutional ``delegation'' of its
legislative powers to an executive branch agency. As the justices
were undoubtedly aware, the Clinton administration has recently
asked them to review that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion Tuesday, Breyer appeared to go out of
his way to refute any suggestion that an agency's action is
insulated from political accountability. ``Insofar as the decision
to regulate tobacco reflects the policy of an administration, it is
a decision for which that administration, and those politically
elected officials who support it, must (and will) take
responsibility,'' Breyer said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that an administrative agency decision of
this magnitude _ one that is important, conspicuous, and
controversial _ can escape the kind of public scrutiny that is
essential in any democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA regulations were based on the premise that most people
who become lifelong smokers start smoking in their early teens. To
discourage teen-age smoking, the regulations prohibited the sale of
cigarettes to those under 18; the distribution of free samples or
the sale of packages of fewer than 20 cigarettes; and the use of
self-service displays or vending machines except in adults-only
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers were required to verify, through photo identification,
the age of all purchasers younger than 27. There were also
restrictions on outdoor advertising near playgrounds and schools
and on promotional items and sponsorship of various events by
cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency claimed its authority under the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, which gives it jurisdiction to regulate ``drugs'' and
``devices.'' Drugs are defined in the 1938 law as articles, other
than food, ``intended to affect the structure or any function of
the body.'' Nicotine was such a substance, the FDA said, and
cigarettes were devices for delivering nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's assertion of authority over tobacco in 1995 came after
decades of disclaiming such jurisdiction. The agency justified its
about-face by pointing to newly disclosed internal cigarette
industry documents showing that the industry understood and
intended to achieve nicotine's effects _ thus meeting for the first
time the statute's requirement that any effect be intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry objected immediately that Congress had
never meant to give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco. Parsing the
statute, industry lawyers provided a syllogism that the majority
today found persuasive. The agency's core mission, the industry
argued, was to make sure that drugs reaching the market were safe
and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Because the FDA found cigarettes to be unsafe, it was required
under the law not simply to regulate them but to ban them. But, the
argument went on, Congress clearly did not intend that result,
because since 1938, it has passed a half-dozen measures dealing
with smoking that were obviously based on the assumption that
cigarettes would continue to be marketed. The notion that the FDA
could treat tobacco as it would an ordinary drug was simply
misbegotten, the industry said.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting that argument, O'Connor said Tuesday that ``the
inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco
products'' within the law's structure. ``If they cannot be used
safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned,
they simply do not fit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Where the majority found certainty, the dissent found Congress'
treatment of smoking to be ``critically ambivalent'' in several
important respects. For administrative law purposes, the difference
between congressional clarity and ambiguity is crucial, because
once the court decides that Congress has spoken ambiguously about
an agency's authority, its precedents require judges to defer to
the agency's view of the matter.

CONTINUED BAD AIR QUALITY COULD COST TEXAS $1 BILLION IN HIGHWAY
FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By NEIL STRASSMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The federal government could withhold as much as
$1 billion in highway funds if Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston do not
have adequate plans to clean the air, state senators were told
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and state transportation officials, testifying at
a hearing on air quality before the state Senate Natural Resources
and State Affairs committees, said the state's highway funds are
safe and the plan to cut smog will be delivered on time.
</P>
<P>
   But at the six-hour hearing, senators had a tough time grasping
how not building roads would reduce pollution, particularly since
50 percent of it is caused by cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to add some common sense to this deal,'' said
Sen. Ken Armbrister, R-Lake Jackson, who questioned Carl Edlund,
the federal Environmental Protection Agency's regional planning and
permitting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doublespeak,'' he muttered after Edlund explained the federal
law, the 1990 Clean Air Act, and recent court decisions that allow
the EPA to impound highway funds if a region with a serious smog
problem does not have an approved air quality plan.
</P>
<P>
   The clean air plan for North Texas must be presented to the EPA
by the end of April. The plan for Houston, now the smoggiest city
in the nation, must be submitted by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be worse off by the 2007 deadline than we are today
unless we implement strategies to curb ozone,'' said Jeff Saitas,
executive director of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission, the state's environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have clean air, power for people in the
summertime and roads that get people from one place to another,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Heald, executive director of the Texas Department of
Transportation, said his agency ``has no intention of letting any
funds escape from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dallas-Fort Worth plan barely squeezes under the federal
health limit for ozone. The plan has been weakened in recent weeks
by attacks from businesses and communities that don't want to
participate, and may not now be rigorous enough to pass muster by
the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups said the threat of losing highway
dollars finally got Texas' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally got serious when federal highway funds would be
pulled and now there are serious plans to improve the air,'' said
Jim Marston, Austin executive director of Environmental Defense, a
national environmental advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take away the sanction and they could revert to doing
nothing,'' said Marston, who did not attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The task of cutting smog in Houston is so tough that state
officials have even considered banning driving on a rotating basis
every fourth or fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Clark, a transportation official from the Houston/Galveston
Area Council, told the senators that a no-drive day is still on the
list of possible measures for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of our effort should be on technology and cleaner
fuels and engines, not on changing behavior,'' Clark said.

 &HT;    Suspect known as friendly visitor in Ala. town where he was
captured
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE HALL, Ala. _ The rural crossroads town where Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin's run from the law ended Monday is only a few
miles from the scene of perhaps his greatest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, it was the good times that most people around here
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Favor, an elderly man who'd just caught himself a snapping
turtle for dinner, said he remembered Al-Amin well; they worked
together in the local civil rights movement in the 1960s when
Al-Amin was known as H. Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of friends around here, because he stayed out
here and worked with us,'' Favor said. ``I was real surprised when
I heard he had done a shooting. Rap Brown was a nice guy, but he
didn't take no fooling.''
</P>
<P>
   Favor and other Alabama friends and acquaintances of Al-Amin
expressed disbelief that he could have been involved in last week's
shooting of two Fulton County sheriff's deputies in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they recalled the dangerous days of the civil rights
movement, when a young Al-Amin came to Lowndes County, Ala., and
was a key figure in the struggle to gain the vote for
disenfranchised black people.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of Al-Amin's capture is about five miles from where
Brown and other leaders of the Lowndes County Christian Movement
for Human Rights in the 1960s set up a tent city where they
conducted an historic registration drive for a county where
virtually no blacks were on the voter rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came down here (after the shooting) simply because he had
friends down here,'' said John Hulett, county probate judge. In
1970, Hulett was elected Lowndes County sheriff, the first black to
hold that office; he largely attributed that victory to the
voter-registration efforts led by Al-Amin and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him in 1965, when he first came to Lowndes,'' said
Hulett, now 72. ``He was level-headed, a good fund-raiser, and
motivated to get people registered.'' After the voter registration
drives, roads, schools and housing improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been able to step up because of what we were able
to do together. It cost us some lives, but at the same times, we
were able to make some progress,'' Hulett said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Al-Amin continued to visit. Hulett saw him
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised something like this could happen. It got
to me. The idea that he would be involved in this is hard to
believe,'' Hulett said.
</P>
<P>
   White Hall Mayor John Jackson, another comrade of Al-Amin's
during the 1960s, said the Al-Amin he knew was not a violent man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known him to be peaceful,'' Jackson said. ``Now, I
hadn't seen him in a long time, but he never appeared to be
violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was an auxiliary police officer in White Hall. Jackson,
who issued the credentials, explained that such badges are given to
civilians who would then assist the town's small police force at
events such as parades or football games. The badges do not allow
auxiliary officers to carry guns or to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges in the warrants that the Fulton deputies tried
to serve on Al-Amin was impersonation of a police officer. He is
accused of using his Alabama auxiliary police badge in the incident
that led to the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson knew that Al-Amin, whom he still calls Rap Brown, had
run afoul of the law, including a 1973 conviction for armed robbery
in New York. However, he thought his friend had mellowed after
converting to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was on the scene Monday night when Al-Amin was arrested
near White Hall's town hall. ``It looked like he had changed his
life in the right direction. It was such a shock, because most
people around here knew him as quiet and smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin maintained his connections to the Lowndes County black
leaders whom he helped gain political office. Mostly, they said, he
stopped by for brief visits while he was going to or coming from
Selma, where he would usually stay overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, White Hall has changed little since the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is still little more than a country crossroads.
Clustered around the main intersection of the town's business
district are a supermarket, a bait and tackle shop, a gift shop and
the Bismillah Cafe. There is a small town hall and a branch library
in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks make up about three-fourths of the county's population of
about 13,000 residents, most of whom live below the poverty level.
The 1994 average household income for the county was $12,195, about
$5,500 less than the Alabama average.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White Hall Supermarket, employee Sharon Barefield
said she had seen Al-Amin several times, but she knew nothing of
his past life as Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he was in the Panther movement. He used to come
in here and just chit-chat, talk about nothing, then he would
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin had a connection to the people who ran the Bismillah
Cafe, which has been closed for the past four months. The manager
was Sahid Abdul Salaam, a friend of Al-Amin's. Salaam was the
leader of a small Muslim community in White Hall. He and several
relatives were taken in for questioning following Al-Amin's arrest;
but they were released Tuesday with no charges filed against them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a man named Sharif Al-Malik moved with his family
into the back of the restaurant. They planned to re-open it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Al-Malik said he spoke with Al-Amin about two weeks
ago, and they discussed preparing a celebration for area Muslims
who were returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking to me about slaughtering some goats for the
pilgrimage. He was asking me where we could get goats from,''
Al-Malik said.
</P>
<P>
   After the reports of the shooting in Atlanta, Al-Amin's friends
in White Hall were worried for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful they didn't kill him,'' Al-Malik said. ``I think
it was a witch hunt. They don't know who shot these police
officers. They put it on him, because they were serving the warrant
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other nationally known civil rights leaders who
passed through Lowndes County rarely, if ever, returned. Al-Amin
came back in peaceful times, and last week, when he was on the run
from the law.
</P>
<P>
   Amilcar Shabazz, a professor of American Studies at the
University of Alabama, said Al-Amin must have considered White Hall
a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think brother Al-Amin was trying to move into a direction
where he felt he could find safety and invisibility, until he could
figure out what his next move would be,'' Shabazz said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding out in Lowndes County made sense, given Al-Amin's
historical and philosophical connections to the region, said Rose
Gladney, a professor at the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``His philosophy is standing up to unjust authority,'' Gladney
said. Al-Amin may have come back to White Hall as a place to make
his last stand, she said. ``Sometimes, that's the thing you do,
rather than submit.''

DIVIDED JUSTICES RULE GOVERNMENT CANNOT REGULATE TOBACCO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled
that federal drug officials cannot control the manufacture or sale
of cigarettes, dealing a blow to President Clinton's effort to
regulate the product and handing a victory to the
multibillion-dollar tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the court called cigarettes the United
States' most deadly consumer good but said Congress had not given
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the legal authority to
regulate them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed disappointment with the court's
decision, which invalidated a host of FDA regulations aimed at
limiting teen-agers' access to cigarettes. He urged federal
lawmakers to take action in light of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to protect our children from the harms of tobacco,
Congress must now enact provisions of the FDA rule,'' Clinton said
in a statement from New Delhi, India. ``I believe that by working
together across party lines we can protect our children and save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But history is not on the president's side. Legislation to give
federal regulators authority over tobacco failed as recently as
1998, and a subsequent effort would appear to face a similar fate.
A leading Republican lawmaker rejected Clinton's call for
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I oppose legislation that would expand the bureaucratic reach
of the very agencies so intent on circumventing the role of
Congress on important matters of public policy,'' said House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``Of course, we must continue to
address the problems of youth smoking, and I applaud the efforts of
parents, teachers and others to discourage the illegal use of
tobacco products.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's ruling spared the largely unregulated tobacco
industry from the specter of FDA officials who would have had the
authority to ban cigarettes or at least limit the amount of
nicotine, a carcinogenic stimulant, permitted in the products.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law now imposes only minor demands on tobacco companies,
such as requiring them to put warning labels on their products and
encouraging retailers not to sell cigarettes to minors. States, by
contrast, have no authority to regulate the manufacture of
cigarettes but generally do prohibit retailers from selling them to
children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, retailers who sell tobacco to a minor face
fines of up to $500 for a first offense and up to $1,000 for
subsequent violations. Children convicted of using or possessing
tobacco may be required to take a tobacco-education course or pay
of fine of between $125 and $250. Teens who do not attend the
required course could have their driver's licenses suspended.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 FDA regulations, the agency's first ever effort to
control tobacco, would have prohibited the sale of cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco to anyone younger than 18, required retailers to
check the identification of would-be tobacco buyers younger than 27
and restricted vending-machine sales of cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco to adult-only locations. Enforcement of the now defunct
rules had been suspended pending the high court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Major cigarette makers Philip Morris and Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp., which challenged the FDA's authority, hailed the
court's ruling and offered to work with the federal government to
keep tobacco away from children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opposed the FDA rule because regulation of cigarettes as
(drugs) was inappropriate and could have led to prohibition,'' said
Philip Morris, whose cigarette brands include Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``But federal regulation of cigarettes as cigarettes, dealing
with youth smoking while respecting an adult's right to smoke,
makes sense for smokers and manufacturers alike,'' the New
York-based company added. ``We are ready and eager to engage in a
useful, positive discussion on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, Brown &AMP; Williamson and other tobacco companies
lobbied hard to defeat the 1998 legislation that would have given
the federal government broad power to regulate tobacco products and
prohibited advertising aimed at youngsters. The legislation, which
was defeated by massive opposition from conservative Senate
Republicans, also would have raised cigarette taxes by $1.10 per
pack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the past failure, Senate Democrats were quick to pick up
the president's call for tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility is now squarely on Congress to grant FDA
the authority it needs to regulate tobacco,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision has no effect on the Clinton
administration's pending multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the
industry, alleging that the companies defrauded the government by
withholding from until the 1990s what they knew in the 1950s to be
the truth of cigarettes' health hazards. The industry said it will
fight the lawsuit, arguing that the government knew of smoking's
dangers as far back as the early 1960s when lawmakers ordered
warning labels to be placed on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision also has no impact on the $206 billion
the industry agreed to pay 46 states in November 1998 to settle
their lawsuits seeking compensation for the costs of treating
residents with smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 people die annually in the United States from
tobacco-related illnesses, including cancer, respiratory problems
and heart disease. The death toll from tobacco is higher than that
from AIDS, car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs,
suicides and fires combined, according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also said that nearly 80 percent of the 400,000
smokers who die each year began smoking when they were children.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court said Congress, rather than giving FDA
tobacco authority, has in fact passed laws to protect the industry.
Citing the 1998 legislative failure, the court added that Congress
has expressly rejected legislation that called for FDA oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress, for better or for worse, has created a distinct
regulatory scheme for tobacco products, squarely rejected proposals
to give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco,and repeatedly acted to
preclude any agency from exercising significant policymaking
authority in the area,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the
court's majority option.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's decision were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp public sign of disagreement, Justice Stephen G.
Breyer took the extraordinary step of reading portions of his
dissent from the bench. Justices take this symbolic action only
when they have the most profound objection to the majority view.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer assailed his colleagues for carving out a cigarette
exception to the FDA's statutory authority to regulate drugs that
have profound effects on the human body. Breyer said cigarettes
should be subject to FDA regulation because their nicotine
component acts as a stimulant and appetite suppressant in the same
manner as do drugs that the agency oversees.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Breyer's dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens, David
H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II opened the first official visit by
a pope to Israel on Tuesday, declaring after he landed in Tel Aviv
that he felt ``deep emotion'' on setting foot ``in the land where
God chose to pitch his tent.'' Immediately on his arrival, he was
also given a taste of the fierce politics that are likely to vein
his long-awaited pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken Israeli president, Ezer Weizman, welcomed the pope
with a blunt, at times defensive speech that instantly bore into
one of the issues dividing the Vatican and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are arriving this evening in Jerusalem, the capital of the
State of Israel, the heart of the Jewish world, which is also a
holy site for Christianity and Islam,'' Weizman told the frail
79-year-old pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope listened, hunched under an umbrella beneath a light
drizzle in Tel Aviv, after a military band played ``Jerusalem of
Gold,'' a song that celebrates the return of Jewish holy sites
after the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is the city of eternity, a city that has been
reunified,'' Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most states, the Vatican has never recognized Jerusalem as
Israel's capital, and has argued that it should be granted
``internationally recognized'' status as a holy city. A top Vatican
diplomat recently angered Israeli officials by saying East
Jerusalem, the part of the city seized by Israel in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, was ``illegally occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli viewpoint was driven home even more directly Tuesday
night when the pope's helicopter arrived at a heliport in East
Jerusalem. Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, greeted him there,
saying ``Welcome to the eternal capital of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian legislature, watched the
helicopter's arrival on television, and said he was stunned and
appalled by Olmert's unscripted presence in East Jerusalem, whose
final status remains to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The pope arrived in Israel from Jordan, where Tuesday morning he
held a Mass for 40,000 people in Amman, and prayed on the eastern
bank of the Jordan River at Wadi al Kharrar, one of the sites held
to be the place where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   The import of John Paul's visit to Israel, the first by a pope
officially as a head of state, was underscored by the welcome he
received at Ben Gurion International Airport. He was greeted by
Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and several Cabinet ministers _
though no ultra-Orthodox government minister attended.
</P>
<P>
   A few rabbis joined a contingent of Muslim clerics and
representatives of all Christian faiths, including Greek Orthodox.
But neither of Israel's two chief rabbis was present. A Foreign
Ministry official said they were attending prayer services for the
eve of Purim, the holiday celebrating Jewish survival.
</P>
<P>
   Three children from Jesus' boyhood town of Nazareth _ one
Jewish, one Muslim and one Christian _ were on hand on the tarmac
as the pope arrived in a Jordanian Airlines jet, which was fitted
with Israeli and Vatican flags after landing. The pope's white
skullcap blew off in the strong wind, and he raised a trembling
hand in the air in a wave before kissing a pot of Israeli soil
offered by the children. When he finished his speech, delivered in
English, he saluted his hosts with the Hebrew word ``shalom,'' or
peace.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul showed no sign of being taken aback by Israeli
officials' public broaching of a sensitive political topic usually
left to diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
   He has long dreamed of leading a Holy Year pilgrimage to the
sites where Jesus lived and died. But in his remarks at the Tel
Aviv airport, he also raised a larger mission in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Weizman as a ``peacemaker,'' the pope said, ``We all
know how urgent is the need for peace and justice, not for Israel
alone but for the entire region.'' He said the world closely
followed ``the peace process which finds all the peoples of the
region involved in the difficult search for a lasting peace with
justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Weizman did not suggest that Israel needed help in resolving
territorial disputes. ``From the very outset, our hand has been
outstretched in peace to our Arab neighbors,'' he told the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope hopes to use his visit to Israel to promote interfaith
reconciliation and lend his moral authority to the quest for peace.
But his unique international stature is equally coveted by
Israelis, who want him to reinforce their sovereign rights, and by
Palestinians, who hope his visits to Palestinian leaders and a
Palestinian refugee camp on Wednesday will lend legitimacy to their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with Israel, however, is more complex, clouded
by Jewish memories of centuries of anti-Semitism and charges that
the Catholic Church failed to speak out sufficiently against the
Holocaust during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope Paul VI visited the Holy Land in 1964, he was
gratefully received by Israeli officials of the time, who welcomed
those early, pioneering efforts toward reconciliation between Jews
and Catholics. But few Israelis have forgotten that Pope Paul spent
only 12 hours in their country, and pointedly never referred to it
as Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and Israel established diplomatic relations in 1994.
The pope, who has on several occasions apologized for some
Catholics' failure to protect Jews during the Holocaust and
repeated that regret this month in a sweeping apology for the
historic sins of his church, wants to use his visit to heal
lingering wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, saying the Vatican's diplomatic recognition of
Israel ``set a seal on efforts to open an era of dialogue,'' the
pope urged continued progress. ``With new-found openness toward one
another, Christians and Jews together must make courageous efforts
to remove all forms of prejudice,'' he said Tuesday night. ``We
must strive always and everywhere to present the true face of the
Jews and Judaism, as likewise of Christians and Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, who mentioned the Holocaust twice in his remarks, said
he ``appreciated'' the pope's ``request for forgiveness for deeds
carried out in the past by representatives of the church against
the Jewish people.'' Saying he was mindful of how the church's
teaching has shifted to recognize ``the Jewish people as it defines
itself,'' the Israeli president said it was now ``important for the
men and women in the church to also become familiar with the modern
Israeli reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israel John Paul glimpsed Tuesday night is radically
different from the one he explored in 1963, when he went on a
pilgrimage there as a bishop from Cracow. In a letter he wrote to
fellow Polish bishops describing his trip, he focused on the
religious sites he toured, painstakingly describing shrines and
churches few of his colleagues in Communist Poland could visit
themselves. But the political strains of the time did not entirely
escape his notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Jerusalem is divided between Jews and Arabs, and the
Jews do not have access to the Wailing Wall,'' he wrote then. ``All
the temple area belongs to the Muslims.''

<P>
   When I was 9 years old, I was the founding editor, publisher,
circulation director and finance director for the Archer Lane
Scoop, in Lynnfield, Mass. It was your classic neighborhood
newsletter. My biggest scoop was interviewing a neighbor on the
one-year anniversary of her son's death by suffocation in a
snowbank. She wouldn't talk to me after that. I learned early on
what it was like to get doors slammed in your face.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to New York the day after I graduated from Trinity
College. I'm a Bostonian, and I hadn't spent much time in the city.
I moved in with a woman who I was working with and her husband.
They had a palatial Park Avenue apartment; I really lucked out. I
kept trying to move out, to places like Hell's Kitchen, but they
wouldn't let me. I stayed there for four months.
</P>
<P>
   I spent 21 years in the magazine publishing business. I'm a
great lover of print. But four years ago I had an epiphany: What
should I do with the rest of my life?
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard of DoubleClick, which places advertising and
tracks consumers' use of the Internet, I thought: ``I'm too old for
that stuff. I'm totally overdressed, and I don't want to work with
geeks.'' The first discussion we had, it was like speaking to
someone in a foreign language. I'm not even sure why we ever even
had a second meeting. I was the 14th employee.
</P>
<P>
   The first week after I came over, I must have got calls from 50
friends in traditional media worried that I had had a nervous
breakdown or was losing my mind. The hysterical thing is that
within a year, all 50 had called back and asked me for a job.
</P>
<P>
   I am a media junkie. This is what I eat for breakfast and snack
on at midnight. There hasn't been a new medium in 50 years, and the
Internet is beyond a medium _ it's a marketplace. So the idea of
being right smack in the middle of inventing a new medium, how much
better could it get?
</P>
<P>
   My children have always been involved in my career. The night I
brought home the DoubleClick offer, that was it. My 6-year-old
said, ``Oh, Mommy, I would be so proud if you got better on the
computer.'' My 8-year-old son said, ``Oh, man, do you know how cool
you'd be at school?''
</P>
<P>
   We have nine computers at home for four people. My kids
constantly amaze me, it's so intuitive for them. My daughter,
Leigh, just got a blueberry I-Mac. My son, Ben, wakes up in the
morning and says, ``I just put my mind into the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people fight about religion. My husband and I fight about
whether the kids are going to be raised Mac or PC. He's a creative,
a TV director, very quiet. We've been married for 16 years, and I
still think he's the nicest person in the whole world. But our
house is definitely full of large personalities.
</P>
<P>
   I took six weeks off with my first child and three weeks off
with my second. I have never not worked. It's always been part of
the deal. I got here first, and I invited them to join me.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, I was the first female publisher to take my
baby to the office. The idea of taking months off just wasn't an
option. It wasn't part of the executive suite as it often is now.
My son was at his first black-tie event when he was 3 weeks old; I
had him in one of those one-piece tuxedo suits.
</P>
<P>
   In my early 40s, I am working as hard as anyone in their early
20's can imagine working, even if they are a workaholic.
</P>
<P>
   I laugh a lot, and I'm an extremely people-oriented person. But
I am deadly serious about business. I don't sleep. I really resent
that sleeping isn't optional.

MOSCOW: from higher-ups.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a few experts view Putin's KGB heritage as a harbinger
of an authoritarian crackdown during his presidency. As prime
minister and later as acting president, he has imported to his
inner circle former KGB officials who are widely criticized by
human rights advocates, including a deputy FSB director widely
attacked for persecuting dissidents under Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   A penchant for order and centralized control seems one of the
few clear hallmarks of Putin's governing philosophy. Both as prime
minister and as acting president, he tightened the financial screws
on Russia's independent-minded regions. Some reports indicate that
the government is calling in overdue loans against regional
governments that have not fully toed the Kremlin line.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language newspaper Moscow Times, in this week's
edition, suggested that Putin's months atop the FSB gave him access
to enough compromising material to keep Russia's notoriously
corrupt governors in line for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also has beefed up the KGB presence in the military, where
spies have traditionally had the role of keeping tabs on dissident
factions and tamping down potential military resistance to
government policies.
</P>
<P>
   Former KGB officials also have a limited, though important role
in Kremlin affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what he's doing, not what he's saying, then
it's clear he's trying to surround himself with members of his KGB
team,'' said Nikolai Petrov, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace who is convinced that Russia under Putin is
headed for some softened form of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unfortunately, the majority of people in the country are
ready to give him almost all the achievements of democracy to get
stability, and security, and certain guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrov says the issue now is whether Putin's free-market, albeit
hands-on, style will prove better than the free-market-chaotic bent
of Yeltsin's years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Latsis, a leading political commentator with the daily
newspaper Novaya Izvestiya, agreed that the question boils down to
one of approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's apparent,'' he said, ``is that this is a
person who's competent. We always had problems with that, in the
Brezhnev era and in the Yeltsin era as well. They wanted to do
good, but they didn't know how. With Putin its clear he is
competent. He understands how.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he want to do good?
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Latsis sighed, ``is not apparent at this moment.''

   The cities of Boston, Bridgeport, Conn., Providence, R.I., San
Francisco and the state of Maryland are joining a growing coalition
of local and state governments nationwide that intends to use its
combined buying power to try to force gun manufacturers to follow
the lead of Smith &AMP; Wesson and accept last week's pact requiring
new handgun safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, along with
Detroit, Atlanta and Miami-Dade County, initiated the
preferred-buying effort on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta said Tuesday, is
simple: Now that Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's oldest and largest
maker of handguns, has settled lawsuits with 15 cities by agreeing
to the safety measures, the best way to persuade other companies to
go along is to intensify financial pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of government sales is impossible to ignore for any
gun manufacturer,'' Campbell said, noting that about a quarter of
all gun sales are made to law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, Albany, Rochester, Buffalo, Middletown and
Westchester County have indicated their intention to join the
drive, said Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   HUD also intends to ask the nation's 3,200 housing authorities
to adopt the buying policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers on Tuesday called the cities' buying campaign
illegal, saying that federal and state laws prevent tinkering with
the competitive bidding process.

WELLES' CHANCE TO MAKE TELEVISION DO HIS BIDDING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his insatiable need for the spotlight, not to mention
money, Orson Welles turned television into his deadliest
collaborator. Late in his life, television helped transform his
image from genius to Falstaffian buffoon, that mountainous figure
in a flowing black shirt trotted out to amuse Merv Griffin's
audiences and shill for Paul Masson wine.
</P>
<P>
   But there had been a moment when Welles' connection to
television might have taken a happier turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think television has lived up to its potential?''
Edward R. Murrow asked in a ``Person to Person'' interview in 1955,
looking at Welles on a giant screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't, Ed, no,'' Welles answered, in an early version of the
fake chumminess so common now in chats with Matt and Katie and
others. ``There are new forms that haven't even been attempted in
TV, and it's solidifying and crystallizing too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he attempted something adventurous on television,
and basically blew his opportunity. Welles wrote and directed ``The
Fountain of Youth,'' the pilot for an anthology series, and also
hogged the camera as onscreen narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely seen, it will be presented at the Museum of Television
and Radio along with the Murrow interview and a very funny 1956 ``I
Love Lucy'' episode with Welles as guest star. (The program begins
on Friday and runs through May 7 at the museum in New York and
through May 31 in Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``Lucy'' appearance led to a deal to make the pilot for
Desilu (the Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz production company), with
the idea that Welles would be creatively involved, somehow, in each
minidrama. But the series was never sold, and ``The Fountain of
Youth'' was shown two years later on NBC's ``Colgate Theater,'' a
summer grab bag of rejected pilots.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mere curiosity in Welles' career, but the museum's
package reveals a great deal about how television shaped his image
and how the medium really was ``crystallizing too quickly,'' as
Welles knew but did little to change.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some visual daring and an odd foreshadowing of ``The
Twilight Zone,'' ``The Fountain of Youth'' is a weird blend of
radio and theater, a strangely wrongheaded approach to television.
</P>
<P>
   As narrator, Welles is the egomaniacal center. ``Orson Welles
speaking,'' he begins, then appears on screen in a suit and bow tie
to tell the story, set in the 1920s, of what he calls a ``wacky
litle romance'' about a middle-aged scientist named Humphrey Baxter
who falls for a blonde showgirl, Caroline Coates.
</P>
<P>
   When Caroline dumps Humphrey for a dashing tennis pro who is her
equal in narcissism, the scientist offers the new couple the only
existing vial of a youth serum. The romance may not be as wacky as
Welles hoped (he based it on a short story by John Collier), but it
is playful, going for wry psychological wit rather than spookiness.
</P>
<P>
   Welles is no Rod Serling, popping up at the start and finish of
the tale. He moves on and off screen throughout the half hour,
telling the story (including characters' dialogue), as if he were
reading it, as if this were radio.
</P>
<P>
   Visual and dramatic flourishes were second nature to Welles by
then, and the pilot has many. Sometimes he wanders in front of
still photographs of the characters. At other times his narration
gives way to the drama, as if we were peeking in on a play. To
change one scene, Humphrey is cast into dark shadows and takes off
his coat; when the lights come up, we are in a nightclub instead of
on a dock.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual jazziness creates a jarring feel, as if Welles
were reading from a storybook in which the photographs occasionally
come to life. This is far from the fluid, pure cinema of ``Citizen
Kane'' (then 15 years in the past) and of the film Welles would
begin the next year, ``Touch of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, falling back on his radio days, he failed to grapple with
what television was about. Iconoclastic though it is, ``The
Fountain of Youth'' has the aura of a crumb that a genius tosses at
the masses; that never works.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Welles' career, of course, was that he was always
straddling the commercial and artistic worlds, and, after his first
great success, rarely conquering either. At the time of the
``Lucy'' show, he had been performing in Las Vegas, doing an act
that combined magic tricks with Shakespearean recitations.
</P>
<P>
   That was the image he projected on the show: playing himself, he
agrees to appear at Ricky's club and wants Lucy to assist in his
magic act; she thinks he wants her to do Shakespeare, playing
Juliet to his Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   Welles promotes and puts a spin on the image: he signs copies of
his new Shakespeare recording at Macy's; he soaks up Lucy's praise
and asks for more. Still, he is the straight man who lets her get
the laughs. She spots him in Macy's, where she happens to be trying
on scuba gear that makes her look as if rubber antennae are
sticking out of her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``My man-from-Mars broadcast was 18 years ago, what kept you?''
he says, slyly referring to his triumphant radio stunt, ``War of
the Worlds.'' That persona echoes in Welles' later television
appearances: looking back at a triumph while doing nightclub tricks
(or their equivalent, ``Merv Griffin'').
</P>
<P>
   Many warring facets of Welles' career are on display in this
shrewd little museum program: he is the interview subject who talks
big about television, and the creator of a casually misbegotten
pilot; most emphatically, he is the Orson Welles who played himself
on television, arriving with his bag of tricks.

RESTRAINT ON TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of Beijing's belligerent and foolish attempts to
intimidate voters on Taiwan, the victory of Chen Shui-bian in the
island's presidential election Sunday creates a security crisis for
the leaders of mainland China, Taiwan, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All three governments will have to act sagely, avoiding the
temptation to indulge in bravado. Difficult as it may be to place
the pragmatic need for restraint above a show of principle, this is
precisely what the current perilous situation calls for.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the communist rulers of Beijing will have to draw the
correct lessons from the folly of their meddling in Taiwan's
election. In 1996, the People's Liberation Army launched missiles
into the waters around Taiwan and conducted war games in a futile
effort to prevent the election of Taiwan-born President Lee
Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs of Mao only provoked President Clinton into sending
two naval carrier groups toward the Taiwan Strait and ensured Lee's
election. The lesson they learned from that loss of face was,
unfortunately, the wrong one. They thought that instead of firing
missiles toward Taiwan they could influence the island's choice by
making threats.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after his victory, Chen wisely proposed a political
dialogue with Beijing, offering to negotiate direct commercial and
postal links that would benefit both economies and expressing a
desire for harmony and cooperation. The difficulty for the
communists is that, having jettisoned Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
thought as the legitimizing basis for their rule, they have fallen
back on nationalistic chauvinism. The nationalist mission bestowed
on them by China's history is to complete the unification of the
motherland, and that means they must retrieve Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should remind Beijing and Taipei that they share a
profound interest in avoiding war. Beijing will have to forget its
bellicose preelection bluff and do nothing to jeopardize the
congressional vote that will enable China to enter the World Trade
Organization. Chen must assure the communists that Taiwan can go on
pretending not to be independent until the mainland also becomes
democratic.

SENATE FIGHT SNAGS AID BILL FOR KOSOVO AND COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $9 billion spending bill to help Colombia combat
drug traffickers and to pay for American military operations in
Kosovo is imperiled because of stiff opposition from Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, and fiscal conservatives in the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Tuesday that he did not oppose the Kosovo and Colombia
aid, but rather just the legislative vehicle for it. He said the
so-called emergency measure, which is $3.8 billion larger than
President Clinton had requested, had become a magnet for
pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting to be far too costly,'' Lott said, reiterating a
criticism that he has increasingly sounded for two weeks. ``I've
urged all along that if we were going to do a supplemental, it be
quick and clean. It's not quick, and it's not clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott wants the antidrug assistance, Kosovo spending and other
domestic aid in the bill, including flood relief to farmers in
North Carolina, to be considered in the regular appropriations
process this spring. That effort tends to prune extraneous
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the bill say it would delay urgent spending
needs until the start of the next fiscal year, on Oct. 1. The
Pentagon, for example, says it needs $2.8 billion by late April to
pay for unanticipated costs in Kosovo or the military will have to
cut flying hours, cancel training exercises and forgo maintenance,
jeopardizing military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats and Clinton administration officials seized on
Lott's new remarks and said his threat to bottle up the bill would
jeopardize foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irresponsible not to vote on a supplemental at a time
when we're browbeating the Europeans to do their share in Kosovo,''
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the
Foreign Relations Committee, said of the Kosovo item.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., speaking about the aid to Colombia,
said, ``Procrastination only increases the ultimate cost and
chances of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott is also at odds with House Republican leaders, namely
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who has made aid to Colombia a top
foreign policy goal. The House Appropriations Committee this month
approved $1.7 billion over two years to support Colombia's fragile
democracy and to help its military fight against drugs by reducing
cocaine and heroin production.
</P>
<P>
   The House package, which added $500 million to the
administration request for money for Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru,
includes 30 Blackhawk and 30 Huey helicopters for the Colombian
Army and police forces and $115.5 million for the national police.
The House measure includes $1.6 billion for the Pentagon to cover
unanticipated costs because of rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this supplemental has truly urgent content,'' said
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Lott are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to try to
iron out their differences. But even House leaders postponed a
floor vote on the spending until after the House had resolved a
battle on its budget plan for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker's intent is good, and I support drug interdiction,
but this needs a good airing,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who
has led a group of fiscal conservatives in opposing the spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has analyzed the bill, which he says is laced with
examples of spending that are not emergencies at all like $75
million for NASA programs and $16 million to speed environmental
cleanups in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout has spread to the Senate, where the Appropriations
Committee had been scheduled to vote on the spending bill this
week, but has postponed action until the House acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in for a real fight on the supplemental,'' said Sen.
Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore. ``It's so open ended and such a large
number.''

FDA NOT A REGULATOR OF TOBACCO, HIGH COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major defeat for both the Clinton
administration and antismoking groups, the Supreme Court said
Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration does not have the
right to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said the agency was caught in an unwinnable
Catch-22: The FDA wants to limit the sale and marketing of tobacco
to reduce smoking, especially among children. But if tobacco is as
deadly and addictive as the government contends, the Supreme Court
said, the FDA would have no choice but to ban tobacco entirely,
making the issue of regulation moot.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling throws out a series of rules the FDA issued in
1996 making it harder for minors to purchase tobacco illegally and
prohibiting tobacco companies from marketing to children and
teenagers. Many states, including Massachusetts, have laws on
selling cigarettes to minors that are not affected by the high
court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
acknowledged that tobacco ``poses perhaps the single most
significant threat to public health in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the FDA had not proved it had the legal authority
to restrict the sale and marketing of tobacco, ``no matter how
important, conspicuous and controversial the issue, and regardless
of how likely the public is to hold the Executive Branch
politically accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry celebrated the ruling while antismoking
advocates in Congress vowed to pass legislation giving the FDA the
authority to control tobacco, a substance the government says kills
400,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tuesday's) ruling is a setback,'' said Matthew Myers of the
National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids. ``But we think it's equally
significant in that the Supreme Court has said that tobacco is the
most serious public health hazard that faces our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a big win for the tobacco industry, which has
been hit with costly lawsuits and aggressive efforts by the federal
and state governments to control how and where the companies can
sell their product. In a negotiated settlement in 1998, the
industry agreed to pay $246 billion to 46 states, which sued to
recover the public health costs of tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's opinion were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were justices Stephen G. Breyer, John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Writing for the four,
Breyer said the 1938 federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's ``basic
purpose _ the protection of public health _ supports the inclusion
of cigarettes within its scope.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing the case decided Tuesday, the tobacco industry did
not try to convince the high court that tobacco is healthful.
Instead, the industry's lawyers said the FDA _ charged with
determining whether drugs, food, and medical devices are ``safe and
effective'' _ had no business regulating the sale and marketing of
a substance the agency believes is deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to argue that these products are safe,'' said
Charles Blixt, executive vice president and general counsel for the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. But if the FDA were to get involved in
regulating tobacco, he said, it would have to ban it, a politically
and financially explosive idea that neither side of the debate
believes is feasible, given the nation's long history with tobacco
growing and use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in Congress intended that an unelected
bureaucrat should make the decision to ban cigarettes,'' Blixt
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in India, called on Congress to
pass the Frist-McCain bill, which would impose many of the rules
the FDA issued in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to protect our children from the harms of tobacco,
Congress must now enact the provisions of the FDA rule,'' Clinton
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate came close to passing a sweeping tobacco control bill
in 1998, which included a provision allowing the FDA explicitly to
control tobacco. But the measure was filibustered by the
Republican-led chamber, and the Senate failed by two votes to stop
the filibuster, so the bill died.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the FDA element of the bill was the least
controversial part of the measure, tobacco-control advocates
believe it could pass as a stand-alone bill. ``The solid groundwork
for legislation has already been laid,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, a leader on antismoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said he
does not support giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. ``I
don't think they do a very good job with what they're doing,'' he
said Tuesday. House majority leader Dick Armey of Texas, said,
``I'm not anxious to extend the power and authority to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry officials said they were ready to accept some
restrictions on the sale and marketing of cigarettes. What makes
the industry nervous is the government's insistence that tobacco is
an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a product that has a known and inherent risk to it,''
Blixt said. But ``I don't agree that cigarettes are drugs,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies are already operating under a series of
restrictions meant to curtail sales to minors, said Mark Berlind,
senior assistant general counsel for Philip Morris. ``We certainly
don't think cigarettes should be marketed to children,'' he said,
adding that the industry has no problem supporting laws meant to
ensure tobacco is not sold to minors.
</P>
<P>
   But smoking foes point out that 3,000 youngsters begin smoking
every day, and a good portion of them will continue to smoke. Young
people are now being tempted with ``bidi'' cigarettes, which look
like marijuana joints and come in vanilla and strawberry flavors,
said John Banzhof, a law professor at George Washington University
and the executive vice president of the Washington-based Action on
Smoking and Health.
</P>
<P>
   The flavored cigarettes ``are training wheels for kid smokers,''
Banzhof said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts last year adopted the disputed FDA rules into its
consumer protection law. The regulations require persons under 27
to show identification before buying tobacco, demand that vendors
keep tobacco products behind the counter, and limit advertising of
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are facing a court challenge, although the legal
issues are different than the ones considered in Tuesday's ruling,
said Gregory Connolly, director of the Department of Public
Health's tobacco control program. The state won in a lower federal
court, and the matter is now under appeal by the tobacco industry,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other states are taking a close look now'' at incorporating
the rules into their consumer and public health statutes, Connolly
said. ``We believe in states' rights.''

<P>
   The scene in the opening episode of ABC's ``Wonderland'' is
harrowing. A pregnant doctor in the emergency room of a hospital
patterned after the forensic psychiatric unit of New York's
Bellevue intervenes when a violently unhinged patient tries to harm
himself with a syringe. In the scuffle that follows, the syringe
pierces the doctor's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a powerful scene,'' said Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the
ABC Television Entertainment Group. ``Like any series that pushes
the envelope _ and this one clearly does _ there may be some people
who will find the show too intense. But we repeatedly talk at the
network about how important it is to take risks with programming.
Without question, this show represents a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk, of course, is that a drama about psychiatric patients
and their doctors will prove simply too unsettling to network
audiences accustomed to sitcom humor and twentysomething angst.
Compounding the difficulties for ``Wonderland'' _ it was actually
called ``Bellevue'' before legal concerns prompted the name change
_ is that the series, which starts on Thursday, will be pitted
against NBC's enduring medical drama, ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ABC and the creator of the show, Peter Berg, a film and
television actor who spent three seasons as a hockey-playing
surgeon on ``Chicago Hope,'' are convinced that the provocative
nature of the show will rivet viewers unaccustomed to such
intensity. Then again, are television audiences ready to spend an
hour each week with the criminally insane?
</P>
<P>
   The show has attracted attention at the top level of ABC. Berg
recalled that at a personal low point, when he was sure that the
network was going to scuttle the show, he was working late in a New
York hotel room where he goes to write and escape phones and family
distractions. The phone rang, and a woman's voice announced that
Michael Eisner was calling.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, thinking it was a friend needling him, shouted an
expletive and hung up. Minutes later, the phone rang again, and a
man's voice said sternly: ``Don't hang up! This is Michael
Eisner.'' Eisner is chairman of Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the most productive conversation with him about the show
in terms of its strengths and weaknesses,'' Berg said. ``Eisner has
been tremendously supportive. He said he felt that America was not
ready to sit down with a show that was entirely about the mentally
ill, and if we added an emergency room set with an emergency room
physician, we would have some sort of portal that felt familiar to
an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' is set in the psychiatric and emergency rooms of
a fictional New York hospital called Rivervue. (It was filmed
mostly in an abandoned building at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in
Queens.) The series deals specifically with forensic psychiatry _
that is, the treatment of mental patients who have committed
crimes. For this, Berg had the cooperation of Dr. Robert H. Berger,
director of Bellevue's Forensic Psychiatry Service, and Dr.
Alexander Sasha Bardey, a clinical and forensic psychiatrist at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who is 37, said the idea for the show had been tugging at
him for years. When he was a teenager, growing up in Chappaqua,
N.Y., his mother, Sally Berg, a homemaker, began doing volunteer
work in a psychiatric hospital in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched her transform herself from a suburban housewife to a
volunteer psychiatrist _ and she was exhilarated,'' said Berg, who
lives in New York with his wife, Elizabeth Rogers, a public
relations executive for Calvin Klein, and their 4-month-old son,
Emmett. ``She came home with daily reports about the patients, the
staff, the issues. And it had some kind of imprint on my
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, while Berg was performing in ``Chicago Hope,'' he
saw the Frederick Wiseman documentary ``Titicut Follies,'' about a
state prison for the criminally insane. ``I was sort of shocked,
horrified and intrigued at the same time,'' he said. At a meeting
with Imagine Television, Berg proposed a show about a psychiatic
hospital. ``I couldn't recall it ever having been done _ especially
in a way that was realistic and honest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue was selected because of its preeminent reputation, and
Berg spent nearly seven months at the forensic psychiatric unit
observing and taking notes. But getting into Bellevue was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Berger had been extremely reluctant to allow Berg to,
essentially, hang around. Screenwriters and novelists who had made
similar requests in the past were granted only a brief tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter told me he wanted to present to the public what mental
illness really is and not to whitewash it in any way,'' Berger
said. ``He impressed me. He was geniune. And he hasn't proven me
wrong yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bardey said that depictions of mental hospitals in films are
generally inept. ``People have a very, very two-dimensional notion
of what mental illness is,'' he said. ``The depictions are often
way out there _ like cartoons. Very rarely is individual pathology
made accessible.''

NET TAX COMMISSION FAILS TO REACH `SUPERMAJORITY' CONSENSUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ANDREA AHLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The congressional commission on Internet taxation
failed to reach a compromise in its final meeting on Tuesday,
instead sending Congress a report that does not have the support of
a two-thirds ``supermajority'' of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The report will include a proposal put forth by business members
of the commission to continue the existing moratorium on Internet
taxes for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Commission for Electronic Commerce, which met in
Dallas for the past two days, left the door open to continue
discussions towards a consensus proposal and might vote on any
compromises in a teleconference that will be held in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's chairman, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, said
it is ``very unlikely'' that there will be any new developments by
April 21, when the commission submits its report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can't get a consensus,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission _ 19 commissioners including business executives
and federal, state and local government officials _ had convened to
vote on taxation proposals it would submit in its congressional
report. In order for a proposal to be included as a recommendation
to Congress, the proposal needed to be backed by a 13-vote
``supermajority.''
</P>
<P>
   Several commissioners said they were disappointed that they
could not reach a consensus after late-night and early-morning
backroom meetings in Dallas this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating when you come so close to reach an
impasse,'' said commissioner David Pottruck, president and chief
executive of Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report will include two recommendations that
received a supermajority vote. The commissioners agreed that
Congress should pay attention to privacy implications of Internet
taxation, and that Congress should enact legislation to make
Internet access and personal computers widely available to the
public, particularly lower-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The report also will include the proposal put forth by the
industry leaders on the commission, which received a majority vote
on Monday but not two-thirds support. That proposal advocates a
five-year extension of the current moratorium on any new Internet
taxes, and simplifying the current sales tax system with uniform
tax forms and one tax rate per state.
</P>
<P>
   The business executives' proposal was not supported by some of
the state and local government officials on the commission, because
it too clearly defined which Internet sellers must charge sales
taxes and exempted certain Internet goods and services from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Remote sellers _ such as online or catalog retailers _ must
charge a state sales tax only if they have a physical presence,
such as corporate offices or distribution warehouses, in that
particular state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amazon.com does not have to charge its Texas
customers sales tax, because it has no offices or warehouses in
Texas. But Amazon.com does have to charge sales tax to its
Washington customers, because it has several offices in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise talks between the business executive commissioners
and the government commissioners fell apart when the two sides
could not agree on the definition of physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, they were not willing to compromise at all,'' said
Commissioner Dean Andal, chairman of the California Board of
Equalization.
</P>
<P>
   Four proposed clarifications on the definition of physical
presence said municipalities should not be able to tax remote
sellers if:
</P>
<P>
   _The seller's customer is located in that state.
</P>
<P>
   _A seller has an agreement with another company that has a
physical presence in that state.
</P>
<P>
   _Repair or warranty services on products sold by the remote
seller cannot be taxed if the seller does not have a physical
presence in that state.
</P>
<P>
   _An agreement between a seller and another business in that
state that allows a consumer to return products to a physical
location in that state.
</P>
<P>
   By preventing municipalities from taxing on those goods and
services, government officials said it would create an unlevel
playing field for traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. The
proposal is ``loaded full of special favors'' benefiting the
business leaders on the commission, commissioner and Dallas Mayor
Ron Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt said the provisions in the business
caucus proposal would affect $20 billion to $25 billion in state
and local taxes per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the (provisions) would say anything on the Internet
won't be taxed, and you'd find Internet registers in every store,''
Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he and the other commissioners agreed with the
business proposal on all other points.
</P>
<P>
   Several commissioners criticized the three federal government
representatives on the commission, accusing them of preventing a
possible two-thirds majority-backing on any proposal by abstaining
from voting.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials said the Clinton administration had
hoped the commission would reach a consensus, but is pleased that
the commissioners agree on several key issues such as the
simplification of the tax system and the repeal of the 3 percent
federal excise tax on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything we can to narrow those differences,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said.

 UNDATED: made accessible.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the patients in the series were inspired by the kinds of
people Berg saw at Bellevue _ although he and the psychiatrists,
who have seen several episodes, said there were no breaches of
confidentiality. Patients in the opening show range from a Wall
Street broker who had tried to kill himself to a young man who bit
off his mother's thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that the story lines are realistic, but that
situations are sometimes unrealistically condensed because of time
strictures.
</P>
<P>
   As would be expected, the plots also involve the personal lives
of the doctors. One of them is fighting for custody of his small
sons; another is struggling with single parenthood. A third is a
womanizer, inside and outside the hospital. ( Berg said that ABC
raised more objections to a brief but steamy sex scene between the
doctor and a girlfriend in the opening episode than to the violent
behavior of the patients.)
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who does not act in the new show, made his feature film
writing and directing debut in 1998 with ``Very Bad Things,'' a
violent comedy with Cameron Diaz and Christian Slater. Casting
``Wonderland'' presented an unusual hazard, Berg said. It seems
that many of the actors who sought roles as patients had seen
Dustin Hoffman in ``Rain Man'' way too many times.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, many of those who were selected, often from
the New York stage, knew something about mental illness because,
through friends or family members, they had been touched by it.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Martin Donovan (``The Opposite of Sex''),
whose character is based loosely on Berger. Donovan said that
everyone on the show understood the pitfalls of turning it into
something overwrought and not truthful, of turning the patients
into monsters. ``There's no moralizing here,'' he said. ``These
doctors have tremendous compassion for the patients and passion for
the work. Their job is to get at what makes these people tick and
what has gone wrong _ is it chemical, is it treatable, how severe
is it, are they, in fact, ill or faking it?''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who has worked at Bellevue for 23 years, owns up to
being stirred by the show. ``Every time I see the pilot, I don't
know, it sounds corny, but I get chills when, after the patient has
been so obstructionist and agitated and against treatment, I hear
him say, `I've got this problem; you think you can help me?' I feel
like hugging him.'' Berg, the actors and producers are, not
surprisingly, apprehensive about facing ``E.R.'' One reason for the
unenviable time slot is that ABC's schedule revolves around the
ever-present ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' and only a handful
of hours are available. And, for their part, the producers are
convinced that ``E.R.'' may be getting a little tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a difficult time slot for us, but so many people
say they don't watch `E.R.' anymore,'' said Tony Krantz, the chief
executive of Imagine Television, which is producing the show along
with Touchstone Television. ``These people who watched `E.R.' might
be interested in checking the 21st-century version of a medical
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that nearly every ``Wonderland'' episode presented to
ABC executives has provoked friction with the network. ``We keep
getting calls saying, `it's just too intense, too disturbing, can
you take the edge off?' Every show. `Tone this down. Ease back.
Don't let this patient get too upset.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Berg has few complaints. ``It's an odd
marriage,'' he said. ``Walt Disney and a show about the insane: we
aren't necessarily the most obvious of bedfellows.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun, at ABC, put it another way: ``We feel we have a unique
program _ very fresh and very risky. Are there concerns? Yes. Are
we proud of it? Yes.''

INDIA, US SIGN MULTIFACETED PACT

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ After a half century of misunderstanding and
mistrust, the United States and India Tuesday signed an agreement
hailed as a historic and overdue beginning of a strategic,
economic, and scientific partnership between the world's most
powerful democracy and its most populous one.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was overshadowed, however, by an overnight
massacre of at least 35 members of the minority Sikh religion in
the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, a Himalayan territory
claimed by both India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu majority nation of India has long blamed Kashmir's
problems on state-sponsored terrorism by the Muslim state of
Pakistan. Pakistan Tuesday decried the latest attack and denied any
links to it. Shortly after the statement was signed, news emerged
of a grenade and rocket attack Tuesday on five security officials
in Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal Monday night massacre of Sikhs _ the first targeting
of a minority community in a decade-long Muslim insurgency that has
claimed as many as 25,000 lives _ focused attention on a tinderbox
region that sparked two of India and Pakistan's three wars. The
simmering conflict escalated last summer with incursions into
Indian-held Kashmir from bases in Pakistan, nearly provoking
another war between the nuclear powers. President Clinton recently
called this ``the most dangerous place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
assured Clinton ``there is no threat of any war. India is committed
to peaceful means.'' But Vajpayee added that ``we have the means
and the will to eliminate this menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denounced the killings of civilians in Kashmir, and
called for an end to armed hostilities; mutual respect of a
UN-established boundary that divides Kashmir; a renewal of talks,
and a recognition by both sides that there can be no military
solution to the territorial dispute. He also said he would convey
that message to Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf _
the man seen as the architect of Pakistan's apparent escalation of
hostilities in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' statements came hours after Clinton was treated
to a 21-gun salute, with two dozen turbaned cavalry officers
parading on horseback in the shadow of the sun-baked, sandstone
domes of India's presidential palace. Clinton and his daughter
Chelsea also visited the simple, black marble memorial for Mohandas
K. Gandhi, the father of India's independence movement. The two
walked to the memorial hand-in-hand and barefoot as a sign of
respect, silently laying a wreath of white flowers and scattering
rose petals on the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Indian hosts have given the capital a facelift for his
visit, sandblasting entire neighborhoods of Delhi's notorious
grime, repainting streets, and decorating traffic circles with
planted flowers and garlands of marigolds, the most auspicious
flower for India. Long-dry fountains have been turned on, and
beggars and cows who wander the streets of major Indian cities
freely have been rounded up and tucked out of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton needs to keep coming back now so we can keep enjoying
this new city,'' joked Kabir Sandhu, 32, a chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's and Vajpayee's statement established regular bilateral
summits, dialogue on security and non-proliferation, joint
counter-terrorism efforts, commercial, trade and economic dialogue,
and a science and technology forum.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came on the first day of the first visit in 22 years by
a US president, exceeding India's expectations of what could be
accomplished in a short visit by the leader of the world's only
superpower _ a nation that New Delhi feels has unfairly given
India's giant democracy short shrift in favor of Pakistan, its
neighbor who has spent half its history under military rule.
</P>
<P>
   The apprehension between the two sides is a legacy of the Cold
War, an era when India headed the non-aligned nations movement and
refused to take sides with Washington, which began aiding Pakistan
as a buffer against communism. India, socialist in its economic
planning and unable to forge economic ties with Washington without
strategic ones, tilted toward Moscow for trade and aid.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, this visit is a chance to start again. India
wants recognition as an important player on the world stage, and to
a chance to convey security concerns over Pakistan and China, with
whom India has fought four border wars since 1947. The United
States wants restraint and non-proliferation by the world's two
newest nuclear powers in New Delhi and Islamabad; peaceful
resolution of Kashmir; and deals with the fast-growing economy with
one of the world's largest middle-classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have neglected this relationship for more than two
decades,'' Clinton said. ``It is too important to ever fall into
disrepair again.''
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi hoped the visit would ``signal India's coming of age
in international politics as a player of some strength, and as a
possible ally for the US in securing the stability of Asia if there
are problems with China,'' said Amitabh Mattoo, a political
scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. ``That has
been accomplished today. In terms of signals and institutional
messages, it's been a very good trip already.''
</P>
<P>
   US administration officials acknowledged no concrete progress
had been made on getting India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. Some Indian analysts said Clinton had tacitly acknowledged
India's need for a minimum credible nuclear deterrent _ a
conclusion Washington officially denies. Vajpayee meanwhile vowed
``a firm committment not to conduct further nuclear tests, not to
engage in a nuclear arms race, and not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons against any country.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the ancient Romans, glass was magical, a commodity
with star potential that was never fully realized by the Greeks.
Awed by the transparency and fragility of glass, the Romans in the
reign of Augustus (27 B.C. to A.D. 14) transformed its production
from a craft to an industry. And the process spanned several
decades, about as long it took to develop the computer in the late
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 65 B.C., glass was a rarity that dazzled the ancients,''
said Stuart Fleming, the scientific director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. ``But until that year there
wasn't a Latin word for it. That's when Lucretius described glass
in `On the Nature of Things' as colorful and shining and called it
vitrum.''
</P>
<P>
   A century later, innovative techniques, like glass blowing, had
changed the look of glass, and mass production had spread its
availability to 54 million Romans throughout the empire, which by
then extended north to Germany, south to Egypt, east to Iraq and
west to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Glass had become so common and cheap that its luster as a luxury
material began to dim for Roman aristocrats. To show their disdain,
they used the phrase ``vitera fracta,'' or broken glass, to mean
rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   While the elite no longer displayed glass objects among their
gold, silver and bronze table decorations, most Romans continued to
use glass in their homes and taverns, spurring inventive design and
fashion changes well into the sixth century.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning variety of glass objects in daily use at the time
incorporated virtually every glass-working technique known today,
as can be seen in ``Roman Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change,''
an exhibition at the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the
Decorative Arts, in Manhattan, through June 11. The 200 pieces date
from the first century B.C. to the sixth century A.D. and were
selected from the university museum's collection by Fleming, the
show's curator. It is the first exhibition of the museum's
collection of ancient glass since the museum opened a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   What amazed Fleming, a radiation physicist, when he first
examined the museum's glass collection was the thinness and
feather-lightness of so many pieces, especially those made to hold
the precious perfumes and cosmetics that Romans viewed as
necessities. Such pieces were small enough for a slave to hold in
the palm of her hand while she lined her mistress's eyes with kohl
and brightened her cheeks with rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Many pieces glow with vibrant lusters and speckling that
glassmakers did not plan: patinas left by time, soil and the
chemicals in the air that clouded the surfaces of ancient works.
But for the most part the pieces in this collection have
astonishing clarity and unmarred bodies that reveal ribbing,
dimpling, puckering and wavy patterns. These decorative effects
were pressed or combed into the glass while it was still soft, or
applied later after it had hardened, as is seen in a small jug with
zigzag tracing at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's favorite is a glittering blue bubble of a perfume
bottle from the first century A.D. that resembles a Christmas
ornament. It is mighty in its delicacy, a tiny form defined by a
trickle of white frosting spun in a spiral from its mouth to the
tip of its tail. And it was, no doubt, made by a slave _ as most
glass workers in the period were slaves _ who would have risked a
lot to create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody took the time to very carefully stretch out the neck
and stretch out the tail,'' Fleming said. ``If you broke an object
in a Roman workshop, you probably paid for it with a lashing.''
</P>
<P>
   This glorious piece reveals how the most distinctive
characteristic of glass, its transparency, was fully exploited
right at the beginning of the industrialization of glassmaking. The
piece was made soon after glass blowing was invented under the
Romans, probably in Judea, about 70 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Step by step, glass became ever more fanciful and decorative as
innovations enhanced the process. Glass was first blown in an open
mold to create, for example, square-sided bottles about A.D. 45.
Then under Nero came colorless glass, a staple still popular with
wine lovers, followed by faceting and lathe cutting to produce
glass objects that imitated rock crystal.
</P>
<P>
   Engraving was introduced by the second century A.D., and by the
fourth century there were cage cups: bowls carved with multiple
layers of decoration as if cut from rocks, the ultimate for glass
in technical virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion brought many changes to the forms and look of glass
during the Roman period. After Constantine converted to
Christianity in 318 A.D. and moved from Rome to the East, settling
in the city that became Constantinople, Roman glass began to look
increasingly more Byzantine.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sudden proliferation in production of glass lamps _
like those in cone shapes in the exhibition,'' Fleming said.
``Millions were produced to light the churches.'' Glass producers
also brought color back to glass: bright yellows, turquoise blues
and white. And the scenes from pagan myths, of Hercules or Eros,
for example, were altered slightly to depict Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman pottery and iron objects seem mundane to us today,''
Fleming said. ``And the symbolisms expressed in the Roman gold,
bronze and silver works which were coveted by the wealthy now seem
empty. But glass brings us most closely in touch with ancient
times: we can feel comfortable with it in everyday life, just as
the Romans did. We can imagine people using it and breaking it and
admiring it for its sheer beauty.''

INDIAN LEADER CHASTISES CLINTON OVER NUCLEAR COMMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Despite new ethnic slaughter in Kashmir and
India's refusal to make significant concessions in its nuclear
weapons program, India's head of state sternly took President
Clinton to task Tuesday night for repeatedly calling South Asia
``the most dangerous place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner he hosted in honor of the visiting U.S. leader,
Indian President K.R. Narayanan took the diplomatically unusual
step of drawing a bead on some of his guest's recent comments and
blasting away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been suggested that the Indian subcontinent is the most
dangerous place in the world and that Kashmir is a nuclear flash
point,'' Narayanan said. ``These alarmist descriptions will only
encourage those who want to break the peace and indulge in terror
and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not reply directly or immediately. A senior
administration official, arguing that Indian leaders resent
official U.S. commentary on their regional disputes, said later:
``It doesn't faze us.''
</P>
<P>
   Narayanan referred to public comments by Clinton made in
Washington in February and earlier this month. On March 9, Clinton,
addressing representatives of the U.S. religious community, spoke
of ethnic and religious conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous place in the world today, I think you could
argue, is the Indian subcontinent and the line of control in
Kashmir,'' Clinton said, basically repeating a sentiment he
expressed at the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Narayanan's caustic comments in what was called the
banquet's ``toast,'' Clinton saw his description brutally borne
out. The opening of his state visit was marred by a bloody eruption
in the Kashmir dispute and India's intransigence on nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton, the first U.S. president to visit India in 22
years, hailed ``a day of new beginnings'' in relations between the
world's two most populous democracies, he had to pause to condemn
the massacre of 40 Sikh men Monday night in the Indian-held region
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainous enclave is claimed by India and Pakistan and has
sparked two rounds of open warfare between the regional powers
since their independence from Britain. The line of control, of
which Clinton spoke, is basically the Indian-Pakistani cease-fire
from a 1971 accord that momentarily tamped down the sectarian
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence must end,'' Clinton said during a joint news
conference with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ``This
should be a time for restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who will visit Pakistan briefly Saturday at the end of
his weeklong trip to South Asia, called for ``renewed lines of
communication'' between the two nations. The two sides have not
held talks on Kashmir in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   India said it ``has the evidence'' that the killings were the
work of two militant Islamic groups, one of which is based in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, leader of a Hindu nationalist government, said the
``brutal massacre'' was ``further evidence of the ethnic cleansing
that has been under way for a decade.'' He said it was laughable to
cloak ``ethnic terrorism in the guise of jihad,'' the Islamic
notion of holy war.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and separatist leaders in Kashmir condemned the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abdul Rashid of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, in a
telephone interview from Kashmir, said the killings were ``a
planned attack to divert the attention'' of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to gain from such massacres,'' Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst suggested that the killings possibly point
to Pakistan losing whatever control it may have had over the
Islamic militants in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to say that the (Pakistani intelligence agency) is the
tail that wags the dog,'' said Rear Admiral Uday Bhaskar, deputy
director of the independent Institute for Defense Studies. ``But I
think we've reached a point where the tail has been severed from
the dog and these militant groups are acting of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the assault in Kashmir and India's steadfast
refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons program dominated a
Clinton-Vajpayee news conference following the leaders' meeting at
Hyderabad House.
</P>
<P>
   At the daytime news conference, Vajpayee offered a less direct
criticism of the U.S. view that India and Pakistan could be edging
toward open conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no threat of any war,'' Vajpayee said. ``We do not
think in terms of war, and nobody should think in those terms in
the subcontinent.'' But the prime minister, speaking of what he
views as Pakistani-inspired violence in Kashmir, said: ``We have
the means and the will to eliminate this menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to speak to the Indian Parliament, where leftists
may seek to disrupt Clinton's speech or walk out. As Clinton and
Vajpayee started their talks, about 2,000 members of left-wing
political parties marched on New Delhi's American Center.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Clinton, in
speaking to Indian lawmakers, would praise the nation's spirited
democracy and call for greater trade and development.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear issue, in the background in subcontinental relations
for years, emerged into the headlines in May 1998. First India and
then Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons tests, explicitly conceding
their membership in an exclusive international club.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee sought to cloak his pro-arms position in the most
soothing language, but the bottom line was unmistakable: India
feels compelled ``to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said he reaffirmed to Clinton his nation's
commitment not to conduct additional nuclear tests as well as to
eschew an arms race or first use of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright, in a speech in Washington before the trip,
said the United States would not accept the nuclear status quo, the
two nations' widely differing views were enshrined in a ``vision''
statement signed by Clinton and Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   The document said that although the two nations share the
ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament, ``we have not always agreed
on how to reach this common goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States believes India should forgo nuclear
weapons,'' the statement said. ``India believes that it needs to
maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with its
own assessment of its security needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton even took the step of lifting an economic sanction
invoked against India two years following its nuclear test. Clinton
allowed resumption of a U.S.-funded project to help reform India's
financial markets, a program valued at $25 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference, Clinton called for renewal of
Indian-Pakistani contacts, but said: ``You cannot expect a dialogue
to go forward unless there is an absence of violence and a respect
for the line of control.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech to Parliament, Clinton begins a three-day tour
that combines sightseeing and meetings with a cross section of
Indian society. He was to fly from New Delhi to Agra for his first
look at the Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, visited the site of the
cremation of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the spiritual leader of modern
India, scattering rose petals over the flower-decked black marble
memorial.

POPE VIEWS SITE JORDAN CLAIMS IS THAT OF JESUS' BAPTISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With POPE-HOLYLAND)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WADI AL KHARRAR, Jordan _ Pope John Paul II on Tuesday visited a
desolate wind-swept plain here near the Jordan River, a site where
Jordan claims Jesus was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians took the pope's visit here as a coup, giving
something of a seal of approval to their site. ``This is a
confirmation of the baptismal site,'' said Akel Bitalji, the
minister of tourism and antiquities. ``This is the authentic
site.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday the pope, at the behest of Yasser Arafat, is
also making a brief stop at a site that also claims to be the
baptismal site _ in the West Bank, directly across the Jordan
River. Israeli officials are upgrading that site, after long
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by sandy gusts of wind, the pope stood under the arch
of a restored Byzantine church as he conducted the ceremony.
Invoking the scriptural depiction of John the Baptist as ``a voice
crying in the wilderness,'' he said, ``Here at the River Jordan, I
too lift up my heart in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit here, along with an earlier Mass attended by
nearly 40,000 people at Amman's municipal stadium, provided a shot
in the arm for Jordan's tiny Christian community _ less than 5
percent of the country's population, which is overwhelmingly
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Jordan people don't even talk about Christianity,''
said Najwa Ghannoum, 27. ``But with the pope here, they talk about
us on television, and that is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the stadium, ecstatic followers, many of whom arrived in the
early hours, mobbed the pope's car as it slowly circled the stadium
track and as he waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Israeli-controlled site, the Jordanian site was
neglected during years of conflict; it was a mine-filled military
frontier where tanks were positioned. After the signing of the
Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty in 1994 and the redeployment of
Jordanian forces along the border, the area was surveyed by
archaeologists, excavated and partly restored.
</P>
<P>
   Situated at a spring-fed tributary of the Jordan near a hill
venerated in Christian tradition as the site of the prophet's
Elijah's fiery ascent to heaven, Wadi al Kharrar was the site of
several Byzantine churches commemorating the baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The partly restored remains of two churches and a monastery, as
well as a mosaic floor and baptismal pools from the Roman period,
are visible at the site today.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries of pottery shards, coins and oil lamps from the
first century, along with subsequent travelers' accounts of
churches and baptismal shrines, all indicate that it was the
trans-Jordanian Bethany in the wilderness where John the Baptist
lived, Dr. Muhammad Waheeb, the archaeologist in charge of the
project, said.

GOLDMAN SACHS REPORTS SURGE IN REVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group, the big investment banking firm, reported
Tuesday that a surge in revenue from trading stocks, bonds, oil and
other commodities pushed its first-quarter net income to $887
million, or $1.76 a diluted share, easily surpassing analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings, for the three months through Feb. 25, were 67
percent higher than the $532 million Goldman reported for the
period of the previous year, when the firm was still a private
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   On average, analysts had been expecting Goldman to earn $1.48 a
share. Investors bid up the firm's shares to $118.25, a gain of
$4.8125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Goldman executives were marketing shares in the
firm to investors, they insisted that the firm would become less
dependent on unpredictable trading revenue. But Goldman, which went
public in May, derived just as much of its revenue _ about 45
percent _ from trading and principal investments last quarter as it
did a year before.
</P>
<P>
   Net revenue, revenue after interest expense, from trading and
principal investments jumped 54 percent, to $2.1 billion in the
quarter. Revenue from investment banking, one of the less volatile
businesses that Goldman hopes will account for a bigger share of
its revenue, rose 37 percent, to $1.24 billion, but as a share of
total revenue, it declined slightly. All told, revenue rose 50
percent from a year before, to $4.49 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive quarter, Goldman reported a return on
equity of more than 30 percent. That is significantly higher than
the 20 percent return the firm told investors it would shoot for,
and David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, cautioned them
against getting accustomed to such stellar returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers were very good across all the businesses, but the
real kicker came from trading,'' said Joan Solotar, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette who has been recommending Goldman's
stock. ``What people are concerned about is the sustainability of
those revenues. It would be naive to say they are not volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Viniar said the firm is ``not going to shrink trading.''
Instead, it plans to build its investment banking and money
management operations around the world so that they grow faster
than the trading operations. ``That is still our plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is financing that growth with the capital it raised
through its $3.6 billion initial stock offering. Many of Goldman's
current employees and former partners received shares of stock that
they could not sell for a year.
</P>
<P>
   In two months, about 50 million shares owned by those people and
two big institutional investors will be available for sale.

ANTICIPATING WALKOUT BY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, US AIRWAYS MAY SHUT
DOWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Mass., Pa., Fla., Ill.)   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10,000 unionized flight attendants at US Airways are
threatening an unusual walkout this Saturday, saying they will
disrupt flights on 49 of the airline's busiest routes.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants want to maximize pressure on the company
with a strategy that they have dubbed CHAOS _ Create Havoc Around
Our System.
</P>
<P>
   In response, US Airways, the nation's sixth-largest airline,
plans to take an unusual step of its own, saying that unless a
contract is reached by Saturday, it will suspend all operations,
rather than let the flight attendants whipsaw the company and its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the airline said, ``CHAOS by any name is CHAOS,
and US Airways will not operate under the threat of constant
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by US Air to shut down operations, industry experts
said, would be the first time that any airline closed itself down
in the face of a job action.
</P>
<P>
   Suspending operations would inconvenience the 150,000 passengers
US Air flies each day and would create the greatest disruption in
the eastern third of the nation, where the airline controls 36
percent of the regional market. Such a shutdown would affect
flights ranging from US Air's LaGuardia shuttle to Boston and
Washington as well as the company's routes to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In another unusual twist, the company has promised to continue
paying its 30,000 workers who are not flight attendants for as long
as is feasible during a shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The union is barred from taking any job action until a mandatory
30-day cooling off period ends at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike threat is already hurting the airline, with travel
agents reporting that they are steering consumers to other airlines
and that many US Airways passengers have switched their
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are completely canceling their trips,''
said Helene Singer, owner of Singer Travel in Reading, Pa. ``We're
advising people that US Air will not be flying, and people are
rebooking on other airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeking a refund on her US Air flight scheduled for Friday
night, Rita Gance, a nurse from Reading, Pa., reluctantly canceled
a trip to visit her mother in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed,'' she said. ``I looked at tickets at
other airlines, but the prices were ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wolf, the company's chairman, and Rakesh Gangwal, its
chief executive, have joined top union officials in Washington this
week for intense negotiations, helped by the National Mediation
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side was willing to predict the likelihood of a strike.
But union officials said flight attendants, borrowing a page from
the partial subway and air strikes often carried out by European
transportation unions, were ready to disrupt the 49 routes by
picketing or not showing up for work.
</P>
<P>
   The union has listed 49 routes it says it will disrupt, saying
it will not target every flight on those routes, but would instead
keep the company guessing about which flights would be affected.
Among the routes listed are are New York/LaGuardia-Orlando, New
York/LaGuardia-Tampa, Boston-Orlando, Pittsburgh-Chicago/O'Hare and
Philadelphia-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Nagin, the airline's executive vice president and
general counsel, said the company felt compelled to shut its
operations because it was worried that the union action would
strand or delay thousands of passengers and that customers would
lose hard-earned confidence in the airline. ``We are not going to
subject our customers to the uncertainty of chaos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagin said the 49 designated routes accounted for 21 percent of
the airline's 2,000 daily flights, but would affect passengers on
many other flights because of the airline's hub-and-spoke system.
The union has indicated that it would expand its action beyond the
49 routes if the dispute dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The company faults the Association of Flight Attendants for
rejecting a contract formula similar to those accepted by the
airline's pilots, mechanics and other main unions.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce what industry analysts say are the
highest costs per seat mile among major airlines, US Airways is
demanding that the flight attendants accept a formula that would
link the attendants' pay to the average of their counterparts at
the nation's four largest airlines plus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight attendants, whose contract expired in 1996,
assert that the airline's version of a parity formula would cut
their pay and fringe benefits by 5 percent. Union officials say the
other unions had a chance to help define their parity formula,
while the flight attendants have not been given that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty angry at the company,'' said Cynthia Kain, a
union spokeswoman. ``They feel these are good economic times and
they're being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants have not had a raise since 1996 and their
annual pay ranges from $17,145 to $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants are in a tight spot because many workers
in US Air's other unions are questioning why the attendants would
refuse to accept the formula they accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the employee groups represented by the other unions at the
company have entered into an agreement based on this concept, and
we think it's a fair solution and an important factor in enabling
US Airways to be competitive in a very competitive industry,''
Nagin said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' CHAOS strategy has been carried out once
before, when sporadic job actions forced the cancellation of a half
dozen Alaska Airline flights in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, a pilots' sickout by pilots created havoc for
American Airlines. At the peak of the 10-day sickout, one fourth of
the airline's 9,200 pilots called in sick, forcing the company to
cancel more than half of its 2,250 daily flights.

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT JUMPS TO RECORD $28 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (mcd) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Swollen by a huge bill for foreign oil and a
voracious spending spree by prosperous American consumers, the
nation's trade deficit jumped to a record $28 billion in January,
the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Exports sagged, breaking
a streak of seven consecutive advances.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deficit, $3.4 billion above the December level and 25
percent larger than the 1999 monthly average, suggested that the
booming American economy is still overwhelming the forces that
would narrow this imbalance, mainly a rebound in the economic
performance of other nations that buy American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economy continues to grow more quickly than its
trading partners _ and oil prices have gone up a lot,'' said
Catherine L. Mann, senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Federal Reserve announced its fifth interest-rate
increase since June in an effort to prevent overly rapid growth,
which ran at a 5.9 percent annual pace in the final three months of
the year, from driving up inflation.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said he
had been prepared to raise his gross domestic product estimate for
this quarter but decided after digesting Tuesday's figures to stick
with a still rapid rate of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The widening in the January gap between what the United States
buys from abroad and what it sells there occurred on both sides of
the equation. Imports jumped $1.9 billion, to a record $112.1
billion, while exports fell $1.5 billion after expanding every
month since May.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expressed no alarm about the results, which have
repeatedly been weak for January in recent years, suggesting more
than the usual imprecision in the way the Commerce Department
adjusts the data for recurring seasonal swings. But they did
express concern about the decline in exports, which if sustained
could cast doubt on the strength of economic recovery from the
Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. Japan, for example, slipped
back into a recession in the October-December 1999 quarter and
continues to show mixed signals about recovering in the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The American deficit with Japan did shrink in January, to $5.6
billion from $7 billion, but the deficit with China climbed to $6
billion from $5.6 billion. Figures on trade with individual
countries are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
</P>
<P>
   With China back as the No. 1 source of the American deficit _
perhaps now on a sustained basis _ it may be a bit harder for the
Clinton administration to persuade Congress to grant it normal
trade relations on a permanent basis as part of a deal under which
the United States would support China's admission to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Falling exports and rising imports contributed about equally to
the widening gap with China.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with Asia's newly industrialized economies _ Hong
Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, widened to $2.5 billion in
January from $1.8 billion in December, while it narrowed with
Western Europe to $3.6 billion from $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The trade gap with Canada, the biggest U.S. trading partner,
jumped to a record $4.3 billion from $3.4 billion, and the deficit
with Mexico, the other member of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, doubled to $1.8 billion, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
   As for oil, the import bill leaped to a record $7.9 billion,
more than double the $3.5 billion of January 1999, when prices had
fallen so sharply that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries collaborated with non-OPEC producers to curtail
production to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both the volume and price of oil imports rose for the month,
with the per-barrel price put at $23.18, the highest since the eve
of the Persian Gulf War in December 1990, when it hit $25.75. The
December 1999 price was $22.67.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been lobbying intensely for a production
increase by OPEC, which is to meet next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides importing $919 million more oil, the United States
raised its purchases of foreign cars by $677 million and its
purchases of computers, telecommunications gear and other capital
goods by $207 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Department, on revision, narrowed the overall American trade
deficit for December by $900 million, to $24.6 billion from the
$25.5 billion originally reported.

SUV MAKERS WORKING TO MAKE THEM SAFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alarmed by the damage sport-utility vehicles do to other cars in
accidents, auto makers are redesigning the heavy, high-riding
vehicles to make them less dangerous to other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say they are working on modifications that will
make SUVs lighter and lower so that accidents with ordinary
passenger cars damage the impact-absorbing frames of smaller
vehicles rather than the fragile cabins, where passengers are more
likely to be hurt. Some manufacturers are redesigning stiff steel
beams to crumple more easily so that the heavier, truck-like
vehicles absorb more of the blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years people have been buying these big, hulking SUVs
partly because they're going to win in a crash,'' said David Cole,
director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of
Automotive Transportation. ``But with so many of these things on
the road, people are starting to be concerned about what happens to
the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most popular class of automobile, SUVs now account
for nearly half of all car sales in the United States. And as
off-roading luxury cars, they generate large profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to mess with a good thing, automakers have railed
for years against accusations that SUVs cause more injuries than
other cars. But pressure has mounted as studies show they do. A
federal study published last year estimated SUVs caused nearly
1,000 unnecessary deaths a year in crashes with other vehicles,
largely because of design problems.
</P>
<P>
   The movement by all major manufacturers to reduce SUVs'
destructive potential on the road comes as regulatory agencies
including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as
well as Congress threatened to impose regulations on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of rumbling in Washington right now, and every
one of the manufacturers is going to be as proactive as they can to
avoid having somebody else set rules for them,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which makes Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Oldsmobile,
already has lowered the clearance of its Chevy Suburban by two
inches and lightened it by 250 pounds, starting with 1998 models.
Those changes were motivated both by safety concerns and customer
complaints about gas mileage and difficulty getting in and out of
such tall vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, automakers say they want to preserve the look and feel of
a truck, which is a main reason many customers buy sport-utility
vehicles. So they are working on changes that don't affect ground
clearance. One option industry sources say is likely to be common
is a suspension that automatically raises the vehicle for rough,
off-road travel and lowers it again for highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to design a vehicle that acts like a truck so you can
take it off the road,'' said Terry Rhadigan, a GM spokesman. ``At
the same time, you want to have some of the characteristics of a
car for regular driving, not only for impact compatibility but also
for fuel economy and handling.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the changes won't start showing up until the 2002
models, automakers say. GM plans to make its 2002 Oldsmobile
Bravada, GMC Envoy, and Chevrolet Blazer with steel rails up to two
inches lower inside their underbodies than in current versions.
Ford Motor plans to do the same for its Explorer, Expedition, and
Lincoln Navigator over the next two years, and DaimlerChrysler is
making several changes to the front end of its Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes are being contemplated for SUVs made by foreign
automakers, including Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller SUVs, such as Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Cherokee, are
not likely to change since they are considered less dangerous to
other vehicles, industry insiders said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the law came for him again, 33 years after he
first went underground, the man who was once called H. Rap Brown
had returned to Lowndes County in Alabama, where his life and those
of so many others began to change in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he was one of scores of youthful volunteers who worked
there registering voters, building the foundation of the civil
rights movement with names as diverse as Stokely Carmichael, Huey
Newton, John Lewis, Julian Bond, Bob Mants. They scattered in a
whirlwind of philosophies and fates, some distinguished, some
disgraced. Brown, as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, became one of the most provocative of black
radicals, associating with leaders of the Black Panther party and
eventually landing in prison on armed robbery charges in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday night, Brown, 56, long since paroled and now known
as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, was back in Lowndes for a very different
reason. He had fled there from his home in Atlanta and was huddling
in an isolated rural shed, accused of firing a high-powered assault
rifle on Thursday night at two Atlanta sheriff's deputies, one of
whom died from blood loss. When he fired on U.S. marshals who were
pursuing him near the small town of White Hall, they released
police dogs into the field, and he was on the move again.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, at about 10:30 p.m. Monday, John Williams, a
250-pound Lowndes County Sheriff's deputy known as ``Big John,''
saw him cross a railroad track about a quarter mile from the shed.
He was walking slowly, trying to look like an ordinary citizen, but
Williams recognized him, brought him down to the ground and
shackled him. H. Rap Brown was in custody once again.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, after standing before a federal magistrate
in Montgomery to be turned over to Georgia authorities, he looked
at a reporter in the courtroom and uttered a familiar sentiment:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a government conspiracy,'' he said as he was led away.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, J.L. Chestnut, told reporters that Al-Amin denied
shooting anyone and would fight extradition to Georgia. (Gov. Don
Siegelman's office said he would sign the extradition papers as
soon as he received them from Georgia on Wednesday morning.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been fighting the system since he was 16 years old, and
the system has been trying to kill him,'' said Chestnut, one of the
first black lawyers in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after the court hearing, the FBI announced that it
had found near the railroad tracks a .223 Ruger high-powered rifle
matching the description of the one used to kill Fulton County
Sheriff's deputy Ricky Kinchen and wound Deputy Aldranon English.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of law-enforcement officers and well-wishers attended
Kinchen's funeral on Tuesday at the Jackson Memorial Baptist Church
in northwest Atlanta. In a 2-hour service punctuated by emotional
renditions of gospel songs, Kinchen _ who, along with English, was
black _ was eulogized as a model deputy before he was killed at the
age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the assignment, Ricky was always dedicated to
the mission,'' said Maj. Michael Cooke, Kinchen's supervisor. ``He
was as tough as nails when he needed to be and never shied away
from a field confrontation. He was certainly the type of deputy
that you would want to cover your back if you got into a tight
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of Al-Amin's return to Lowndes County came as
a sorrowful shock to many of the people who worked beside him
registering voters 35 years ago. Some could not believe that the
man who spent the last 25 years as a non-violent Muslim cleric in
the West End of Atlanta would explode in a seemingly unprovoked
blaze of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hard to get people to register back then, but he was
good at it, very persuasive,'' said John Jackson, the mayor of
White Hall, who has known Al-Amin since the 1960s. ``And lately
when I've talked to him, he always seemed calm, never violent. It's
just hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   But others remembered his impatience with the slow process of
civil disobedience and peaceful change, which eventually led him
away from the mainstream civil rights movement and into the world
of fury and fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this frustration, this growing sense of
discontent,'' said Rep. John Lewis, once a leader of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and now a Democratic House member
from Atlanta. ``So many young people come down to Lowndes with the
idea that they could change people in a day or a week, that they
could liberate the natives in one summer. They had a different
mindset about the tempo of change. I don't know _ this is just one
of the saddest tales I've witnessed in the history of the
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The SNCC volunteer students were drawn to the impoverished
county of Lowndes because more than 85 percent of its population
was black, yet there was not one black registered voter. Most of
the blacks were sharecroppers, and registering usually meant that
the white landowner evicted them from their farms, sending many to
live in makeshift tent cities, one of which used to exist a few
blocks from where Al-Amin was captured. The students knocked on
doors and tried to persuade wary residents to take back their
county.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was slow work, and it took courage for those people to
register,'' said John Hulett, an organizer who worked with Al-Amin
and is now a probate judge in Lowndes. ``Those were the days of
poll taxes and literacy tests, and people would just turn up shot
to death.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-60s, the political party that the students willed
into being _ known as the Lowndes County Freedom Party _ chose for
its symbol a black panther, a more aggressive representation than
the elephant used by the Republicans or the rooster used by the
all-white state Democratic party. A few years later, when Newton
and others left Lowndes for California, they decided to use the
same symbol for their party, which was far more militant than the
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin converted to Islam in 1971 while imprisoned in New York
for an armed robbery tha ended his years underground. He moved to
Atlanta five years later when he was paroled. Islam does not have
ordained clergy or divinity schools, so when he formed his own
mosque in the West End of Atlanta, the congregation named him imam,
or prayer leader. He later became nationally prominent in promoting
the growth of Islam in cities around the country, and at one point
headed Atlanta's Council of Imams.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting on Thursday, investigators were at first
unaware of his old political connection to Lowndes County, instead
tracing him back to White Hall through an automobile registration.
Bill Imfeld, the FBI's special agent in charge of the lower half of
Alabama, said agents found Al-Amin had a Toyota 4Runner registered
in White Hall, and soon learned of his old ties. They spent most of
the weekend knocking on doors in the town of 1,800 people and
looking for his car, turning up little until three federal marshals
were fired upon Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   There remain several unanswered questions. English has insisted
to investigators that he fired on Al-Amin during the Atlanta
shooting, hitting him in the middle of his body. The police found a
blood trail leading from the site to a nearby vacant house. But
paramedics who examined Al-Amin on Tuesday said he had no injuries.
Al-Amin was wearing a bullet-proof vest when he was captured, but
investigators said it was an old model, and were surprised that it
might have deflected a direct shot.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond the overarching question of why Al-Amin may have
exploded after 25 years, there is the persistent question of why he
returned to Lowndes, where he would inevitably have been traced.
The sheriff's department said he had apparently been staying in the
home of a friend, Sahib Abdul Salaam, and Sheriff Willie Vaughner
speculated that he believed he could hide in a rural county with
little police presence.
</P>
<P>
   But to Wayne Flynt, a prominent history professor at Auburn
University and an expert on the early civil rights movement,
Al-Amin hoped to receive help from the same people he had once
helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people there haven't followed his career,'' Flynt said.
``But they're suspicious of the police, and they knew Rap Brown as
one of their own. All they knew was, at a critical time, when
people were being killed and they were terrified, Rap Brown came
there and befriended them.''

CONGRESSMAN OFFERS COMPROMISE TO SOLVE DEADLOCK ON PATIENTS' RIGHTS
LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House and the Senate deadlocked on
legislation to define patients' rights, an influential congressman
proposed a compromise Tuesday on one of the biggest issues in
dispute: How many Americans should be protected by new federal
standards?
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came from Rep. Charlie Norwood, co-author of the
bill passed by the House last October.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, a Georgia Republican widely viewed as a champion of
patients' rights, said he still believed that all Americans with
health insurance should have the protections of federal law to
guarantee access to medical specialists, emergency care and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   In a major concession to the Senate, Norwood said Tuesday that
he could accept the Senate's position setting federal standards for
a much smaller group of people, provided that Congress also
clarified the states' authority to regulate insurance for everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This arrangement would ensure that all Americans have access
to patient protections through either federal or state law,''
Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said the House bill would protect 169 million people
with private health insurance. By contrast, he said, many of the
basic consumer protections in the Senate bill would apply only to
56 million people in group health plans regulated by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they had limited the scope of their bill
because they did not want to usurp the states' authority to
regulate insurance. If that is true, Norwood said, the Republicans
should have no objections to his proposal to clarify the states'
authority to protect patients. In fact, he said, when states have
tried to set standards for health insurance and managed health
care, they have often been challenged in court by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood's proposal puts pressure on Senate Republicans to
justify the limited scope of the bill passed by the Senate last
July. Under that bill, as under Norwood's proposed compromise, most
people in health maintenance organizations would have to look to
the states, not to the federal government, for protection.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators have been meeting for about three
weeks and have reached agreement on a few issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Osterberg, a spokeswoman for Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma,
the assistant Republican leader, said: ``Senator Nickles will not
have a comment on the Norwood proposal. He's not going to negotiate
in the press. The conferees are making progress toward a strong
patient's bill of rights, and they will continue to forge ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Ohio State
University, said he doubted that many people would want the
solution Norwood proposed. But Jost said: ``It forces the Senate
conferees to confront honestly what they are proposing. It may be
useful in driving the Senate toward adopting something closer to
the House position, which calls for comprehensive regulation of
employee health benefit plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard I. Smith, vice president of the American Association of
Health Plans, scorned Norwood's proposal, saying it could expose
HMO's to ``unrestricted liability'' in lawsuits filed by patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, the main Democratic sponsor of
the House bill, said: ``Charlie Norwood is simply asking if the
Senate really knows what it is doing. I have the same question.''
</P>
<P>
   James P. Manley, a spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said Norwood's proposal ``helps expose the hypocrisy of
the Senate Republican position.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans really supported states' rights, Manley said,
they would make it easier for employer-sponsored health plans to be
sued in state court under state law, as many Democrats want. A 1974
federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, has made
it difficult for patients to win such lawsuits.

GORE WOULD NOT PUSH FOR A NEW INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As part of an administration that has been under
constant investigation, Democratic presidential contender Al Gore
said Tuesday that he would not push for a new independent counsel
law, arguing ``I don't sense any great public demand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, whom Republicans contended should have been
the target of a special prosecutor's probe for his fund-raising
activities, made it clear that he did not regret the expiration of
the law that triggered the long-running Whitewater investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress already decided to do away with it,'' he said. ``I
think Congress spoke loudly and clearly in a bipartisan voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also touched on a range of issues likely to come up in the
campaign against Republican George W. Bush and cited liberal Texas
columnist Molly Ivins to back up his suggestion that the governor
lacks the experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also stated his support for a Clinton administration
proposal to phase out the gasoline additive MTBE, which is
manufactured in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law, which was signed by Clinton, has
become a sore point among Democrats who contend that it has been
used to conduct open-ended witch hunts and for Republicans who
allege it has been selectively and politically applied to
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress declined to reauthorize the law that was the
basis for the appointment of a series of controversial special
prosecutors charged with probing Clinton administration activities.
</P>
<P>
   The most wide-ranging and most criticized probe was Kenneth
Starr's investigation of a series of alleged wrongdoings including
the Clintons' involvement in an Arkansas development deal called
Whitewater and the president's affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Starr's successor, Robert Ray, issued the first of
several reports on the matters under investigation. Ray concluded
that no deliberate wrongdoing had occurred regarding the
administration's use of FBI files on several prominent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dodged an independent counsel review after Attorney General
Janet Reno decided that the vice president's fund-raising
activities during the 1996 presidential election did not warrant
additional investigation. Reno's decision sparked an uproar among
congressional Republicans, particularly after it was revealed that
a number of high-ranking officials, including FBI director Louis
Freeh, had lobbied for a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans have been reluctant to push for the
reauthorization of an independent counsel law, which they believe
was also used unfairly to harass GOP presidents.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers also say they
would like to devise a way of probing administrative wrongdoing
that is more narrowly focused and less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would be willing to consider other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an open mind on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he wasn't bothered by criticism leveled at him by
Republicans that, even as he calls for campaign-finance reform, he
continues to raise money, including the unregulated ``soft money,''
which the vice president says he wants to eliminate. The vice
president is scheduled to attend Democratic National Committee
fund-raisers Friday in Houston, where the party is expected to
raise soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you have to unilaterally disarm in order to
advocate reform,'' he said during the interview conducted after a
fund-raiser on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he will continue to inject the issue of whether Bush
has the experience to be in the White House into the presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised the question, and I think it is invited by the
economic plan he has put forward,'' Gore said in reference to
Bush's large tax cut proposal, which the vice president claims will
drain the projected federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president did not directly address whether Bush's stint
as governor was adequate training for the White House. But to drive
home his point he paraphrased others, including Austin-based
columnist Ivins, who has just written a humorous and critical book
about Bush titled ``Shrub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for his office, you know I think five years as governor is
worth a good deal,'' he said. ``Now Molly Ivins says the office of
governor in Texas is the fifth most powerful statewide position.
And the Republican author of a proposed amendment to the Texas
constitution says that among all 50 states, it has by far the
weakest and least consequential governor's office. But it is not
for me to pass judgment on the nature of his experience and how it
bears on the qualifications for the office he now seeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added, ``but I think that when he puts forth economic
proposals like the one he has, it is bound to focus people's
attention on what in the world is behind that and does he have the
experience to be president. Let's take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor Gore said that shouldn't be considered in the
presidential race are high school and college grades and test
scores. Last weekend The Washington Post revealed that Gore was a
classic underachiever who scored far better than Bush on the SATs
but whose grades at St. Alban's prep school and Harvard were uneven
and rarely stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, annoyed at the unauthorized release of his college and
high school transcripts, said he did not think they were relevant
to the presidential contest. ``I sure don't,'' he said. Referring
to the transcripts, he repeated several times, ``I refused to
release them.''
</P>
<P>
   On a policy matter, the vice president also said he supported
the phasing out of MTBE, a move that could have a substantial
economic impact in Houston, which is the center of production for
the fuel additive.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Environmental Protection Agency Commissioner Carol
Browner said she would ask Congress to change the Clean Air Act of
1990 to urge the substitution of corn-based ethanol instead for
MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether. Environmental officials said
that while MTBE helps reduce air pollution, it has seeped into
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised Browner's plan, calling it a ``road map to maximize
environmental and economic benefits for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative road map recommended yesterday, if followed,
will allow us to phase out MTBE with all deliberate speed to limit
water pollution problems associated with it, while at the same time
avoiding regional spikes in the gasoline prices and promoting use
of alternative fuels, principally ethanol, in a way that enhances
air quality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also acknowledged that rising gas prices will
be an issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is already on people's minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think what we need is tough diplomacy to bring the
OPEC price down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore added that other steps included ``the management of
strategic petroleum reserves to mitigate price increases, regional
storage reserves, and domestic drilling and production incentives
and incentives for alternative sources of energy.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ The effort by the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez to
prevent his return to his father in Cuba was stymied Tuesday when a
federal judge dismissed a lawsuit requesting a political asylum
hearing for the 6-year-old boy, concluding that the long, bitter
legal battle is not in Elian's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled here Tuesday that
only Attorney General Janet Reno could grant Elian asylum. In
Washington on Tuesday, Reno said she would not grant the child
asylum and said he should be promptly returned to his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, in Cardenas, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything that should be done after proper
consultation to insure that the child is reunited with his father
in an orderly, fair and prompt way,'' said Reno in a news
conference Tuesday. ``It is time for this little boy to move on
with life at his father's side.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives said late Tuesday that
they had already filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals. They also requested that the court delay the boy's
return pending the outcome of any appeal, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found floating off the Florida coast on
Thanksgiving, the sole survivor of an attempt to reach the United
States in which his mother had perished.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives Tuesday refused to
acknowledge defeat. ``We are confident,'' said Kendall Coffey, a
lawyer for the family.
</P>
<P>
   But, experts on child custody and immigration who have followed
this international custody battle said the lawyers are just trying
to put a brave face on what appears to be a sound defeat for
Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terminal,'' said David Abraham, a professor of
immigration law at the University of Miami. He said the ruling cut
through a sideshow of international politics that had obfuscated
what should have been a simple custody case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moore, who did not rule from the bench but posted his decision
on the Internet, affirmed the government's assertion that Elian's
father, not Elian himself, must speak for the child's legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old is too young to understand the legal questions in
such a case, the judge said. While Moore concluded that the
relatives' lawsuit was well intended, he wrote, ``Each passing day
is another day lost between Juan Gonzalez and his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Elian's relatives continued their fight
to keep him here, appealing the decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The appeal argues that U.S.
immigration laws do not exclude children from asking for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   If they have to, they will take Elian's case to the Supreme
Court, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has not yet had his day in court,'' said Spencer Eig,
one of eight lawyers representing Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great
uncle and temporary guardian.
</P>
<P>
   He and other lawyers said they were still hopeful that Elian
could somehow win an asylum hearing, saying that U.S. immigration
laws allow any ``alien'' to apply for asylum, even children. ``Any
alien means Elian,'' said Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   But, to exclude the father as the boy's legal representative,
the judge ruled, would have required proof that he abused the
child. There was no such proof, the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, who had said he did not trust ``corrupt''
American courts, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government issued a cautious statement: ``We must
analyze with serenity and calm the apparently positive news,
without underestimating the obstacles and difficulties still
necessary to overcome in order to achieve the kidnapped boy's
return to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where about 40 people demonstrated peacefully outside
Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, it was a momentous but
oddly quiet day in an emotional saga.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the federal courthouse in downtown
Miami, Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin, said: ``I'm
overwhelmed. I have faith, and I will keep my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen found Elian floating on an inner tube off the coast of
Fort Lauderdale last November. His mother, Elizabet Brotons, and 10
others were killed when their boat capsized on a crossing from
Cuba. Elian quickly became a symbol of freedom in Miami's Cuban
American community and the prize in a tug of war between Fidel
Castro, the Cuban president, and anti-Castro groups here.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's face began appearing on T-shirts and posters in the
United States and on billboards in Cuba. People marched on both
sides of the Florida Straits, while in the United States
politicians took sides and held news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   In January, in a decision approved by Reno and endorsed by
President Bill Clinton, the immigration service ordered that Elian
be returned to his father, even though Gonzalez had refused to come
to Miami to ask for his son's return in court. Elian's relatives
here countered with the lawsuit demanding an asylum hearing as
Cuban Americans marched through the streets, clogging traffic and
shouting their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, even though the news was perhaps even worse for
them, Cuban American leaders said they planned no demonstrations
and would await the final legal outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the judge's decision,'' said Luis Felipe Rojas,
press secretary for Movimiento Democracia, which had organized
previous demonstrations. Rojas said those demonstrations had been
organized to demand that Elian's case be heard by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Many Miamians, including some in the Cuban American community,
said the January demonstrations damaged the sophisticated,
cosmopolitan image to which Miami aspires. And business owners
worried that television images of the demonstrations _ including
one in which a frustrated motorist drove his car through a line of
hand-holding protesters _ could damage the city's tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   In what could only be described as a strange distraction
Tuesday, a live rooster crowed from a tree outside the federal
courthouse in downtown Miami as reporters, photographers and
television news crews gathered for a noon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, it is not unusual for relatives of people on trial to
sacrifice a chicken or other animal outside the courthouses in a
Santeria or other religious ceremony, for luck. The rooster, some
people here said, may have somehow escaped such a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a handful of disappointed Cuban Americans said the judge
had erred in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no respect for Elian's rights,'' said Jorge
Gonzalez, who pitched a tent outside the Miami-Dade County
Courthouse in January and went on a hunger strike with two other
men to protest the immigration service's decision to send Elian
home.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Miami, said Abraham, would such a simple case become so
murky and yet so spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's ruling, Abraham said, ``brings us back to the core of
the case _ that a 6-yar-old is spoken for by the surviving parent,
unless that parent is incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, he said, prevents relatives around the world from
using this case as an excuse to simply keep visiting children and
ignore a parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it highly unlikely the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
will overturn it,'' said Abraham. ``You can't deny the law of the
land when it suits you.''

BOSTON JOINS CITIES' PUSH FOR GUN-SAFETY STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding to pressure on the firearms industry to keep
children and criminals from using guns, Boston officials will
announce Wednesday that the city will give preferential treatment
in awarding contracts to gun companies that voluntarily agree to
abide by sweeping gun safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes after the federal government brokered a deal
with Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson last week to put child-proof
safety latches on its new guns, install ``smart gun'' technology to
prevent unauthorized usage, and to refuse to sell its weapons at
gun shows unless buyers of all guns at the shows passed background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development, a driving force
behind the settlement, is trying to get other gun manufacturers to
follow the lead of Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's biggest gun
company.
</P>
<P>
   HUD announced over the weekend that it would give preferential
consideration in the awarding of gun purchase contracts to
companies that agree to abide by tenets of the Smith &AMP; Wesson deal.
</P>
<P>
   Boston will add its name to a list of cities making the same
demand of their gun contractors, Merita Hopkins, the city's
corporation counsel, confirmed in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a competitive marketplace, ``it could be quite effective'' in
bringing other gun manufacturers on board, Hopkins said. ``What
we're doing is encouraging folks to make a preference.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said she did not know how much contract money is
involved. The police department buys its guns ``according to
need,'' she said, and there is ``not a regular purchase every
year.'' The last purchase the city made was from Glock Inc., based
in Smyrna, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Glock will not sign the gun-control agreement signed by Smith &AMP;
Wesson, Glock officials told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The deal-breaker was the creation of an outside ``oversight
commission,'' made up of local, state, and federal officials, that
would supervise the gun manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission is an absurd concept,'' said Paul Jannuzzo,
vice president and general counsel of the company, a unit of Glock
GmbH of Austria. ``It's overly broad. It's more powerful than any
regulatory agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smith &AMP; Wesson deal _ a settlement to end lawsuits by dozens
of cities and counties nationwide _ imposed unprecedented
restrictions on the company's gun designs, marketing, and sales
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from installing the safety latches, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed
to add a second, secret code onto their pistols to help law
enforcement officials trace the guns. The firm also agreed not to
market guns to appeal to children or criminals. For example, the
company cannot advertise a gun as ``fingerprint-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed not to sell a large-capacity magazine and
said it would force buyers to wait two weeks before purchasing
multiple guns, a move that allows law enforcement officials to
track suspicious purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was met with derision by gun-control opponents and
other gun manufacturers. So far, no other gun makers have signed on
to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of lost contracts is meant to step up the pressure on
the nation's other firearms manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo's order on Saturday affects purchases
made by the nation's 3,200 public housing authorities. Cuomo also
encouraged the authorities to apply the same requirement to private
subcontractors that provide security at housing developments. A HUD
spokeswoman said she did not know how much contract money is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came after New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
broached the strategy last week. He said he had persuaded several
mayors in New York state to agree to refuse contracts to gun
companies that do not abide by the Smith &AMP; Wesson restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said there were some legal problems in outright refusal of
a contract. Instead, Cuomo, along with the mayors of Detroit,
Miami-Dade, and Atlanta, decided to simply give ``preferential''
consideration to acquiescent gun makers.

TERRORIST THREAT ALTERED CLINTON PLAN TO VISIT BANGLADESHI
VILLAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. officials said Tuesday that President
Clinton's plan to visit a Bangladeshi village this week was
canceled after a terrorist threat possibly linked to Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile who has been accused of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials received information late last week
that terrorists were considering a possible attack on Clinton and
his entourage, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Secret Service called off Clinton's 28-mile
helicopter trip from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, to the rural
village of Joypura.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that Clinton's helicopter was to have flown
over a heavily wooded area, where it would be easy for an attacker
to hide with a shoulder-launched missile. But officials declined to
say whether that was the specific threat.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, whom the FBI recently added to its most-wanted list,
is suspected of masterminding the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection
of the fundamentalist Taliban, who control most of the country.

<P>
   NETANYA, Israel _ Yosef Bienenstock, who had survived eight
death camps during the Holocaust because of his skills as a
handyman, finally returned to Poland to get his little brother's
bones in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Tuning out his emotions, he traveled straight to the Jewish
cemetery in the small town of Wadowice, where he grew up next door
to Lolek, a brainy Catholic kid who always let Yosef copy his
homework. Lolek was the nickname for Karol Wojtyla, now Pope John
Paul II, 79, who is six months younger than Bienenstock, 80.
</P>
<P>
   Bienenstock had prepared himself for the tin tombstone he knew
to be on his brother's grave. Of the 10 people in their family,
only he and this one brother, Romek, had survived the Nazi camps.
But his brother died of starvation, fatigue and heartsickness days
after making his way back to their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteriously, from the grave, there rose a marble monument to
his little brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can this be?'' Bienenstock said he asked the gravekeeper.
The gravekeeper explained that the pope had visited, and seeing the
pathetic grave marker for his former neighbor, had quietly ordered
a new one that did him justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of man he is,'' Bienenstock, a retired
clockmaker, said during an interview Monday in the lush garden
behind his seaside house. ``He grew up with us and he never forgot
us. That's why he demanded from the Christian world to understand
that the Jews of today cannot be held responsible for the
crucifixion. That's why he called the Holocaust an enormity. That's
why he goes to Jewish synagogues and to Jewish cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what more people want from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bienenstock is a compact, wry man who dresses in sweater vests
and neckties, unusually formal for an Israeli. He was one of
several elderly Jews from the pope's hometown invited to meet with
him on Thursday at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Of the 2,500
Jews in Wadowice during the pope's childhood _ about a quarter of
the town _ only 80 outlived the Holocaust. Now about 20 are still
alive, 16 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Before the visit, Bienenstock said he did not know if he would
survive the excitement until the reunion with his boyhood buddy.
Over the years, Bienenstock said, he had considered requesting an
audience with the pope at the Vatican, but he decided to wait,
believing that one day the pope would come to him in Israel, and it
would mean that much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived in the house of a Jew,'' Bienenstock said of the pope
as a boy. ``It was a long-term rental. On the one side was a
church. On the other was us, the Jews. He was in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``From age zero, we used to play together _ marbles and soccer,
but the soccer ball was made of rags. In soccer, his ability wasn't
the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always was the goalie, and the balls would whistle by him
into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to laugh a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very good, very quiet kid. I was a little terror. At
night, I used to run over and he'd let me copy his homework. For a
period at school, we shared a bench, which was very profitable for
me. I hope they don't cancel my degrees for saying so.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was known to be a genius, not that we ever thought he would
become pope or anything. We treated him the way he treated us,
always with gentleness. When we were bigger, he went to gymnasium
and I went to yeshiva. So what? We still continued. We were
religious Jews but we spoke Polish, and the only difference between
him and us were the holy days and Friday nights, when we spoke
Yiddish.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Germans entered their town after the war began, Karol
Wojtyla was already away at the university. Bienenstock said he
would not detail the degradation he suffered except to offer one
example, from the first days, before they were sent to camps. One
of his older brothers was a rabbi, he said, and a German officer
ordered Bienenstock to chop off the brother's beard and cut off his
side-curls. With an ax.
</P>
<P>
   As Bienenstock described his childhood, his petite wife, Tonya,
sat by his side when she was not jumping up to water plants, fetch
drinks or find letters that testified to her husband's career of
volunteerism. They met at a concentration camp. One day,
Bienenstock, who was in charge of unclogging the toilets, found a
gold wedding band in the muck of a latrine. He said he cleaned it
off and gave it to her. ``If we survive, and if I can find you,
with this ring, I will thee wed,'' he said he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be pretty,'' said Mrs. Bienenstock, who still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't ugly, really,'' her husband said. ``And I could
have chosen anybody. The girls really liked me, for some reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The camps that Bienenstock passed through formed a grim
itinerary, from Dachau to Sachsenhausen to Auschwitz. He is
convinced that he survived because he was an expert tinkerer, whom
the camp directors used to call ``the magician'' and page over the
loudspeakers.
</P>

   ``The pope, at the time, was 19 years old, a student,'' he said.
``Who would have given him a second look in those days? What could
he have done to stop the wickedness? Personally, I don't think he
should apologize at all. It really pains me to hear all the
nonsense in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have no idea how much he has done. His recognition of
the Holocaust _ given all those Holocaust deniers _ his recognition
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have him. I know. I see in his old face the
face of the little boy, the little big-hearted boy. I personally
think they couldn't have chosen a more human person for a pope than
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the marble marker at his brother's grave, Bienenstock
decided to carry through on his plans. He gave the cemetery guard a
bottle of vodka and sent him away. With the help of his daughter, a
young Israeli who was a junior diplomat, he disinterred Romek. They
found little more than small bones, but they packed them all in a
suitcase, and with the help of his daughter's diplomatic passport,
smuggled them out of Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Romek Bienenstock's tombstone is more humble, made of local
stone, basalt. But it is close-by in Netanya. And its inscription,
from the book of Jeremiah, reads: ``And I shall raise you from your
graves, my people, and I shall bring you to the land of Israel.''

NORTEL PUT UP $1.4 BLLION FOR CORETEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dramatizing the superheated market for optical
networking technology, CoreTek Inc., a 120-person company that has
not even begun making its marquee product, was snapped up by Nortel
Networks for $1.4 billion in stock Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings to nearly $8 billion the amount spent by Nortel
since January to grab optical networking start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It's battling Lucent Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., and
other telecommunications giants to maintain its dominance in the
exploding market for systems to handle ever more Internet traffic
over fiber-optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   CoreTek, Nortel executives said, is a key piece of their plan to
develop a fully optical version of the Internet in which data move
from computer to computer in pulses of light _ without ever getting
slowed down by being converted to electricity to pass through
conventional routers and switches.
</P>
<P>
   CoreTek, founded in 1994 by Parviz Tayebati, a 39-year-old
Iranian immigrant who became a US citizen in December, has recorded
small sales of specialty optical gear.
</P>
<P>
   But it was prized by Nortel for technology that it is still
developing, called ``tunable lasers.'' They can vastly increase the
capacity of networks besieged by booming Internet traffic, while
lowering operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds crazy to give up $1 billion for a company that's not
even making anything yet,'' said Alex Benik, a Yankee Group optical
networking analyst. ``But for Nortel it makes sense, and down the
road could be worth tens of billions'' in increased market
capitalization, if CoreTek helps it to dominate optical networking.
It's widely estimated that optical networking will be a $50 billion
market within four years.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, has
closed a $3.25 billion stock acquisition of Qtera Corp., whose
technology increases the distance that optical signals can be sent
without regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nortel said it would spend $3.25 billion in stock for
the optical switch maker Xros Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are critical technologies, and if you're fortunate
enough to have the stock currency to play in the game, you should
be going full steam ahead,'' said Patrick Houghton, an analyst at
Sutro &AMP; Co. in San Francisco, referring to Nortel's stock, which
this week hit a 52-week high. It closed Tuesday at $129.50, up
$3.3125.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, technologies have been developed to transmit
far more data over existing fiber-optic lines by transmitting data
in several different wavelengths _ literally, different colors of
light _ over a single line.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel is marketing a system that carries up to 160 wavelengths
on one line, so that owners of big global networks such as MCI
WorldCom Inc., Global Crossing Ltd., and AT&AMP;T Corp. can cram far
more Net traffic onto existing lines without having to spend
billions of dollars to lay more cable.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, network operators must install a different
type of laser for every color of light being generated to transmit
data. CoreTek's technology would slash costs by allowing a generic
unit to generate multiple colors.
</P>
<P>
   It would also improve traffic flow by allowing data being sent
in one wavelength to be converted to another and reducing or
eliminating the need to convert data from light to electricity to
pass through conventional routers and switches.
</P>
<P>
   Tayebati has a doctorate in quantum mathematics from the
University of Southern California and worked for five years in
optical computing at Foster-Miller of Waltham, an applied
commercial and defense research firm, before founding CoreTek.
</P>
<P>
   Along with wireless Net access, optical networking is one of the
hottest fields in telecommunications. In barely six months, Wall
Street's enthusiasm for the sector has rocketed two Massachusetts
optical networking concerns, Sycamore Networks Inc. of Chelmsford
and Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, into the top five among
Massachusetts companies, by stock market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's $1.4 billion acquisition price represents a jackpot for
CoreTek's venture capital financiers, including Broadview
International LLC of Waltham, Mass. that collectively have put $26
million into the company.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months ago, CoreTek got $6 million in funding from a
group that included Adams Capital Management and Hillman Co., both
of Pittsburgh, and Patricof &AMP; Co. of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Oak Investment Partners of Palo Alto, Calif., put
in $12 million as part of a $20 million second round of funding,
with undisclosed, smaller stakes added by Broadview, Adams,
Hillman, and JK&AMP;B Capital of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say what share of the $1.4 billion in Nortel
stock will go to Broadview and other venture backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made out well, and employees made out well,'' said the
marketing vice president for
</P>
<P>
   CoreTek, Tom Dudley. All 120 employees have some stock options,
he added. The company's real estate consists of a modest
60,000-square-foot building in Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mumford, president of Nortel Optical Networks, said
CoreTek's laser-tuning devices are ``clearly ahead'' of products
that Nortel is selling now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is magic in what they do,'' Mumford said.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel will issue 8.9 million shares of its stock for all
outstanding CoreTek shares when the deal closes this spring, with
$361 million of the purchase price contingent on CoreTek's meeting
milestones for product development.

   KANUNGU, Uganda _ As the last bodies were dumped into mass
graves Tuesday, forensic investigators at the site of the inferno
here that burned more than 400 people to death discovered the
bodies of several others who appeared to have been murdered and
dumped into a latrine pit.
</P>
<P>
   Who they were and why they were killed was not immediately
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators counted 330 bodies and estimated that more than a
hundred more may have died, their remains burned to ashes in a
chapel here controlled by a cult called the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God. It was the largest mass
suicide-murder since 1978, when 912 followers of Jim Jones died in
Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pressing question is the fate of the cult's
leader, Joseph Kibwetere, and his lieutenants. The police do not
know which, if any, of them died in the fire that was intentionally
set last Friday. Any still alive could face murder charges, the
police have said.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities pressed ahead, religious leaders tried to
distance themselves from the cult.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda's Roman Catholic hierarchy issued a statement Tuesday
that said the leaders of the cult, two of whom it identified as
former Roman Catholic priests, had been excommunicated from the
church because they had ``erred and broke the discipline of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   The sect members ``were misled by obsessed leaders into an
obnoxious form of religiosity completely rejected by the Catholic
Church,'' according to the statement, issued in Kampala, the
Ugandan capital. The bishops interrupted an annual retreat to
respond to suggestions that they had erred in isolating the sect
over disagreements on doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The sect's leaders had proclaimed the world would end in 2000,
saying they received the message directly from God, the bishops
said. The leaders had also preached that only those who heeded
their apocalyptic message would go directly to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Sects like this, including the most notorious and most
politically active here, the Lord's Resistance Army, have been
problems for the Ugandan government for years, and in recent
months, the police broke up two cults that were becoming threats.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What happened here was a ``crazy thing,'' and shows how people
can be brainwashed, said the Rev. Benon Nkwasinbwe, an Anglican
priest in northern Uganda. ``These kind of cults are spreading,''
he said as he walked around the compound. ``I'm very worried about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The problem is complicated for government and religious leaders,
who do not want to appear to infringe on religious freedom in this
mostly Christian country, but want to ensure that the country does
not endure a repeat of what happened last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not have to happen,'' the Rev. Martin Sempa, a leading
evangelical Christian leader said Tuesday night on Radio One,
repeatedly endorsing government efforts to flush out dangerous
extremist religious groups, ``and it should not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, members of Uganda's Parliament called for an inquiry
into the deaths and demanded that the police do a better job of
identifying potential problems among such groups.
</P>
<P>
   Active for more than a decade, the Ten Commandments Cult drew
many of its members from the Roman Catholic Church and incorporated
some of the Catholicism's symbols and teachings into its tenets and
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In another of the sect's chapels here, discarded green rosaries
lay about the floor, and the smashed remnants of ceramic figures of
Jesus and Mary littered the altar.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader, Kibwetere, had been a lay worker in a Roman
Catholic parish in Bushenyi, just north of here, before breaking
away from the faith and apparently bringing a number of his fellow
congregants with him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bishop William Magambo, head of the Anglican Diocese in
Bushenyi, said he knew of Kibwetere by reputation and his was not a
good one. ``Their leader was a rebel,'' Magambo said after he and
several aides examined the grounds and the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the trickle of loved ones who came to this remote spot in
the Rukungiri region of southwestern Uganda, near the country's
borders with Congo and Rwanda, there is confusion, anger and
sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Turyomurugendo lost four brothers, two sisters, a host of
nieces and nephews and her mother in the fire, and knows she could
have been among them. Only she, another sister and their father
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was trying to convince me to come,'' Turyomurugendo,
43, said as she sat on a log in the middle of a clearing on the
edge of the compound, ``but I told her I can't go in this church.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not like what she heard about how the cult forced its
members to sell their possessions to be admitted, how the leaders
tried to control communication among followers and outsiders, and
how parents were separated from children and spouses were split up
inside its compound. ``I told them not to come here, but they
refused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So, while many of her relatives packed up their few remaining
possessions and came here in July to live at the compound, she
stayed away. ``They would tell me that in the year 2000, they were
going to a new world,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She never had a chance to see them before they died, so Tuesday
she came from her village, Kirima, about five miles away. ``I just
came to see how they are buried,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a huge ditch was dug and, with not even a spoken
prayer, the charred, twisted remains were dumped into the pit, and
it was quickly covered with fresh earth. ``There was really nothing
more to do,'' Turyomurugendo said. ``There was just so many of
them.''

POPE SETS FOOT IN `BLESSED LAND' OF ISRAEL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II arrived in what he called ``this
blessed land'' of Israel on Tuesday, beginning the first official
visit by a Roman Catholic pontiff to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with profound emotion that I set foot in the land where
God chose to pitch his tent and made it possible for man to
encounter him more directly,'' the pope said in English after
landing at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this year of the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus
Christ, it has been my strong personal desire to come here and to
pray in the most important places which, from ancient times, have
seen God's interventions, the wonders he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every top Israeli official was on hand to welcome the
79-year-old pontiff after his short flight from Jordan, where he
celebrated Mass earlier in the day and visited a site where some
scholars say Jesus was baptized. The pope later flew by helicopter
to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's arrival in Israel marked the first time in 36 years
that a pope has visited the region. Pope Paul VI made an unofficial
visit in 1964, long before the Vatican and the Jewish state
established diplomatic relations, but he never publicly mentioned
Israel's name.
</P>
<P>
   After landing at the Tel Aviv airport Tuesday, John Paul, who
suffers from Parkinson's disease, slowly descended the steps of his
Royal Jordanian jet, his white skullcap blowing off in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Three youngsters representing the faiths of Islam, Judaism and
Christianity participated in the welcoming ceremony. The children,
who live in Jesus' boyhood town of Nazareth, held up a bowl of
Israeli soil, which John Paul touched with his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting the pontiff were Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
President Ezer Weizman as well as Muslim leaders and Christian
dignitaries. One woman bowed her head and kissed the pontiff's ring
in a traditional Catholic gesture of respect.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul noted changes that have come to the Vatican-Israeli
relationship, including the Holy See's diplomatic recognition of
the Jewish state in 1993. The pontiff called his pilgrimage ``a
tribute to the three religious traditions, which coexist in this
land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that my visit will serve to encourage and increase
interreligious dialogue and induce Jews, Christians and Muslims to
seek in their respective beliefs ... the motivation and the
perseverance to work for the peace and justice which the peoples of
the Holy Land do not yet have.
</P>
<P>
   ``May peace be God's gift to the land he chooses as his own.
Shalom,'' the pope said, using the traditional Hebrew greeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has stressed the spiritual quality of the pope's
journey. To many in the region, however, his visit is laden with
political significance.
</P>
<P>
   During his tour, which concludes Sunday, John Paul will meet
with Israeli and Palestinian leaders; celebrate Mass in areas
controlled by both groups; and speak privately and publicly with
Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, his itinerary calls for a visit to Bethlehem, the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank town where Jesus is believed to
have been born. John Paul is to meet with Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, celebrate Mass at Manger Square and stop at a
Palestinian refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will also spend time in Jerusalem, the ancient city
revered by Christians, Jews and Muslims. Palestinians hope to
establish the capital of their future state in the eastern part of
the city. Israelis consider all of Jerusalem their eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to John Paul on Tuesday, Weizman called Jerusalem
``the heart of the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what gives us our spiritual inspiration,'' he said.
``Jerusalem is the city of eternity, a city that has been
reunified. It is the city of the judges of Israel, the kings of
Israel and the prophets of Israel, the capital and source of pride
of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   From Tel Aviv, the pope flew to Jerusalem, where he was greeted
by Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, John Paul celebrated Mass in a soccer stadium
in Amman, Jordan, before a crowd of 50,000 flag-waving supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open your doors to Christ'' proclaimed the neon scoreboard.
Choirs from Iraq and Lebanon as well as Jordan performed, and 2,000
children received Holy Communion for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His pilgrimage is a spiritual blessing, and besides that, a
good testimony that our country is the Holy Land,'' said the Rev.
Nabil Haddad, a Jordanian Catholic priest. ``It will encourage the
faithful to come to Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope also visited the site alongside a stream that feeds
into the Jordan River where, according to some scholars, Jesus was
baptized by John the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslims in Jordan believe their country will benefit from
the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't all boil down to tourism and the economy,'' said
Susan Afanah, the Muslim director of Jordan Satellite Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to change the image that everywhere in the
Middle East, they are intolerant of Christians. Christians have
existed in the Arab world even before Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, in Jordan, we have never had any problems,'' she said.
``That's what's important to show the world.''

UN TO DISTRIBUTE CONDOMS TO TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United Nations is hoping a condom a day will help
keep AIDS away from its peacekeepers in Africa _ and prevent them
from spreading it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers arriving on recently authorized peace missions in
Sierra Leone and the Congo are to be issued one latex condom per
day after the United States pressured the Security Council earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, made
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Africa the focus of a
Security Council meeting in January. He said that UN peacekeepers
were spreading the deadly disease in the very countries they were
sent to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``All too often the sad truth is that, at times, in trying to
solve one problem, such as preventing a war or containing conflict,
UN peacekeepers contribute unintentionally to another serious
problem, the spread of AIDS,'' Holbrooke told a congressional panel
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials are trying to portray their decision to buy and
distribute condoms to their troops as unrelated to American
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously appreciate the added emphasis that Ambassador
Holbrooke has given to the issue . . . but we had been looking at
this issue in a more consolidated fashion for quite some time,''
said a senior UN official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says it has tried to address the problem
since 1995. It has issued manuals to peacekeepers explaining the
importance of using condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the United Nations has reimbursed national governments
that distributed condoms to their own troops on UN missions. Now
the United Nations will pay for the one-a-day condoms directly out
of the UN peacekeeping budget and make them available to all their
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations budget committee is expected to approve the
expenditure later this week for the 16,000 peacekeepers the United
Nations is sending to Sierra Leone and the Congo. It is expected to
cost $10 per man every month, or nearly $2 million a year for those
two missions.
</P>
<P>
   Extra condoms will be given to the local health authorities, the
UN official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says it keeps no statistics on the number of
its peacekeepers who contract the disease or were found responsible
for spreading it. UN spokesman Fred Eckhard acknowledged that
``because UN civilian and military personnel in peacekeeping or
humanitarian operations can be exposed to the dangers of
contracting or spreading AIDS, the United Nations has been stepping
up preventative measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior official said he could neither confirm nor deny
reports that several Croatian women contracted AIDS from UN troops.
Another UN official said on condition of anonymity that Croatia had
demanded that peacekeepers be tested before they were deployed in
eastern Slavonia in 1992. ``We said no and privately told them they
should get their own people tested to protect our troops,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations cannot demand mandatory AIDS testing from its
peacekeepers, he added. ``That's in line with the canon of our
human rights conventions. Even if you knew (a peacekeeper) was HIV
positive you cannot discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   UN officials say the new condom policy is not meant to be seen
as encouragement for peacekeepers to visit prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years there have been some highly publicized cases: a
band of Bulgarian peacekeepers were embroiled in gunfight in a
Cambodian brothel, Italian blue helmets in Mozambique were accused
of paying girls as young as 12 for sex and UN troops were found
visiting Muslim women in a house of prostitution near Sarajevo run
by a Serb militiaman during the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   A US official said Washington is pleased with the United
Nations' decision. ``Ambassador Holbrooke found when he went to
Africa last year that peacekeepers were getting and spreading AIDS
and he made an issue of it,'' he said. ``Naturally any kind of
preventive measure that can help we welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   After American pressure, the Security Council has agreed to
mention the AIDS issue in all resolutions establishing or renewing
peacekeeping missions. It calls for efforts to ``sensitize
peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS
and other communicable diseases.''

DIABETES DRUG LINKED TO LIVER FAILURE IS REMOVED FROM MARKET

<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday evening
that Rezulin, a diabetes drug linked to liver failure, would be
removed from the market immediately.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million Americans are now taking the drug, and the
agency urged them not to stop without first contacting their
doctors to obtain another treatment for their diabetes. Rezulin,
also known by the generic name troglitazone, has been prescribed to
lower blood sugar in people with Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes,
the most common form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, manufactured by Parke-Davis, a division of the
Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., had been criticized by
consumer safety groups and generated negative news reports during
the last year, because in rare instances it caused serious liver
damage and death.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction in March 1997, Rezulin has been linked to
90 cases of liver failure, resulting in 63 deaths and 10 liver
transplants. Three of the transplant recipients died. Ten other
patients recovered from severe liver failure, and 10 others are
still suffering from that condition.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of cases of liver failure was small compared with
the 1.9 million people who have taken the drug at one time or
another, and the FDA initially decided to keep Rezulin on the
market despite the risk, because it had a unique mode of action and
did help many patients.
</P>
<P>
   When Rezulin was marketed in 1997, it was the first in a class
of drugs that lowered blood sugar by making the body more sensitive
to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. In 1999,
the FDA approved two other drugs in the same class, Actos, marketed
by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries, and Avandia,
made by SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, said that the agency had changed its
position on Rezulin because data on the two newer drugs showed them
to be safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that they don't pose the kind of liver
toxicity that Rezulin does,'' Woodcock said. She said that the
newer drugs might also cause liver abnormalities, but that they
were not as risky as Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of the evaluation center,
said that if the two newer drugs had not become available, the FDA
probably would have left Rezulin on the market, because it was
important to have a drug of its type available.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we have other products that can give patients the same
benefit without having to assume that risk,'' Lumpkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Corr, president of research and development for
Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis, said, ``This certainly did take us by
surprise. We still believe that the benefits outweigh the risks and
that this drug produces enormous benefits for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Corr said the company would write letters to doctors telling
them that Rezulin was taken off the market, but he said he did not
know whether patients would be given refunds for leftover supplies
of the drug.

DEATHS IN US FROM DRUGS HIT RECORD LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug-related deaths have reached a record level in
America, while users could buy cocaine and heroin at some of the
lowest prices in two decades, according to a White House report
obtained by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, only four of every 10 addicts who needed
treatment received it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures surely are distressing news for the Clinton
administration, which is spending record amounts of money to fight
the war on drugs and is proposing an additional $1.6 billion toward
cutting off the supply in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,973 people died from drug-induced causes in 1997 _
nearly 44 people a day and an increase of 1,130 people over the
previous year. The rate of African-Americans dying from drugs
remains the highest among racial groups: 8.3 per 100,000
African-Americans died from drugs in 1997, the latest year for
which figures are available, owing to the difficulty in collecting
the data from a number of sources. That compares to 5.8 per 100,000
whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scandal that drug deaths are at the rate they're at,''
said Kevin B. Zeese, president of Common Sense for Drug Policy, a
Virginia group that supports more funding for treatment. ``It's
never focused on by the drug czar's office or by the media. The
underclass, the black and brown people, don't get the focus they
deserve. If you had 15,000 deaths every year for five years among
middle-class white people, there would be an outcry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 12,863 white people died from drugs in 1997. Overall,
the number of drug deaths has approximately doubled since the early
and mid-1980s, when cocaine usage was at a record level.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, hospital emergency rooms from selected cities
counted record numbers of drug-related episodes in 1998, the most
current year for which those figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is to be released thursday to the House
Appropriations Committee and is traditionally used by antidrug
officials to trumpet achievements, cites several accomplishments.
Among them: Youths' drug use dropped 13 percent last year; overall
cocaine use is down; drug crime and drug-related killings are down;
and there is a growing antimarijuana attitude among youths.
</P>
<P>
   But while youth drug dropped last year, it is at roughly the
same level it was in 1996, when Barry R. McCaffrey became the
nation's drug czar. What isn't known is whether his signature
initiative of a $2 billion TV ad prevention program will yield
significant results. Statisticians and health professionals say
that his anti-drug TV ads could help reduce drug use among youth
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But prevention ads for young people, note analysts, have nothing
to do with treatment of hard-core addicts.
</P>
<P>
   In the report's foreword, McCaffrey wrote about the power of
prevention in curbing rates of drug abuse and the need for
treatment of addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treatment can help them end dependence on addictive drugs,''
he wrote. ``Treatment programs also reduce the consequences of
addiction on the rest of society. Providing treatment for America's
chronic drug users is both compassionate public policy and a sound
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But on page 56, the report noted: ``A significant treatment gap
. . . exists. . . . Approximately five million drug users needed
immediate treatment, while 2.1 million received it.''
</P>
<P>
   That estimate represented a slight improvement from the year
before, but still only 42 percent received treatment. The report
notes that the national estimates need to be much more precise and
that a better understanding of the program's magnitude should be
known in August 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, the treatment-gap issue arose during the
House Appropriations Committee debate on the Colombian plan.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, proposed adding
$1.3 billion for treatment for US addicts, but it lost in a mostly
party-line vote. Late last year, McCaffrey opposed putting $100
million in new funds for treatment in the Colombian plan, arguing
it was wrong to mix two plans.
</P>
<P>
   In his office's report, studies show that prices for cocaine and
heroin keep falling.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine dealers, purchasing between 10 and 100 pure grams,
bought the drug for $44.51 per gram, according to 1998 preliminary
figures from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Heroin dealers,
buying between one and 10 grams, purchased it for $317.97 a gram.
Both figures were the lowest since 1981, when the DEA began
analyzing prices.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, drug users could buy heroin at a record low
$1,798 per pure gram, and a near-record low of $169 per pure gram
for cocaine. Purity for heroin was 24 percent and cocaine 71
percent, according to the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   The government's proposals to fight drugs in the coming fiscal
year show the largest increases for interdiction and reducing the
source of supply of drugs. In its $19.2 billion drug-fighting
proposal, the Clinton administration wants to increase funding by
11.4 percent for interdiction over the previous year and 10.3
percent for source reduction.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the report, on page 99, the drug office lists its
funding priorities for the next five years. The first one on the
list: ``Support for Plan Colombia and drug control activities in
the Andean region.
</P>
<P>
   National ``youth anti-drug'' media campaign is second. Treatment
is third.

POPE ARRIVES IN JERUSALEM AMID COMPETING CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II's historic pilgrimage through the
``history of salvation'' arrived Tuesday in this ancient city
revered as holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual significance embodied in the stone ramparts of
Jerusalem's Old City has also made it the most fought-over plot of
land in history, a struggle that continues today with rival
Palestinian and Israeli claims to the city as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he landed here, these intense and competing claims to
Jerusalem _ political and spiritual _ were boiling to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pope touched ground in an Israeli Blackhawk helicopter
as the sun set over the city, he was greeted in a welcoming
ceremony that included the song ``Jerusalem of Gold,'' an Israeli
anthem that celebrates the capture of historically Arab East
Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   And President Ezer Weizman, in his welcoming speech, pointedly
referred to Jerusalem as ``the capital of the state of Israel . . .
the heart of the Jewish people throughout all the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Palestinian Liberation Organization's minister
for Jerusalem affairs, Faisal Husseini, issued an appeal signed by
Palestinian political, religious, and academic leaders calling on
the Holy See ``to intervene to lift the siege of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, in turn, said he had come with a message of
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know how urgent is the need for peace and justice, not
for Israel alone, but for the entire region,'' said the pontiff.
``May peace be God's gift to the land he chose as his own.'' He
concluded with the Hebrew word for peace, ``Shalom.''
</P>
<P>
   By setting foot here at this critical juncture in the peace
process, the Pope inevitably entangled himself and the church in
the political struggle for the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the city is perhaps the most deeply emotional
issue for Palestinian and Israeli negotiators gathering this week
in Washington to negotiate a framework for a final peace plan that
both sides have agreed to reach by September.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Michael McGarry, rector of the Vatican's Tantour Ecumenical
Institute in Jerusalem, said the pope's spiritual pilgrimage _
which will take him to Bethlehem, Nazareth, the Galilee, and
Jerusalem _ inevitably crosses paths with the real world politics
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is seeded with landmines all over the place, but we
would have to say the status of Jerusalem is by far the most
explosive,'' said McGarry.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians see East Jerusalem and the Old City, which
Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed, as the
capital of a future state. Israel says Jerusalem has been the
eternal and indivisible capital of the Jewish people through
thousands of years, and it will never relinquish control of it.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the Herodian stones of the Western Wall, all that
remains after the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in
AD 70, is a symbol of their faith, and what they see as the miracle
of their return after 2,000 years in the diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are overwhelmingly Muslim but include a small
Christian minority, and Jerusalem is holy to both faiths. The third
most significant holy shrine in Islam sits atop the Temple Mount.
It is the Dome of the Rock, the golden symbol of the site where
Muslims believe the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of their most somber
shrine, the Holy Sepulchre, where it is believed Jesus was
crucified, buried, and rose again.
</P>
<P>
   On his scheduled route to Bethlehem Wednesday, the Pope will see
the Palestinian symbols of their claim to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As he drives through the streets of East Jerusalem, where he is
staying in the Latin Patriarchate's guest home on the Mount of
Olives, the pontiff is likely to see Palestinian flags flying on
rooftops and out of windows. Israeli municipal workers have been
busy trying to take them down, but they kept going back up.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem and the West Bank, streets were lined with posters
showing Yasser Arafat shaking hands with the Pope against an
altered background of the Dome of the Rock and church spires of the
Old City. They proclaim ``Welcome to Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's official position on Jerusalem was set out in an
accord signed by the Holy See and the PLO on Feb. 15. The document
rejected as ``morally and legally unacceptable'' unilateral
decisions or actions that would alter the status of Jerusalem _
wording widely seen as reference to Israel's annexation of East
Jerusalem and its continued construction of settlements ringing the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican-PLO accord also called for an internationally
guaranteed statute to protect religious rights in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has rejected the call for ``international guarantees''
and Foreign Minister David Levy labeled it a ``regretful
intervention'' in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Jarjoui, a Palestinian legislator and the head of the
Palestinian Authority's ministerial committee for church affairs,
said the Vatican document simply reiterated positions on Jerusalem
held by the United Nations for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement and this visit by the Pope are very important
as a way to remind the world that Jerusalem is the spiritual center
for all of us of all three faiths, and it should not be
unilaterally controlled by only one body,'' said Jarjoui.

TEST DELAY PUSHES BACK CLINTON'S DECISION ON MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced Tuesday that it will delay
by two months the next, decisive test of national missile defense
technology, likely pushing back to October President Clinton's
decision on whether to deploy the system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new schedule, this third test of the system meant to
shield the United States against a limited missile attack will be
conducted on June 26. The delay will allow the military to correct
mistakes that led to the failure of its last test in January,
according to Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, director of the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a very prudent approach to a high-risk
schedule,'' he said in announcing the new timetable Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule has come under increasing attack within the
Pentagon and from scientists, diplomats and members of Congress
from both parties who worry that the timetable is based on
political rather than technological considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration set the goal of building a system of 100
missile interceptors in Alaska by 2005 to defend against the threat
of a limited missile attack from a country like North Korea. That
requires letting contracts for construction by October or November.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration is asking Russia to amend
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which forbids a national
missile defense system. If the Russians continue to refuse to make
those changes, the United States must give a six-month warning that
it plans to violate the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president wants to pour concrete in May 2001, he has to
tell the Russians by November that he will break the treaty,'' said
Stephen Young, deputy director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the next test must succeed in order for the
Pentagon to meet its own standards for advising the president that
the missile-defense technology will work.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the delay, Secretary of Defense William Cohen will
give his recommendation to the president by August, the Pentagon
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the president is no longer planning to make his
final decision this summer, but will delay it until October,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been the strongest force behind the push for a
complicated missile defense system that is a scaled-down version of
the ``Star Wars'' defense system originally proposed by President
Ronald Reagan. Cost estimates for the system range from $13 billion
to $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Democrats have encouraged Clinton to make a
decision in favor of the system, both out of national security
concerns and to prevent Republicans from accusing the Democrats of
being soft on defense in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   But with growing doubts that the technology will be sufficiently
tested to make such a decision by the autumn, supporters of
deployment have joined opponents in asking Clinton to postpone a
decision. European allies also question why a decision has to be
made now, and argue against the national missile defense system
because it would kill the ABM treaty, which they view as a
cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming June test will be the third attempt to demonstrate
that a missile fired into space can hit a mock warhead propelled by
another missile. In the first test of the system in October, the
missile hit the warhead but received help reaching the target from
a decoy that was supposed to confuse it.
</P>
<P>
   The failure in January of the second test was attributed to a
leak in a pipe that carried the frigid nitrogen gas which cools the
infrared sensors needed to guide the missile in the last minutes of
the flight.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not John McCain the fiery maverick railing
on the floor of the Senate Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Arizona Republican who put condemnations of the
corrupting power of big money at the center of his losing
presidential bid used his much anticipated reappearance in the
chamber to speak mostly about the Western deployment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans eager for rapproachment, it was only toward the
end of his solitary 15 minutes in the Senate that McCain referred
to the presidential run that at one point looked as if it could
topple the front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not burden my colleagues with a full discussion of how
I spent my time away and what I learned from my experience,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke briefly of his gratitude toward the American people and
of their desire for change. ``I intend to do what I can, working
with my Congressional colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to
help bring about the changes to practices and institutions of our
democracy that they want and deserve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms, Mr. President, are not ends in themselves. They
are a means to a much more important end. They are intended to
sustain America's pride in the way we govern overselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If it seemed oblique and low key, it was intended that way. With
reconciliation in mind, both McCain and Republican leaders were
playing down their differences in part by giving the widest
possible meaning to the word reform. McCain was welcomed back to
the weekly Senate Republican lunch with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to hordes of waiting reporters after the lunch, Sen.
Trent Lott, the majority leader, attributed McCain's strong run in
the primaries to his ``emphasis on duty and honor and sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Of reform, the Mississippi Republican said: ``Reform is bigger
than just campaign finance reform. Reform is about reforming
education in America to make it more productive and to have our
schools safe and drug free. It's about reforming the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who now plans to use his national prominence to try to
help Republicans keep their congressional majority, told reporters
that the candidates he stumps for should be ``committed to my
agenda for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said they did not need to agree with his call to ban the
unlimited unregulated donations to political parties known as soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   He saved his harsh words for Vice President Al Gore, when asked
what he thought of the presumptive Democratic nominee's efforts to
compare himself to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if Gore was serious, he should unilaterally
renounce soft money fund-raising. He called for the vice president
to ``see that a full and complete investigation takes place of the
incredible abuses of the institutions of government and every
ethical standard concerning campaign finances that were
orchestrated by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, an official of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee said Democrats had compiled a list of
Republicans in competitive districts who had not voted for the
House version of McCain's campaign finance bill, in order to see if
McCain stumped for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We point out the hypocrisy,'' said Erik Smith, a spokesman for
the campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was invited to address House Republicans at their own
caucus on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain said he wanted the day to be as much like business
as usual as possible, there were signs of his new celebrity. As he
walked out of the subway beneath the Capitol, tourists and staffers
broke into spontaneous applause and called out ``our hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Though reporters knew when McCain was going to speak, he did not
give his colleagues much warning. So it was a Democrat, Sen.
Barbara Boxer of California, who introduced him as she finished her
own speech calling for gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the senator who has done such an amazing job in the
presidential race back on the floor,'' she said, ``I welcome him
back. The issues he raised I thought were vital to be raised.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had enjoyed his time in her state and added, ``I
hope that we can get some rebate from the numerous campaign
commercials that we purchased in her state.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boxer left. Except for Sen. Michael B. Enzi, the Wyoming
Republican who was presiding, not a senator was in the chamber as
McCain spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the assistant minority
leader, came to the floor. He walked across the aisle to talk to
McCain when he finished speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans did not even seem to know McCain had returned
until they were met by throngs of reporters outside their
closed-door lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, is he back today?'' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who runs the
Appropriations Committee, said cheerily, ``John doesn't bother
me.'' He added, ``I'm sort of sad to see him come back, because I
think I'm the meanest man in town right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch, Lott, who has often tangled with McCain, welcomed
him to a standing ovation. Two other Republican senators, Don
Nickles of Oklahoma and Larry E. Craig of Idaho also had kind
words. And so did Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican
National Committee.

<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court decided Tuesday to keep the tobacco
industry alive. But its condition remains critical and the court's
decision sets the stage for another congressional showdown on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the Clinton administration's claim that the
federal Food and Drug Administration had the authority to regulate
cigarettes and nicotine, a victory for the industry that helped
raise the price of tobacco company stocks, which have been
languishing for months.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision comes as cigarette makers are bracing for a
possibly devastating verdict in Florida, where a jury is hearing a
class-action case brought on behalf of smokers there. Analysts have
said that the jury may award tens of billions in punitive damages
against tobacco companies, forcing some producers, if not all, into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette executives also awoke to Tuesday's ruling after a bad
night. A San Francisco jury held late Monday that Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco must pay $1.72 million in compensatory
damages to a former smoker there. That same jury is considering
punitive damages, and a decision is expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Supreme Court's decision kicks tobacco
regulation back into an arena where both cigarette makers and their
opponents appear to agree it belongs: Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But just what lawmakers will do with an issue they have
approached with the same unease as gun control is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that this is going to happen,'' said Dr. David
Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration who moved to regulate tobacco. ``It's just a
question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., supported a broad tobacco
bill that among other things would have created a special
regulatory category for tobacco under the drug agency. But that
bill was opposed by the tobacco industry because it was costly and
did not give cigarette makers the legal protections they sought.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for McCain said Tuesday that he did not have any
immediate reaction to the Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette
producer, said it would back federal regulation of tobacco through
Congress if it was not classified as a ``drug'' by the Food and
Drug Administration. The producer, like other cigarette companies,
said Tuesday that it was pleased with the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Parrish, the senior vice president of Philip Morris, said
that the cigarette maker still backed regulation in areas like
youth marketing, disclosure of the hazards of tobacco products and
research intended to produce cigarettes that may be less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we went to members of Congress and met with
them privately to tell them we are serious about this,'' Parrish
said.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved with tobacco litigation said that Parrish
had met in recent months with several top Republican leaders,
including Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi and Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas. Parrish declined to comment. A spokesman for DeLay confirmed
that DeLay had met with Parrish. Lott's office did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement that Congressional action on a
tobacco bill is unlikely this year, and the makeup of the White
House and Congress after the fall election may determine any bill's
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I have talked to has said there are just not that
many legislative days left in session to get things down,'' Parrish
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a campaign issue, tobacco control traditionally has carried
little weight with voters. Still, Vice President Al Gore said
Tuesday that he favored regulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   And in a statement, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said he
advocated strict laws intended to prevent teen-agers from smoking
and added that ``tobacco regulation should be made by Congress and
state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   For cigarette makers, the problem is not only a legislative one
but a legal one.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while the gun producer Smith &AMP; Wesson averted some
legal woes by agreeing to change some product designs and business
practices to settle some lawsuits, the prospect of that option for
tobacco companies ranges from remote to nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, cigarette makers already have agreed to pay $246
billion to states over the next two decades to settle lawsuits
brought by state attorneys general seeking to recover health care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But that accord did not cover either cases brought by individual
smokers, like the one decided on Monday by the jury in San
Francisco. And more important, it did not cover class-action
lawsuits like the Florida case.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Florida case represents a group of smokers that may
include 300,000 people or more, some analysts have speculated that
an award of punitive damages against the industry this spring could
be astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal that award, producers may have to post a bond equal to
it. Faced with that option, some companies may choose to file for
bankruptcy, a step that would freeze all litigation against them,
several analysts and lawyers have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bond is high, many if not all of the tobacco companies
may not be in the position to post,'' John Coffee, a law professor
at Columbia University, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   That worst-case scenario, as industry officials refer to it, is
a small possibility. But it is real. Indeed, those who looked to
the Supreme Court for many years for the final word on the tobacco
industry's fate are making preparations in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies have persuaded several tobacco-producing
states to enact laws or consider proposals that would let them
appeal the Florida decision and protect assets like cigarette
plants from seizure if they are not able to post a bond.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who would see billions in settlement funds
imperiled if bankruptcies occurred, are also taking steps.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they are expected to hire a legal expert to represent
states as creditors in bankruptcy court. Just in case.

EUSTACHY WILL BE PREPARED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Eustachy likes to remind his Iowa State players, those who
will meet UCLA in the NCAA's Midwest Regional semifinal Thursday,
that they may be the worst judge of their own talents.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks from personal experience. As a guard at Arcadia High
School in the early '70s, he would watch taped-delay broadcasts of
Bruins games on KTLA and imagine himself playing at Pauley Pavilion
for John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a player in the country who didn't want to go to
UCLA,'' said the Iowa State coach, ``especially if you lived in Los
Angeles. I watched that team through its march to 10 titles. I
still get chills up my spine thinking about their tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is how close I was to playing for UCLA: I was a
non-scholarship player at Citrus College, the eighth man (on a JC
team). That's why I tell my kids not to evaluate themselves,
because I thought I should have been at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of pondering his dream, Eustachy did all of the
things necessary to make himself a good basketball coach. He
finished his career at Citrus, transferred to Long Beach State, and
earned a bachelor's degree in the credentialed P.E./coaching
program.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he moved to Belmont Shore and started taking classes
at L.B. State, he had put playing behind him. Tex Winter was the
49ers' coach then, and teams like Texas, Cincinnati, Oklahoma
State, Duke, North Carolina and Marquette were on the schedule. ``I
didn't even attempt to make the team,'' Eustachy said. ``I didn't
want the bad news of being cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Good player or not, Eustachy has developed into an excellent
coach. His current Cyclone team set a school record for wins in a
season (31), and one more win will put the school into its first
NCAA regional final since 1944, when it was an eight-team tourney
and the NIT was the big deal in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 seasons as a head coach, Eustachy has never had a losing
season. He had three winning seasons at Idaho, including a 24-8
mark in 1993, and five at Utah State, where he was Big West coach
of the year twice (1995, 1998) and took the Aggies to the 1998 NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Three coaches have been a major influence in Eustachy's life:
Neil Edwards, his Citrus coach who also gave him his first coaching
job; Tim Floyd, the Chicago Bulls coach who hired him at Idaho and
then recommended him for the Idaho and Iowa State jobs; and another
former coach, Bob Boyd, who hired him off a recommendation from
Edwards and also has a background with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd was the USC coach (1967-79) during eight of UCLA's 10 title
seasons. Boyd's Trojans handed UCLA its only loss in 1969 and one
of its two losses in 1970. His 1971 USC team went 24-2, with its
only two losses to the Bruins, but second-place teams didn't get
NCAA invitations back then.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd gave Eustachy his first Division I job as an unpaid
assistant on his 1981-82 Mississippi State staff. Floyd became a
grad assistant a year later and Boyd's top aide his third, but that
first year was memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy lived with Boyd in Starkville and worked as a waiter in
a seafood restaurant when he wasn't at practice. ``It was always
interesting when the players came in to eat,'' Eustachy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a true volunteer,'' Boyd said. ``We had an old southern
gentleman as athletic director, and he said I could have a
volunteer assistant as long as it doesn't cost the department one
cent. That's exactly the way he came.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I first noted about Larry is that he was a very good
teacher. I (immediately) felt comfortable assigning him a coaching
station. He had the ability to communicate and hold the attention
of the kids. As a recruiter, the kids were always comfortable
talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those early days, I think I was helpful. But his success
isn't happening by chance. He's responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Eustachy landed the Utah State job, he again reached out to
Boyd, then retired in Palm Springs, and hired him as an assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the world's oldest restricted-earnings coach,'' Boyd
said. ``It was a great deal for me. I wasn't doing anything at the
time, and I got a one-year contract at $1,000 a month, plus a place
to stay and insurance just for being there from mid-October to the
start of the tournaments. I used the insurance for angioplasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and his wife Betty will make the trip to Auburn Hills,
Michigan, to see the Iowa State- &QL; 
UCLA game. The only warning he would give UCLA is to expect to see
a better team than the Maryland squad the Bruins just humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any lobs Thursday,'' said Boyd of Iowa State.
``His team is very conscious of its responsibility. That's how they
win and stay in games. They get back on defense, guard you all the
time, and rebound. There's nothing complicated about what Larry
does. They just do all the important things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy isn't taking anything for granted, not his own team's
success to this point or UCLA's 11 losses prior to their current
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're playing as good as anyone,'' Eustachy said.
``If we don't play good transition defense, we could be out of the
game in the first five minutes. There isn't one thing where we can
say `do this and we'll win the game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It no longer may be Wooden on the sidelines and 10 titles in 12
years, but Eustachy knows a tingling spine when he feels one.

U.S.-CHINA TALKS CENTER ON STATUS OF TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs for rewriting and additional details, mainly to recast lede,

officials will visit China)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A senior U.S. official said Tuesday that in two days
of intensive talks, Chinese leaders had demonstrated a ``cautious
and prudent'' approach toward the new administration in Taiwan and
seemed anxious to explore what the election outcome meant for the
complicated relationship among China, the United States and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed that the next nine weeks are critical,'' said
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, adding
that there would be five cabinet-level officials visiting Beijing
in the space of a month.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's trip, which was planned before the election Saturday
of an independence-leaning candidate as Taiwan's new president, was
supposed to focus on the United Nations, and that was discussed for
several hours. But Holbrooke said that Chinese officials, who have
made few public comments on the election victory of Chen Shui-bian,
quickly turned the discussion to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese made it clear to us that the central issue in
Sino-U.S. relations from their point of view was Taiwan,'' said
Holbrooke, who was joined on the trip by Stanley Roth, the State
Department's top official on East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the Taiwan presidential campaign, China mounted a
menacing verbal campaign against Chen, and reiterated its position
that it would fight to block formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke on Tuesday praised the ``cautious and prudent
approach that the Chinese emphasized in their discussions'' with
his delegation, focusing on diplomatic rather than military
solutions. ``The Chinese are fully mindful of the historical
significance of what happened in Taiwan and that it is both an
opportunity and a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely mindful of the historical significance of
the phase we're in now, and so are we,'' he said. ``And this is
reflected in the intensification of contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke met with several senior Chinese officials, including
President Jiang Zemin, who extended a scheduled 30-minute meeting
to two and a half hours. The talks also touched on human rights,
China's entry to the World Trade Organization and normalizing
China's trade status. Holbrooke said the national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, will arrive next week to take up the discussions.

3 FIRMS INVEST $40 MILLION IN NEW YORK TIMES CO.'S DIGITAL UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co., which plans a public offering
of a new class of stock in its Internet business division this
spring, said Tuesday that three venture capital firms had invested
$40 million in the division, Times Company Digital.
</P>
<P>
   The investors are Flatiron Partners, Highland Capital Partners
and Chase Capital Partners, a unit of Chase Manhattan Bank. The
firms acquired three-year debt that will be convertible _ after the
offering _ into the Times Co.'s new Class C shares, which will
track the performance of Times Company Digital. Details about the
investment, including the interest rate to be paid on the debt and
the conversion price for the shares, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colonna, managing partner of Flatiron Partners, and Daniel
Nova, managing general partner of Highland Capital Partners, also
agreed to join a new advisory board for the digital division, The
Times Co. said. Other members of the board from outside the company
are Red Burns, the chairwoman of the interactive telecommunications
program at New York University, and Mark Walsh, the chief executive
of VerticalNet Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the advisory board from The Times Co. are Arthur
Sulzberger Jr., chairman; Russell T. Lewis, president and chief
executive; Howell Raines, editorial page editor of The New York
Times; and Martin A. Nisenholtz, the chief executive of the digital
division.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed a registration statement for the stock with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 28, but the offering
cannot be made until it is cleared by the SEC and approved by
shareholders at a meeting scheduled for April 27.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: TALKING TO THE SPITTOONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the road, throngs fought to get near John
McCain. In the deserted Senate chamber Tuesday, he gave a speech
about Kosovo to 99 empty mahogany desks and a few brass spittoons.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he was feeling nostalgic, or ``shmaltzy and overly
sentimental,'' as he put it, about his zany revolution and his
runaway bus.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as much fun excoriating the Washington establishment
when you're back in its bosom.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator told the press the time of his speech, but
did not give fellow senators much notice. He didn't even bring
along his ``bodyguards,'' as the handful of senators who supported
his campaign are known, despite the fact that they were all in his
office before the speech.
</P>
<P>
   He needed the imagery to be just right for his latest high-wire
act: He wants to return to the Republican fold but also keep his
distance and maintain his romantic image as the lonely rebel.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, his campaign aides _ John Weaver, Todd Harris and
Lanny Wiles _ looked down intently from the half-filled visitors'
gallery. McCain's speechwriter and co-author of his best-selling
Vietnam memoir, Mark Salter, sat behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Was this bland little address the kickoff for McCain 2004 or, as
it might be known, ``Speed 2''?
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be extremely tricky. ``It's important that I not
give the appearance of being just one of those guys who sounds good
on the campaign trail but then goes back to business as usual,'' he
said in an interview in his office.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not think ``the magic,'' the ``Wallenda high-wire
act'' of his ``happy band'' could be re-created. But he does not
want to behave in a way that will let down all the McCainiacs who
said to him: ``I was never involved before and I will never be
involved again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a fragile thing,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he does not want to be the vice president to the man
he referred to throughout the 30-minute interview merely as ``he.''
</P>
<P>
   Put aside the fact that McCain wants to ban the soft money that
W. is counting on to catapult him to the White House. Put aside the
lingering animosity about low Bush campaign tactics. (One of the
toughest moments of his campaign, McCain said, was not lashing out
at W.'s outrageous breast cancer ad: ``I had to keep a tight rein
on my emotions.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even put aside Bush's arrogant attitude toward McCain in a New
York Times interview, which the senator read in a fax version that
came to his thatched hut in Bora-Bora. ``I guess I was a bit
surprised,'' he said of W.'s comments.
</P>
<P>
   There is still another problem. ``I'm 63,'' the senator says,
wincing. ``I'll be 64 in August.'' If he were Bush's vice
president, he might be 71 by the time he got to run. ``Ronald
Reagan was an exception, but in general, I think guys that old
should be getting out of politics, not running for president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But if W. loses with another running mate _ ``There's Tom Ridge,
John Engler, Christie Whitman _ he should pick someone from a swing
state,'' McCain suggests brightly _ the party might turn in
desperation to their rebel.
</P>
<P>
   So the senator has cooled his rhetoric on campaign finance
reform for the moment, perhaps hoping to save it as an issue for
later.
</P>
<P>
   The iconic has turned ironic: after running an idealistic
campaign to curb the corrupting influence of money on American
politics, McCain will use his new cachet to try to inject more cash
into American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although he plans to keep fighting for campaign finance reform,
he is the GOP's new money magnet. Republicans who winced every time
he opened his mouth on the campaign trail are now salivating at the
prospect of having him headline their fund-raisers to raise money
so they can hold onto their majorities in Congress and further
thwart campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The high priest of lower spending is even forming a PAC, a
personal fund-raising machine, to round up bucks to get his
anti-money message across. He defends himself: ``I will campaign
for people but I won't have anything to do with soft-money
events.'' The PAC, he says, ``will help us formulate an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   And plugging a reform agenda in the coming years might come in
handy _ just in case the Wallendas have an encore.

MLS SCORES WITH GOALS, NOT YET WITH FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The debut of the 2000 season last weekend for Major League
Soccer wasn't 100 percent sparkling, but it seemed to help polish
off some tarnish the league has accumulated after four years.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the first game on the docket proved to be a
thriller, rekindling a fierce rivalry from last year's physical
playoff series between the Chicago Fire and the Burn. Just as it
did last season, the Burn refused to lose, dousing the Fire, 4-2,
Saturday in a game that included 47 total fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what I thought was probably one of the best opening
games in MLS,'' said MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis.
``It was a terrific game, and there were a lot of positives that
came out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bright spot were the debuts of the Fire's Bulgarian
standout Hristo Stoitchov and 17-year-old prodigy DaMarcus Beasley,
both among the influx of newcomers the league has high hopes for
this season. Stoitchov scored both of Chicago's goals, and Beasley
appeared to have no trouble adjusting to the physical level of MLS.
</P>
<P>
   That game helped boost the league average to 4.26 goals for the
four season openers. It's too early to speculate whether that
output will continue for 31 more games, but those are promising
early figures for keeping the offensive-minded fan base happy,
especially considering that the average goals-per-game for last
season was 2.86.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers don't make up for some others, namely an
average attendance of 14,571. That's on par for the season average
over the past three years, but less than last season's opening
average of 16,042 in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in line with what we expected,'' Gazidis said. ``It's
very early to be opening our season. It's what we tend to have with
games this early in March. Attendance has never been that high, but
we tend to build in early April and May.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's full slate of games should help, with the rematch
of MLS Cup '99 between defending champion D.C. United and the Los
Angeles Galaxy expected to be a big draw. There is also the
much-anticipated debut of German superstar Lothar Matthaus with the
MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the scope of this season, the perspective appears
cautiously optimistic for the future of the league. Word in Los
Angeles is that the Galaxy intends to build a 25,000-seat
soccer-specific stadium and training center for the men's and
women's national teams. In Chicago, Fire general manager Peter Wilt
has expressed interest in revamping Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   Those are significant developments because many believe the
future of soccer in the United States hinges on teams having their
own facilities. Currently, Columbus Crew Stadium is the only
soccer-specific stadium in the United States. GRAZIANI HONORED
</P>
<P>
   Burn forward Ariel Graziani picked up right where he left off
last season, scoring two goals in the Burn's 4-2 victory against
Chicago and earning MLS Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, who played with Ecuadorian select team Emelec during
the off-season, had four goals and one assist in eight games with
the Burn last season. WOUNDED RAPIDS
</P>
<P>
   Colorado won't be limping as heavily as it has throughout most
of the preseason when it comes to Dallas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids were hit hard by injury at the end of last year,
which Colorado woefully finished with a league-record 679 minutes
without a goal. And the roster was still black and blue for most of
the preseason. Five of 10 regular field starters missed Saturday's
season-opening loss against Los Angeles, but midfielders Anders
Limpar (hamstring) and Joey DiGiamarino (groin) could see their
first action of the season against the Burn in Saturday's 7:30 p.m.
match at the Cotton Bowl. THEY'RE G-R-R-REAT?
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's new home jersey and red shorts, which were unveiled
Saturday at the Cotton Bowl, come with a price: a smiling Tony the
Tiger logo on the front, as well as the Kellogg's logo spread
across the back.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg's has replaced AT&AMP;T as one of the league's major
corporate sponsors this season. But it's doubtful that a cheerful
cartoon Tiger on the front left corner of their shorts will have
many players saying how ``g-r-r-reat'' the new unis are. `STOICHOV'
GONE
</P>
<P>
   It seems the league has seen the last of Bulgarian international
Hristo Stoichov, one of MLS' marquee international players who made
his debut last week. But Hristo Stoitchov is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   At his request, Stoitchov added the second ``T'' to his name
last week, and the league honored his request on Monday. His name
was spelled without the ``T'' during the 1994 World Cup played in
the United States and during his peak years with Barcelona of the
Spanish first division. ZARCO BACK
</P>
<P>
   Burn defender Jorge Rodriguez, who had been one of two holdouts
in the league this season but returned last week, played the final
eight minutes in the Burn's season opener against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of Burn fans expressed support for Rodriguez with
signs that read ``Zarco,'' his nickname, which means ``green-eyed
one'' in Spanish. The supporters staged a small walkout at the
Cotton Bowl during the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Coach David Dir does not plan to start Rodriguez until he has
reached a negotiation regarding his contract with the league. HEAT
GETS NEW COACH
</P>
<P>
   The North Texas Heat, a Dallas-based women's semipro team, will
be coached this year by Jim Benedek. Benedek has played
professionally in several countries and was coach for SMU from 1974
to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, which won the Division II championship of the United
Soccer League's last season, opens its season Sunday, May 7,
against the Denver Diamonds.
SPOTLIGHT ON:
BURN COACH EMOTIONAL ABOUT HICKS' DEPARTURE
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Burn season kickoff luncheon turned surprisingly
sentimental when coach Dave Dir gave an emotional speech for
outgoing president and general manager Billy Hicks, who is leaving
to take a position with the World Wrestling Federation's startup
XFL.
</P>
<P>
   A comment from Hicks during his own speech gave some perspective
to the development of soccer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had mentioned to me, ``Isn't it risky to leave soccer
for football?''' said Hicks, who begins his new position Monday.''I
thought it really showed how far it has come here, that in Dallas,
Texas, somebody could use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has been the Burn's only general manager since the
league's inception in 1996 and was one of the initial figures in
bringing a soccer franchise to Dallas. Dir remains as the only MLS
coach still with the same team from his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hicks' departure) is really hard for me personally,'' Dir
said. ``People really don't know how we met or how this all came
about, but we had some grand plans for the league and for where
soccer is going. We had them when he came in, and, from that
standpoint, we wanted to bring a team to Dallas that would
encompass everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the league likes what it has seen of Dir's
contributions to that vision. He was expected to sign a three-year
contract this week.
</P>
<P>
   MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis said the league is not
rushing the decision on Hicks' successor. At this point, all three
of the Burn's vice presidents _ Paul Mott (operations and
administration), John Alper (sales) and Andy Swift (marketing and
broadcasting) _ have been recommended by Hicks as internal
candidates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CIREBON, Indonesia _ In Japan, a master of the Noh drama may be
declared a living national treasure and supported for life. In the
West, classical theater is fostered by government subsidies (though
leaner and meaner now than they used to be) and private
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Java, the world's most populous island and the political
and cultural center of Indonesia, the traditional drama still
mainly survives the way it has for centuries: by popular demand.
Itinerant puppeteers, known as dalangs, travel from village to
village, performing the ancient tales of gods and demons, heroes
and fools, for anyone with the wherewithal to hire them.
</P>
<P>
   In most cultures, puppets imitate human actors; in Java, the
reverse is true. The traditional dramas have always been performed
with puppets; indeed, the Indonesian word for puppet, wayang, is
used to denote the various forms of the drama. When a piece is
performed by people, for example, it is called the wayang orang _
literally, a human puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known form of drama in Java is the wayang kulit, the
shadow-puppet theater, performed with flat puppets made of leather
whose shadows are cast on a white cloth hanging between the
puppeteer and the audience. The wayang kulit remains a popular
entertainment throughout the island.
</P>
<P>
   Another form is the wayang golek, presented on a wooden stage
with three-dimensional rod puppets carved from wood and elaborately
painted and costumed. Its popularity has begun to decline as newer
forms of entertainment seduce young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   One regional variety of the wayang golek, the wayang cepak,
known for its distinctive style of puppet carving, is particularly
imperiled, although it has been performed continuously in the
countryside around the city of Cirebon in West Java for at least
700 years, and perhaps for centuries longer than that. Cirebon was
the seat of an ancient Islamic kingdom, and the region's culture is
distinct from that of the rest of the island.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Ann Kumar, a historian on the faculty of the
Australian National University in Canberra, commissioned a
performance of the wayang cepak, which was documented by a video
crew from the Lontar Foundation, a Jakarta-based group devoted to
preserving traditional Indonesian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wayang cepak,'' Kumar said, ``is one genre among many in a
rich theatrical tradition which is no longer flourishing as it once
did. The performers are getting older, many are dying, and this
endangers the continuity of the art form.''
</P>
<P>
   She paid the dalang, Warsad Darya, one of the most accomplished
of the surviving wayang cepak masters, his usual fee of $110 for
the customary six-hour extravaganza of dance and theater,
accompanied by a gamelan, a traditional orchestra of bamboo and
bronze percussion instruments, and a singer. Some famous dalangs
can command thousands of dollars, but in rural area around Cirebon,
where Warsad lives, the fee is a lot of money for most of his
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most performances of the wayang cepak serve a ritualistic
purpose, as the night's entertainment for a wedding or a boy's
circumcision, which in Muslim Java is a ceremony for pre-adolescent
boys, somewhat similar in religious significance to a confirmation
or bar mitzvah. This particular performance took place in Warsad's
workshop in the village of Gadingan, deep in the countryside of
West Java.
</P>
<P>
   The stage, a pair of stout banana trunks, was flanked by a
brilliant array of 130 puppets, all carved and painted by Warsad.
They were costumed in lustrous silk and satin, and adorned with
glittering spangles, bugles and beads. A fluorescent tube, mounted
on a beam overhead and shaded by a pink curtain, cast a soft light.
From the beam dangled offerings to the ancient pre-Muslim gods of
Java: pineapples, pumpkins, passion fruit, bottles of soda and
beer, cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   An evening of the wayang cepak begins at 9 o'clock. The puppet
drama is often preceded by a short dance performance. After a
clangorous overture by the gamelan, a 15-year-old girl came out in
front of the stage and impersonated several characters from the
wayang, wearing masks and scarves and moving with grace or
heavy-limbed power, as the character demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then Warsad, seated on the floor behind the stage, began to work
his magic; no other word suffices. The puppets floated across the
stage, their heads and arms manipulated from below by slender rods.
An aristocratic lady rushed into view, tossing her head fretfully
and flailing her arms as the dalang crooned her cry of distress.
Having said her piece, she was pinned to one of the banana trunks
by the point at the end of the puppet rod, her arms still raised
beseechingly.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome prince entered, striding purposefully, his virile,
confident voice offering her solace. The puppets were subtly lit by
the fluorescent light overhead and from below the stage. One by
one, the characters were introduced and planted in their places,
carrying on complex conversations, punctuated by songs, which
propel an enormously complicated plot.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dramas of the wayang are based on Javanese versions
of the great Hindu epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, relics
of the Majapahit empire that flourished in Java in the 14th
century. The drama that Kumar requested, however, is from a cycle
of indigenous Javanese legends about a mythical king named Panji,
from the pre-Muslim era. Kumar likens the Panji stories to the
British romances about King Arthur, peopled by larger-than-life
heroes who bravely triumph over all obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The version performed at Warsad's workshop was about Panji's
search for his true love, Candra Kirana, a picaresque tale in which
he encounters one vicissitude after another, involving many
disguises (frequently in cross-dress) and mistaken identities. As
in many national epics, the tale promotes correct religious and
ethical behavior as well as validating the hierarchical structure
of a feudal society and fostering respect for the aristocracy
embodied by the noble Panji.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible for scholars to say exactly how long the wayang
cepak versions of the Panji tales have been performed in the
Cirebon area, but the dramatic tradition is among the oldest
surviving in the world, contemporary with the mystery plays of
Europe and the Japanese Noh. The legends themselves are certainly
much older, dating as long ago as 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ThE Panji myth was exported throughout Southeast Asia. Kumar
said that Javanese immigrants carried the Panji tales as far away
as Japan, where, she believes, they became the basis of ``The Tale
of Genji'' by Lady Murasaki Shikibu. Kumar's views are
controversial, but she has marshaled evidence that she maintains
supports them.

REASONS ABOUND WHY MIHM WILL RETURN FOR SENIOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talked to a friend on the phone after I got back from Salt Lake
City. Like millions of others, he had watched a lot of basketball
on television during the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament.
But his first question was not about the games or a projection
about the Final Four or the eventual national champion.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Texas' junior center Chris Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he said, ``was that Chris Mihm's ride off into the
sunset?''
</P>
<P>
   Lot of opinions abound concerning Mihm's decision about whether
to return for his senior year. The subject is one of constant
debate among the writers who regularly cover the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   After Texas' underachieving loss to LSU in the second round of
the West Region, one regular changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a feeling,'' he said, believing Mihm would declare for
the June NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   I've got no more insight than he does. But my opinion more than
ever is that Mihm stays for a final season. I don't believe the
sunset that Mihm rode off into Saturday was the one of his
choosing. I don't believe that Chris wants the final impression of
his career to be that of LSU's Stromile Swift rejecting a
crunch-time shot in the lane. I don't believe Mihm is the kind of
guy who likes to leave a job unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   I might be wrong about how important any of that is to him, but
if he leaves, his collegiate career will remain an unfinished
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   UT coach Rick Barnes spoke in Salt Lake of the legacy that Mihm
could leave at Texas and for Texas high school basketball. Barnes
never says something without design, and those words linger in
connection with Mihm's understandably distended performance in the
final game of his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how fickle fans are, Texas' contingent will not look
favorably on Mihm if he bails out _ especially since his return,
when coupled with the addition of a scorer such as transfer Maurice
Evans, bodes favorably on the Longhorns' chances of again having
one of the Big 12's best teams next season, and a shot at making
some noise in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know this,'' Barnes said. ``If Chris comes back, he will
enjoy his senior season a lot more than he did this one, because no
one will be asking him all the time about his future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mihm or no, Barnes isn't backing off about his feelings
concerning the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a different team next year, no matter what
Chris does,'' Barnes said. ``But I want our fans to continue to get
excited about this program. I want to raise expectations. I'm
disappointed that we didn't go farther in the tournament this year,
but getting there is a great accomplishment no matter what people
say. It's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he wants the Longhorns to run more next year and
believes he will have the team to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Junior college point guard Fredie Williams likely will run the
attack with Darren Kelly and Evans playing more offensive roles.
Barnes hopes that Lawrence Williams will make the same kind of
progress that Will Clay did between his junior and senior seasons,
and that Roosevelt Brown can be a defensive stopper. Chris Owens
could be much better and even more of a force inside, where help is
on the way from Duncanville's 6-foot-9 forward Brian Boddicker,
6-10 center Jason Klotz of state-champion Klein Forest and 6-8 prep
school forward James Thomas. Brandon Mouton of Lafayette (La.) St.
Thomas More is a 6-5 swingman who could also add scoring punch.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Texas will play one of the nation's top schedules. The
Longhorns will be in the Preseason NIT. With two slots yet open,
they will play Illinois, Utah and Connecticut at home. Chances are
good that one of the two remaining openings will be filled by a
television deal, meaning another name opponent. Texas will also go
to Arizona next season, as well at playing an ESPN game at South
Florida and fulfilling the last game of the Houston series at
Hofheinz Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay good,'' Barnes promised. Without
qualification. nn

 CIREBON, Indonesia: supports them.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the drama's end, Warsad had 10 puppets sharing the stage,
Panji and Candra Kirana reunited and all the court rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Cohen, an American scholar of the wayang and a dalang
himself who has been living in Cirebon for eight years, said:
``Warsad is very smart, but illiterate, and I think that has helped
him to master the repertoire. He knows more than 100 dramas.
Literate dalangs are hindered in their command of the repertoire
because they try to stick with a set written version of the text,
whereas Warsad is more improvisatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Warsad, who is self-taught, has been supporting himself as a
puppeteer for 36 years, since he was 24. Before the performance,
his wife spread bamboo mats on the floor of their home and served
dinner to the assembled musicians and visitors. As he watched the
group fortify itself with fried chicken, vegetable soup and rice,
Warsad talked about his life as a dalang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty or thirty years ago, I performed as many as 150
performances a year,'' he said. ``In 1980 it began to decline. This
year I did 50.'' Warsad was referring to the fact that contemporary
forms of entertainment are superseding the wayang cepak theater in
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   A jaunty, compactly built man scarcely more than 5 feet tall, he
has the sunny countenance and self-confident air of an artist at
the top of his profession. ``It's in my nature to be a dalang,'' he
said. ``In the beginning, I had no teacher, no texts, no puppets. I
borrowed a set of puppets, and when the owner took them back, I
learned how to carve my own.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the puppets he uses in his own performances, he
also carves them to sell to collectors and other dalangs; he
estimates that he has carved, painted and costumed 2,000 puppets in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of income is the rental of a series of
fantastical, brilliantly colored carriages of mythological animals
for children, which he carved and painted a few years ago. Called
kereta, they are hired by families celebrating a ritual, a wedding
or, more often, a circumcision ceremony: the child and his friends
ride on the bizarre beasts, surrounded by puppet coachmen, pulled
through the village by horses.
</P>
<P>
   How is it that such an ancient, deep-rooted dramatic tradition
as the wayang cepak is in decline? Kumar said one reason it is
endangered is precisely because of the popular nature of the drama:
``There's a grass-roots interest in the theater here. It's not
patronized by rich people, and the artists are very much at the
mercy of the economy. After the crop failed here two years in a
row, there was a mass emigration to find work.''
</P>
<P>
   Warsad is one of the few people involved in the theater in the
Cirebon region who supports himself entirely by his work as a
performing artist; most of the members of his gamelan, for example,
are rice farmers or motorcycle-taxi drivers, who put in a full day
of work that begins a few hours after the end of the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The producer of the video, John McGlynn, who has lived in
Indonesia for 24 years and is a founder and director of the Lontar
Foundation, also blames the decline of the wayang cepak on the
island's inexorable urbanization. ``The theater is village-based,
and while its magic remains strong, the audience is dwindling,'' he
said. ``How do you keep the kids in the village after they've seen
the city lights? For young people who are working long hours in
sweatshops, malls and factories, discos, drugs and electronic
arcades provide a more visceral relief than does a slow-paced
wayang performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the competition comes from glamorous outside sources.
New forms of entertainment are developing in Java using traditional
idioms. Cohen, the American scholar, said the latest craze in
Cirebon is something called the organ tunggal, in which a
singer-dancer performs traditionally flavored numbers to the loud
accompaniment of a keyboard synthesizer _ rural Java's answer to
the lounge singer. Cohen said that enthusiasts of this new
entertainment sometimes become frenzied, and that fights break out.
</P>
<P>
   When Warsad's performance began, almost everyone in the village
turned out to see the dance and the beginning of the show, but an
hour or two later, most of the members of the audience were old
men. The young people had drifted to an impromptu gathering 100
yards down the lane. (It is only fair to point out, though, that a
cepak performance without a ritual connection _ a drama staged
simply to be videotaped by foreign scholars _ is perhaps something
that the people of Gadingan would not find compelling.)
</P>
<P>
   Warsad seemed undaunted. ``Two of my great-grandfathers were
dalangs,'' he said, ``but the intervening two generations were not.
I was urged by the people in the community to take up the wayang
cepak. It was considered a good thing to preserve the traditions of
our ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't hear him talking about the decline of the art: he is
too busy teaching the repertory to one of his sons.

<SLUG> BC-BKC-DUKE-BATTIER-HNS </SLUG>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Chris Kennedy is an associate athletic director in charge of
academic counseling for Duke athletes. When new student-athletes
come to Duke, Kennedy meets with them to make sure they are on the
right scholastic path at the prestigious university.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took only one day for Kennedy to realize he didn't have to
worry about Shane Battier.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy went home that night and received the typical, ``How was
your day?'' question from his wife, Ana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' Kennedy said. ``I just met a kid who is going
to be the president someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Battier is an impressive young man, whether he's leading the
Blue Devils to the Sweet 16, discussing the tenets of Buddhism (he
is a religion major) or giving his theories on the American
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane is an exceptional person,'' said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski. ``He has a dynamic personality, and he is very
disciplined. Once he sets his mind to accomplish something, he
devises a plan to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Battier, a 6-8 junior forward, made a plan before this season
began to help the top-ranked Blue Devils stay among the elite teams
in the nation, despite their losing four key players from last
season's team that lost to Connecticut in the NCAA championship
game. The plan appears to be working, because top-seeded Duke will
play Florida on Friday in the East Regional semifinals at Syracuse,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The key element to Battier's plan was to make himself more of an
offensive threat, which he has done this season by averaging 17.3
points per game. That's something the team didn't need from him
when it had offensive stars like Elton Brand and Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sad to see them go,'' Battier said. ``But at the same
time, I saw it as an opportunity to step out of my role-player
shadow. There really wasn't any epiphany. I just started to realize
I was as good as any of the guys in this program. That's why I came
to Duke _ to be a premier player.''
</P>
<P>
   Battier (pronounced BAT-tee-ay) also came to Duke because he
knew it would help him prepare for his future after basketball.
Some people have compared him to Bill Bradley, a former NBA star
and New Jersey senator whom Battier idolizes. Battier was
disappointed when Bradley dropped out of the presidential race
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great role model for me,'' Battier said. ``I've tried
to read as much about him as I could. Even when he was in high
school, you could tell he was destined for bigger things than
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has noticed the same thing in Battier. Bradley wrote
Battier a letter last spring, asking Battier if he would work for
Bradley on the campaign trail during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it,'' Battier said. ``But with everything I
was doing, it was going to take up too much of my time, and I
wouldn't be able to work on basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have done it. As a politician, Sen. Bradley has
tried to get the pulse of the American public, and he's the first
person in a long time that really has tried to tap into that pulse.
As a basketball player, he was very cerebral. He made himself a
great individual player by being the best team player he could
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Battier. He has made a point this
season of helping two freshman starters _ center Carlos Boozer and
point guard Jason Williams _ and two other freshmen who contribute
off the bench _ guard Mike Dunleavy Jr. and center Nick Horvath.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn things just being around Shane,'' Horvath said.
``You learn from all your teammates, but Shane is special because
of the way he carries himself and his maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Battier has stood out from the crowd for a long time, and it
wasn't because he was taller than everyone else. He grew up in
suburban Detroit and attended Country Day private school, making a
perfect score on the entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew early on that Shane was advanced,'' said Ed Battier,
Shane's father. ``But I don't think we did anything extra for him.
He always has surprised us.''
</P>
<P>
   One big surprise came last summer in Chicago while Shane was
working in the marketing department for McDonald's. He chose that
job over traveling with Bradley because it gave him more time to
practice basketball. His parents agreed, but they were stunned one
night when they saw him on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flipping channels, and there was Shane on WGN,'' Ed
Battier said. ``He was part of a panel discussion with Bill
Bradley, Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Battier admits he would love to follow Bradley's path _ Rhodes
scholar, NBA career, politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see myself in politics,'' Battier said. ``I think it
would be great to represent the people, but I think I have a very
idealistic view of government at this point. Hopefully, that won't
be corrupted. I really have no idea where life is going to take
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he hopes it takes him to a national championship, which
is four victories away. If Battier plays the way he did in a
victory over Kansas on Sunday, he might get his wish. Battier had a
career-high eight blocks, along with 21 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane Battier may be the most alert and aware defensive player
I've ever seen,'' said Kansas coach Roy Williams. ``And he can
guard any player, no matter what size that player is.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Basketball Coaches named Battier the
Defensive Player of the Year last season, an award he likely will
earn again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane is an amazing help-side defensive player,'' Krzyzewski
said. ``He moves as the ball moves, which enables him to make great
defensive plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Great defensive players have to constantly think ahead, which
Battier says sometimes can be a negative for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my biggest fault is I don't take enough time to enjoy
the moment,'' Battier said. ``I'm always looking toward the next
day rather than watching the sunset. I have a lot of plans for my
future, but if we win the championship, I'm going to sit back and
enjoy it.''

 &HT;    Carolina's Cota wants reason to smile
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ed Cota smiles. People have seen it. Though he
can win a staredown with Mount Rushmore, he's been known, on
occasion and with proper inducement, to crack one.
</P>
<P>
   When his North Carolina Tar Heels came back from a double-digit
deficit at home against Duke to nearly steal the basketball game,
there was Cota, placid as can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acts like that was expected,'' said teammate Kris Lang, the
talkative sophomore forward. ``Even if we win the national
championship, he might not crack a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely right,'' Cota said when told of Lang's
comments. ``That's the expectation I have of the team. I'm happy
for our freshmen and sophomores, who haven't been to a Final Four,
but I want to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, but I'm not happy. That comes from being there
before. My freshman year I might have been jumping for joy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Cota started at point guard for the Tar Heels, leading a
group that also had Antawn Jamison and NBA wunderkind Vince Carter
to the Final Four, where the Heels lost to Arizona in the
semifinals. The 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pounder from Brooklyn earned ACC
rookie-of-the-year honors that year and followed it with
second-team All-ACC honors his sophomore and junior years.
</P>
<P>
   Cota's senior season started on a down note when he and teammate
Terrence Newby were among four people charged with assault stemming
from an on-campus altercation following a Halloween party. The
trial date was delayed late last month, and the charge remains
pending.
</P>
<P>
   As the Heels stumbled to an 18-12 regular-season record and lost
in the first round of the ACC tournament to Wake Forest, they were
the focus of unbridled criticism by fans and media used to winning
and winning big. Cota was a frequent target, with critics
questioning his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay any attention to that,'' Cota said. ``I knew I was
doing a good job. Before the season everybody was hyping me up.
When things went bad, I had to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest criticism was that I wasn't a leader and Coach
(Bill) Guthridge was a good coach. That comes with a tough season.
People have to point fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's a great leader,'' Lang said of Cota.
``Everybody else does, too. Just because he's not vocal, doesn't
show a lot of emotion on his face, doesn't mean he's not a great
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Joseph Forte arrived on campus this year with
startling offensive skills but some uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed was a big influence on me,'' Forte said. ``He was always
talking with me, saying, `Joe, slow down. Joe, they're looking for
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Forte, though, couldn't get him to say much more: ``My big thing
when I came here was that I wanted to MAKE him talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cota finished the season strongly, notching double digits in
assists in three of the last five games. With 10 against Missouri
in a first-round South subregional game in Birmingham, Ala., on
Friday and seven in the second-round win over top-seeded Stanford
on Sunday, Cota pushed his career total to 1,010, making him only
the third NCAA Division I-A player to have more than 1,000. Bobby
Hurley of Duke and Chris Corchionne of North Carolina State are the
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anyone as accurate and creative as Cota,'' Wake
Forest Coach Dave Odom told The Charlotte Observer in early March.
``In terms of creativity, this kid stands alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be there in good times and bad,'' Cota said. ``I
did that.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From simmering tanks of high-level nuclear waste in
Washington State and plutonium laced with chemical poisons in Idaho
to production of radioactive gases in South Carolina, the federal
government's nuclear weapons program has festering technical and
environmental problems like no one else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With no easy way to solve them, the Energy Department has gone
to one of the few entities in the world with experience as broad as
its own: British Nuclear Fuels, part of the nuclear power and
weapons agency of the British government, now spun off as a
government-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   But as the British company now known as BNFL prepares to tackle
the American problems, an embarrassing lapse has surfaced back home
in its core business, which is producing plutonium fuel. British
government inspectors reported in February that for months,
employees who were supposed to be performing a final measurement of
fuel pellets bound for Japanese reactors were instead copying
numbers from previous shipments. BNFL executives said workers felt
the work was boring and a crew on the night shift had apparently
found it easier to falsify the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the company's business practices is now affecting
the company's contracts with the U.S. government. Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson, in a telephone interview from Algeria, where he is
meeting OPEC ministers, said he had ordered his department to send
a team to England to meet with British investigators. ``We are now
placing BNFL under extra scrutiny because of these problems,'' he
said. ``I have been uneasy about some of their operations in the
U.S. If we uncover anything, I will take swift and strong action.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Business as usual is over with BNFL and with all our
contractors, but especially with BNFL.'' The situation, Richardson
said, was ``itching for stronger management review.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the incident with the pellets was an isolated
problem. ``We feel very badly about the pellets,'' said David R.
Bonser, a director of the government-owned company, and head of
waste management and decommissioning. He said it was a problem
caused by ``a handful of people in one of the plants who did things
they absolutely should not have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's nuclear installations inspectorate, however, rejected
that defense. ``Although various individuals were at fault, a
systematic failure allowed it to happen,'' the report, published in
February, said. ``In a plant with the proper safety culture, the
events described in this report could not have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Taylor, the company's chief executive, has resigned, but
the company's problems continue. Sellafield, the plant on the west
coast of England where the fuel was made, was never popular with
neighbors: for years it has dumped radioactive waste into the Irish
Sea; English anti-nuclear advocates and the Irish government would
like it shut, and the British government reported that pigeons in
the area had become radioactive from the plant's emissions. But now
the problem is not just with neighbors, but with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Japan asked the British company to take back the fuel, although
the company insists that two automatic systems measured the pellets
and found their diameter to be within specifications. A German
utility, PreussenElektra AG, shut a reactor running on the fuel
that was not properly measured, and asked for compensation; Germany
also suspended imports of additional fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Well before its fuel problem at Sellafield, however, it was
clear to leaders of the British company that the future
profitability of that business was uncertain. As a result, they
moved decisively into the United States. With an American partner,
the Morrison Knudson Corp., the company acquired many assets of the
old Westinghouse Corp., which had been a major Energy Department
contractor; it also bid directly on Energy Department work at Oak
Ridge, Tenn., and Hanford, in Washington State. And it has hired
several former Energy Department officials, including one who
approved giving a contract to BNFL without making the company take
part in a fully competitive bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford contract, which involves solidifying liquid nuclear
wastes in glass, is expected to take decades and cost tens of
billions of dollars. At Hanford, it hired the Energy Department's
former site manager, one of four high-ranking Energy Department
officials now on its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a coalition of American groups that has been pressing
the Energy Department for years to clean up its nation-wide
archipelago of weapons facilities plan to file a petition with the
department on Thursday urging that BNFL be barred from government
contracts, for lack of integrity and competence. ``We think clearly
a case can be made, and that the case is self-evident, that this is
a company that does not possess those qualities,'' said Thomas
Carpenter, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project, in
Seattle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The problem is serious for the Energy Department, critics say,
because its track record on overseeing its contractors is
particularly poor. No evidence of wrongdoing has been found in
BNFL's American operations. But at Rocky Flats, near Denver, where
a BNFL subsidiary works in plutonium clean-up, a prior contractor
committed five felony violations of environmental laws with no
apparent notice from the department, which owned the plant. At
Savannah River, where the company is now involved with the plant
that refuels hydrogen bombs with a radioactive form of hydrogen
gas, a prior contractor's list of 30 reactor accidents over the
years came as a complete surprise to top Energy Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under Richardson, the department has put special emphasis on
improving its oversight, but in January of this year a report by
its own inspector general complained that at Hanford, where BNFL
has been selected for the largest environmental cleanup in the
country, the department lacked the personnel, plans and other
management tools needed to oversee the project. Without those
plans, the inspector general warned, ``the Department may be unable
to control, predict, explain, or defend future changes to cost and
schedule.'' The cost estimate is now $47 billion, up from an
estimate of $30 billion to $38 billion in 1996. The company's
portion would be $6.8 billion to $10 billion, by current estimates.
A decision on a contract is supposed to be made by August.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, outside groups that have followed the Energy
Department's clean-up efforts for years now say that the company
has taken on other jobs for the department in areas in which it has
no special qualifications. For example, in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the
department has enormous derelict factories that it formerly used to
enrich uranium for reactor and weapons fuel, and which it would
like to release for private industrial use. Foregoing bidding, the
Energy Department gave BNFL a $238 million contract in 1997 based
on the idea that it had done similar work at Capenhurst, in
England. The department relied on a contracting system called
``other than full and open competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department reported to Congress that it wanted BNFL
because of ``efficiencies in the approach to recycle and building
decontamination based on the company's successful experiences at
Capbenhurst.'' A key point for the Energy Department was the
ability to decontaminate tons of nickel, a valuable metal that was
used in the enrichment process.
</P>
<P>
   But the company did not do that work at Capenhurst; the nickel
there is still contaminated. And the system it proposed to use for
decontamination of nickel at Oak Ridge is now the subject of a
patent dispute between its American inventor and the Energy
Department. In a suit brought by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers International Union against the plan, a federal district
court judge in Washington described the process as ``entirely
experimental.'' Because of uncertainty about what standards should
apply, the department has dropped plans, for now at least, to sell
the nickel on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The contracting officer for the Energy Department who approved
``other than full and open competition'' later went to work for
BNFL. So did the former manager of the Hanford site, who is now an
executive vice president at an American subsidiary of the company,
and so did the former manager of the Energy Department's Idaho
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, where BNFL won a contract
to build an incinerator for plutonium mixed with hazardous
chemicals not far from Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're swallowing fairly important and influential executives
right and left,'' said Carpenter of the Government Accountability
Project. Energy Department officials said that none of the
officials had violated any conflict-of-interest rules.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL's problems at Sellafield have produced ammunition for a
group opposed to the incinerator, Keep Yellowstone Nuclear Free, as
they have for other critics around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable,'' said Tom Patricelli, the group's
executive director, ``that the United States government would allow
a foreign corporation surrounded by such scandal and turmoil to
build a first-of-its-kind incinerator on American soil, so close to
the crown jewel of our national park system.''

GIULIANI ASSERTS THAT MRS. CLINTON PROJECTS HER VIEW ON SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER and ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday that Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who has accused the mayor of racially polarizing
New York City, was projecting her own feelings onto him. The
mayor's assertion came as the police shooting death of an unarmed
black man, Patrick Dorismond, reverberated through City Hall and
the state Legislature and into the U.S. Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a process called projection in psychology,'' Giuliani
said at a City Hall news conference. ``It means accusing someone of
what you're doing. That is precisely what Mrs. Clinton is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that Clinton's remarks criticizing him at the
Bethel AME Church in Harlem on Monday night were ``tantamount to a
speech at a political convention'' and that she was ``reading from
a script provided by Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he felt no responsibility to reach out to the
black community because ``the three officers were Hispanic'' and
``there's no indication that this had anything to do with race.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also angrily stepped up his attacks on Dorismond, who
was killed during an altercation with the police on Thursday night,
by further suggesting that Dorismond's previous behavior _
including a fight with his girlfriend this month _ may have been a
factor in his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he died is ultimately the thing that matters,'' said
Giuliani, who is running against Clinton for the Senate and at
times sounded like the prosecutor he once was. ``Was he the cause
of it, or was the police officer the cause of it? Did he lunge at
the police officer? Did he start the altercation? Did he act in the
way in which he acted on three or four other occasions? Was he
acting similar to the way he acted on March 7, when he punched his
girlfriend in the face, even though she had his 1-year-old in her
arms?''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Giuliani held up for the cameras the police
complaint that Dorismond's girlfriend, Karen Sturkey, had filed
against him on March 8. Sturkey contended that Dorismond had struck
her in the head and cursed at her during an argument about their
1-year-old daughter, Destiny. The city's corporation counsel,
Michael Hess, has said the police took no action in the case, which
was closed. Last week, Sturkey, 22, said Dorismond ``was a good
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded Tuesday to the mayor's remarks with scorn,
declaring after a town hall meeting on Long Island that Giuliani
had acted unethically in releasing Dorismond's juvenile arrest
record, an action that has enraged Democrats and the Republican
mayor's critics, who say the action was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also drew a distinction between her earlier statement
about the ``murder'' of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed black man who
was fatally shot by four undercover police officers last year in
the Bronx, and the mayor's present behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a misstatement and I apologized,'' Clinton said. ``One
of the differences between the mayor and me is that I actually
admit that I'm a human being who occasionally makes mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Giuliani's actions were ``part of a pattern of
hunkering down, of getting angry, of lashing out, of dividing
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And to me,'' she said, ``it represents the kind of leadership
style that is not effective these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as both candidates said the Senate race was
not a factor in their high-profile statements over Dorismond's
death in the last five days. But aides to both candidates were
privately measuring the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said the incident underlined her continuing
attempt to portray Giuliani as erratic, divisive and
temperamentally unsuited for a collegial body like the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's political aides said they hoped that it would
reinforce Giuliani's image as a strong law enforcer but
acknowledged that they could not control him and that his
statements were not something that they had advised him to make.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's death was also a focus Tuesday in Albany, where the
Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, called the mayor's actions
``egregious'' and ``reprehensible'' at a news conference with 40
other Assembly Democrats, most of them from New York City. Silver
said that the mayor had violated state law by authorizing the
release of Dorismond's juvenile record and that two Assembly
committees, judiciary and codes, would begin an investigation into
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said at his news conference that releasing the court
records was legal because Dorismond was dead. ``Privacy interests
and rights expire with you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University's
Law School, called Giuliani's statement ``ridiculous'' and said the
Family Court Act, passed by the state Legislature in 1982, stated
clearly that only a judge could decide if juvenile court records
might be released. ``It passed the law with no exception and the
mayor has no power to create one for his own purposes,'' Gillers
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani's view was supported later at a hastily called news
conference in a corridor of City Hall by Hess, Deputy Mayor Joseph
J. Lhota; the first deputy police commissioner, Patrick E.
Kelleher; and Steven M. Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides held the news conference in response to Silver,
who they said was acting to further the political interests of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota, who is Giuliani's second in command and oversees the
day-to-day operations of the city, rarely speaks out about
politics, but Tuesday he said Silver ``wants to be the marionette
of someone like the Rev. Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Giuliani had left City Hall for a fund-raiser in
Rhode Island for his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor's political opponents have furiously
condemned him for what they said was his demonization of Dorismond,
their voices seemed only to intensify his language Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Giuliani also assailed reporters for
what he said was their ``knee-jerk'' predilection to blame the
police and highlight the disciplinary record of Anthony Vasquez,
the plainclothes detective who shot Dorismond.

BOY WHO HAD ARM RIPPED OFF BY TIGER ON RIGHT PATH TO RECOVERY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ark.) 
 
By LISA TEACHEY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Jayton Tidwell, the 4-year-old Arkansas boy whose arm
was surgically reattached after being ripped off by a pet tiger,
has passed the second hurdle in his recovery, staving off possible
life-threatening infections, doctors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His surgical team at Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital now
speculates the boy's arm may have been severed by the tiger's paw.
Initially, they thought the 400-pound tiger had bitten the boy
after the child stuck his arm in its cage last Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jayton's doing fantastic right now,'' said Dr. Mark Henry, one
of the doctor's who performed the procedure last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the limb on to stay on? Yes it is,'' Henry said. ``Is the
limb on without infection? Yes it is. His arm is on and it's going
to be staying on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jayton may need further surgeries to improve muscle
function and the appearance of his arm, Henry said, this injury
should not be a long-term handicap for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The boy passed the first milestone within hours of the
reattachment surgery when blood circulation was restored to his
severed arm.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Jayton remained on a ventilator because his vocal
chords and throat were swollen. But he was awake.
</P>
<P>
   Jayton's right arm remains in a splint and he has no movement or
sensation in it, Henry said. Over the next six months the nerves
should begin growing and then doctors will be able to determine if
the level of function in the arm is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If not, another surgery will be performed where muscles from his
legs will be transplanted to his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said the child could be functioning normally in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His final reconstructive results should enable him to go out
and to participate in any activity whether it's artistic or
athletic or otherwise,'' Henry said. ``The exact way in which he
carries out that participation will undoubtedly not be exactly the
same as his peers. But he should not be excluded from anything
based on this injury.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure exactly how Jayton was injured. Jayton, who lives
in Arkansas, was spending spring break with his father in Brazoria
County. The accident happened when they went to visit relatives in
the Channelview area to see the tiger Jayton's uncle, Larry
Tidwell, had caged in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   While the family gathered for pictures in the living room,
Jayton apparently slipped outside and stuck his hand in the tiger's
cage.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County regulations do not prohibit ownership of wild pets
as long as the cage has a permit from the county. Larry Tidwell's
tiger cage did not, and he was fined $500 for the misdemeanor
violation and ordered to make minor changes to the cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our suspicion that in review that the arm was probably
not bitten off. But it was probably swatted off with a single
stroke of the paw,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.2 million
people and is the largest county in Texas. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; There were no clearly identifiable teeth marks where the limb
was severed so it was hard to tell exactly what happened, Henry
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the accident, Harris County Commissioners Court
asked the county attorney's office and the Animal Control Division
Tuesday to review the county's 2-year-old exotic animal guidelines
in an attempt to ban all exotic animals within 1,000 feet of a
residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we ought to get them out of residential areas,''
County Judge Robert Eckels said after Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Eckels said he expects the county's animal control director,
Dawn Blackmar, and Assistant County Attorney Roberta Lloyd, to
return to Commissioners Court in about a month with recommendations
on how to strengthen the exotic animal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Henry estimated Jayton's medical expenses, including
rehabilitation, could exceed $500,000. Henry said he would treat
the child without pay but did not know if other doctors and
therapists would.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The family has set up two funds to cover the medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   The first is at a local bank: Jayton Tidwell Fund c/o Southwest
Bank of Texas, P.O. Box 27459, Houston, 77027-27549, account number

ADVERTISING: IMAGE FIRM CREATING NEW IDENTITY FOR ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: in references to d/g(ASTERISK), please replace (ASTERISK)
with the typographical symbol, no parentheses)  
(bl) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A low-profile international design and image firm,
Desgrippes Gobe &AMP; Associates, which has high-profile clients like
Air France, Coca-Cola and The Limited, is creating a new identity
for a client it has known forever: itself.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old, 165-person agency, which had $25 million in
revenue last year, will be renamed d/g(ASTERISK) (the asterisk
represents a star) effective April 4 as part of a campaign to
heighten awareness of the agency's services.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has headquarters in Paris and New York and
offices in Brussels, Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, has also created
a logo made up of four symbols that represent its disciplines: a
star represents its marketing and design expertise; a bull's eye
with the letter ``C'' at the center represents the firm's
consulting practice; a building represents its architectural
expertise; and an eye represents its interactive capabilities. The
campaign also includes a redesigned Web site at www.dga.com.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Gobe, president of the New York office, said Desgrippes
Gobe had decided to rename itself because it found that although
its original name ``reflected the identity of the founding
designers, it was not always easy to pronounce or remember.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also failed to communicate our evolution into an
international organization and our capabilities,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Central to d/g(ASTERISK)'s work is its concept of emotional
branding, which involves analyzing the visual and emotional
responses a good or service generates. For a brand to be
successful, it believes an emotional bond must be developed between
the buyer and the product. The agency uses its research to develop
strategies that clarify or solidify the images of its clients'
brands, which strengthen that bond.
</P>
<P>
   Companies whose brands d/g(ASTERISK) has helped revamp include
Brooks Brothers, Reebok, Intimate Brands' Victoria's Secret and
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. Ann Taylor hired the agency to design its
flagship store in Manhattan; among d/g(ASTERISK)'s innovations were
a dressing room fitted with business equipment and a central
staircase in the front of the store, designed to create a home-like
feeling. In addition, d/g(ASTERISK) has done more traditional image
consulting for companies like Coca-Cola. During the Atlanta
Olympics, it designed a can for Coke that featured the word
``always'' in five languages.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agency's newest image consulting clients is Ohio
State University, for which it is developing a vision for a
university of the future. And it is coming up with a new identity
for Air France, involving aircraft interiors, uniforms and redesign
of the airline's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Branding is also central to d/g(ASTERISK)'s interactive
strategy. Gobe, for one, expects the Internet-driven economy
ultimately will be driven by brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will be empowered to make their own decisions, set
their own price, design their own product,'' he said. ``They'll be
able to create or break the reputation of a company, through chat
rooms, in just five minutes. Word of mouth will become global, not
local.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there was a delay between the introduction of a
product and consumers' response to it,'' Gobe added. ``Now
companies will get immediate feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Levine, who heads up the agency's consulting practice,
said the four main elements of traditional offline retailing today
are entertainment, information, personal service and ease; he
suggested all four will ultimately have to be ``reconfigured and
translated for the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   When this occurs, he predicted ``bricks-and-mortar retailers
will have to raise the bar as well, to make the live shopping
experience more special.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's branding theories, particularly as they apply to
the Internet, generally won the support of Clive Chajet, a New
York-based consultant who was once chairman of Lippincott &AMP;
Margulies, a leading brand and corporate identity firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the future on the Internet belongs to
established, recognized brands because the transaction between the
seller and buyer will be direct,'' he said. ``There will be no
sales person telling you how wonderful the product is. So all
products will have to be presold. Brands will be known and
understood for what they offer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jim Nail, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., questioned d/g(ASTERISK)'s emphasis on emotions
in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, brands on the Web are all about how quick and easy it
is for a consumer to find what he's looking for; d/g(ASTERISK) is
going about it backward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offline, you can't deliver an experience to someone until they
walk through the door of your store,'' he added. ``Emotional
branding is used to try to draw people to the store in expectation
of delivery of the brand's promise. But online, the delivery of
that promise is one click away. So the emphasis has to be on
delivering that satisfying experience first. Out of that experience
comes the emotional connection to the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Chajet questioned d/g(ASTERISK)'s decision to change its name to
initials, eliminating the names of its two founders. ``Adopting
initials as a corporate name is a passport to anonymity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger van den Bergh, a New York-based designer specializing in
corporate and brand identity, also called this move risky because
``in their 29 years in business, everyone knows them as Desgrippes
Gobe. I'm not sure this will help their long-term name
recognition.''

WHAT'S LEFT FOR LAKERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A season chock full of highs and notably short on
lows has left the Los Angeles Lakers to once again manufacture
challenges for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They returned home Tuesday having gone 4-1 on their last
significant road trip of the season; having won 22 of their past 23
games; having beaten two of the top teams in the East (New York,
Miami); and having improved their record on the second night of
back-to-backs to 19-1.
</P>
<P>
   With their sights firmly set on the NBA Finals, the Lakers also
improved to 4-1 against the East's top three teams _ the Pacers,
Knicks and Heat.
</P>
<P>
   What to do for an encore? With 14 games left, the Lakers realize
finding new challenges is an ongoing effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be,'' Rick Fox said. ``You know, at certain times
this year we've been our (own) biggest challenge, and we've
responded to it. Outside of the Washington game, I can't see an
opportunity where we let ourselves down. We go home, and no more
big road trips to be challenged with, but a couple teams we're
going to have to beat to go anywhere in this league out of the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is relatively friendly, with eight home games and
six on the road. But 10 of the 14 opponents are playoff-bound, and
the Lakers will find a few more statement games.
</P>
<P>
   They have road dates at Sacramento and San Antonio _ two places
they haven't won this season, against their potential first and
second-round opponents. They'll also play host to the Knicks, their
possible Finals opponent, and try for the season sweep.
</P>
<P>
   They also have a pair of games against Phoenix and one each
against Seattle and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   If form holds, the Lakers (56-12) will finish with 67 or 68
wins, which would be second best in franchise history, behind only
the 69-13 record posted by the 1971-72 team that won the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The goal now, Fox said, is ``re-establishment of our strength
and our play of the whole season, re-establishing that with the
rest of the season here, the remaining teams that we'll face will
be playoff teams in a lot of cases, and setting a tone that we want
to be playing even better ball than we've been playing going into
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Amplified: The Lakers got their first experience with the NBA's
use of boom microphones near the bench Sunday in New York. Coach
Phil Jackson is still opposed to the idea _ and at times had
assistant Jim Cleamons shoo away the mike man _ but generally felt
``it went all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an intrusion, there's no doubt about it,'' Jackson
said. ``We didn't talk as much as perhaps we would have talked if
we had the freedom. A lot of stuff I write out on the (dry-erase)
boards anyway, so I just pointed to it and said, `We're going to
run that the next time down.' ... So the guys got the idea.''

HOLD THE PHONE. BETTER YET, BLOW IT TO SMITHEREENS.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The season's final performance of Strauss's
``Rosenkavalier'' at the Metropolitan Opera last month was one of
those inspired evenings when everything goes beautifully for
reasons no one can explain. The principals sang splendidly: Susan
Graham as Octavian, Heidi Grant Murphy as Sophie, and Renee
Fleming, who brought her poignant voice and subtle intensity to the
role of the Marschallin.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the last scene, came the almost inevitable disruption:
a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ms. Fleming began the sublime opening melody of the
great final trio; just as, comforted by the shimmering sound of the
orchestra, she floated her voice to a soft high B flat on the word
``lieb'' (``beloved''); just as she was taking listeners to a
transcendent place that was, in fact, painfully deep within each of
us, a cell phone belonging to someone in a pricey seat rang. In an
instant, the intrusive jangle dragged us right back to reality:
another winter's night in New York, where oblivious people go to
the opera. Soon we would have to deal with slush and subways,
arrive home and think about the next day's work.
</P>
<P>
   From what seemed the darting of her eyes, Ms. Fleming heard that
jarring sustained ring. If she had stopped singing, signaled James
Levine in the orchestra pit to halt the performance and asked the
owner of that phone to take the call in the lobby, most of us would
have applauded. Instead, she redoubled her concentration and kept
on singing, gloriously.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, a critic feels compelled to write a crabby
column about the rudeness of audience members. Such columns seldom
do much good, but at least the critic feels better. The traditional
disruptions, like coughing, will always be with us. But although
colds afflict us all, the kind of unabashed hacking that you hear
from people who don't even seem to be trying to control themselves
has to be a passive-aggressive expression of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Some irritants are particularly exasperating because they are so
preventable. Why would a woman choose to adorn her wrist with a
clinking set of bracelets when she goes to the opera, so that every
time she fidgets in her seat or tinkers with her Met Titles she
becomes a human wind chime?
</P>
<P>
   Crinkling plastic bags drive me nuts. People, presumably music
lovers, show up fresh from shopping and settle into their seats
with plastic bags full of goodies, often CDs. They place the bags
on their laps and blithely lay their hands on top of them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't they hear the rustling that results every time they shift
positions? If some day one of you bag clingers is seated near Row L
at the Met and a tall guy with thinning brown hair approaches
before the opera to ask that you please place your plastic bag
beneath your seat, it's me.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone represents a new level of intrusiveness. So far
this season, it has been the rare concert or opera I've attended
during which at least one didn't ring. Two went off, a few rings
each, during the soprano Barbara Bonney's lovely recital at Alice
Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at Carnegie Hall, as the tenor Ian Bostridge sang
Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings with Neville
Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a cell phone
rang forth playing the first notes of Mozart's G minor Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   I think the reason people forget to turn the things off (and you
can only assume that no one leaves them on intentionally) is that
we are getting hooked on feeling reachable at all times, in case
something comes along that might be a tiny bit more interesting
than whatever we are doing just now.
</P>
<P>
   Every day you see more and more people on the street having cell
phone chats as they walk. So much for just strolling, for being
silently present amid the vibrant urban busyness.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any place to detach ourselves from the electronic
network we are wired into, to take an exit from the information
superhighway, it's the opera house and the concert hall. There, for
a few precious hours, you can leave the rest of your life on the
other side of the closed lobby door and enjoy the natural sound of
great live music.
</P>
<P>
   You know that a problem has become pervasive when television
commercials start poking fun at it. A new one depicts a
chesty-voiced Brunnhilde in helmet and breastplate who, outraged by
the interruption of a cell phone, stops singing and heaves her
spear at the offender, zapping his phone to bits. In the next
scene, another operagoer has a new two-way pager with a silent
keypad, which allows him to ``stay in touch without disturbing
anyone.'' The depressing assumption behind the pitch is that
staying in touch while attending the opera is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? The last two times I attended concerts at
Alice Tully Hall, an official appeared onstage before the
performance to remind us to turn off beepers and cell phones. Both
times, the announcement was greeted with supportive applause. Both
times, cell phones went off, each time during the second half of
the concert, suggesting that the owners had used their phones
during intermission and forgotten to turn them off again.
</P>
<P>
   What next? Metal detectors? A rule requiring cell phones to be
checked in the lobby? A vigilant Brunnhilde at every event with her
spear readied for ambush? I say, whatever it takes.
</P>

ATTORNEYS TO APPEAL JUDGE'S RULING IN CUBAN BOY'S CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (sub for minor editing) 
 
By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorneys for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez filed a notice of appeal
hours after a Miami federal judge Tuesday paved the way for the boy
to be reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A quick, two-line notice of appeal was filed late Tuesday with
the 11th U.S. Circuit of Appeals Court, said Linda Osberg-Braun, an
attorney for the Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   She said the appeal was filed to stop U.S. immigration officials
from taking the boy from his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, with
whom the boy has been living since his rescue off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., four months ago. Elian was found floating on an
inner-tube on Thanksgiving Day after an ill-fated boat journey from
Cuba that took his mother's life. Elian was among three survivors
on a boat that capsized
</P>
<P>
   ``We're communicating with the (U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service) directly, and we're very hopeful that they
will respect Elian's appeal rights,'' Osberg-Braun said. ``They
have not confirmed one way or another what they intend to do or
will intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore
upheld a decision by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to return
Elian to his father, Juan Gonzalez. Moore ruled that only the U.S.
attorney general can grant political asylum to keep the boy in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the boy's Miami family had argued that the federal
agency had unjustly denied Elian his right to apply for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the court has sustained our judgment that
Elian should be reunited with his father. The court's decision
reaffirms our position that only Elian's father can speak for his
son on federal immigration matters,'' U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   How or when the reunification takes place, however, remains
unclear. When pressed, Reno would say only that federal authorities
will move promptly to return the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what will happen, except that we're going to
review the matter with the U.S. attorney's office, with the Miami
office of immigration and naturalization and with every one here to
plan how we may orderly achieve this reunification in an orderly
way,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department and INS officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to play this out publicly. We're just not,''
said Carole Florman, Justice Department spokeswoman. ``These are
not details that we feel ought to be shared with the general public
at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling was the latest turn in a four-month political
and international tug-of-war between Elian's family in Cuba and his
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban-exile community has rallied around Elian, lifting
him as a symbol of hard-fought freedom, whose mother died in a
desperate attempt to provide a better life for her son in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, President Fidel Castro has organized massive
demonstrations demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   Though Elian's supporters in Miami have questioned the sincerity
of his father's claims in light of his refusal to come to the
United to retrieve the boy, Gonzalez has called the boy almost
daily from Cuba, where he works at a resort hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez has derailed attempts by family members in
Miami to seek political asylum for the boy by demanding that those
applications be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The INS decision to return the boy was based on two interviews
by an INS officer with Juan Gonzalez in December. As a result of
the meetings, the INS determined that Gonzalez was a fit father who
had maintained a relationship with his son after his separation
from the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing his ruling, Moore said Elian's great uncle Lazaro had
the right to seek legal action on the boy's behalf and that the
court had limited jurisdiction in the case. He also stated that
Elian's attorneys could proceed with the lawsuit to determine if
the INS violated the boy's right to due process.
</P>
<P>
   A state court hearing to determine custody for the boy is
pending. On Jan. 10, a Florida state court granted Lazaro Gonzalez
limited legal authority.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg-Braun said the state court remains an option, but hopes
the appeal negates the need to go that route.
</P>
<P>
   However, George Martinez, a federal law expert and law professor
at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Elian's attorneys
no longer have the option of a state court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal law is supreme and a state court cannot contradict a
federal court on that issue,'' Martinez said. ``The state court
should be pre-empted by the federal court decision.''
</P>
<P>
   For supporters of Elian's family in Cuba, news of the ruling
came as a relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of the
Churches of Christ in the USA, a New York-based group that has been
working with Elian's family in Cuba, said he was ``delighted, but
not surprised'' by the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish it had come sooner. Elian should have been home
before Christmas,'' he said. ``If a parent is loving, caring and
not abusive, a child should be with his or her parent, and Juan
Miguel Gonzalez is a loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush issued a short
statement from his campaign headquarters in Austin, Texas, saying
the true wishes of Elian's father are still unclear. The elder
Gonzalez should be allowed to come to the United States to speak
his mind, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge Attorney General Janet Reno to reconsider her plans to
send Elian back to Cuba, back to the place his mother died trying
to escape,'' the Texas governor said. ``This case should be decided
by a Florida family court, which will protect the best interests of
Elian, not by a Clinton-Gore Justice Department whose record of
putting politics ahead of the law does not inspire confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in New York City, Vice President Al Gore, the
expected Democratic presidential nominee, said, ``I think that what
we still need is a full and fair court hearing based on due process
where all parties can present the facts.``
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the ``father is not free to speak his true
mind,'' and said ``This child should never have been put in a
position where the choice was between freedom or his father ...The
real fault here lies with Fidel Castro.``

SOME PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONDOMS, TO GET STATE TAX BREAK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The 39-year-old state sales tax on
nonprescription drugs will become extinct Saturday, a change that
could save Texas shoppers an estimated $161 million a year when
they buy items such as cough syrup, aspirin, vitamins _ and
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that condoms are on the list of soon-to-be exempt items
was rekindling debate over birth control and whether the state
should promote it.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives lamented the fact that lawmakers who voted
last year to end the 6.25-percent sales tax on over-the-counter
medications used such broad criteria that _ inadvertently or not _
they exempted condoms from the levy.
</P>
<P>
   One group, the Texas Eagle Forum, claimed the exemption will
foster promiscuity. But proponents of family planning were hailing
the arrival of tax-free condoms, citing their role in preventing
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate who
has said that abstinence should be promoted to teen-agers, proposed
the tax break during his re-election campaign in 1998 and didn't
want it to cover condoms, said his spokeswoman, Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   State tax collectors said they will have no choice but to extend
the exemption to prophylactics beginning Saturday because the 1999
law applies to all 100,000 nonprescription products that carry a
``National Drug Code,'' or NDC, issued by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption was contained in the same tax-break legislation
that granted consumers a sales tax holiday on clothing last summer.
As originally proposed by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, Senate Bill
441 would have exempted only children's nonprescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, signed into law by Bush, was expanded to include adult
over-the-counter medicines during negotiations with the Texas
House. The change that extended the exemption to adult medicines
was proposed by Rep. Brian McCall, R-Plano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just said `over-the-counter medications,''' McCall said
Tuesday, denying there was any orchestrated move to promote
condoms. He said it was ``never contemplated, in any legislative
discussions that I was part of, that condoms would or would not be
part of the definition.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to other lawmakers said there were discussions about
whether to specify which drugs or products the exemption should
cover, but for simplicity the lawmakers decided to use the FDA
coding system. At the time, supporters said the codes would at
least preclude tax breaks for herbal and folk remedies that were
not sanctioned by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   As approved, the exemption will apply to a wide range of items,
including allergy treatments, cold remedies, dandruff products,
medicated dental products, eye-care products, sedatives, sunburn
remedies, antacids, laxatives and wound-care dressings. But as an
example of how precise the FDA codes are, the exemption applies to
antiperspirants but not regular deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1 effective date for the exemption was set later than
other tax breaks in the same legislation in order to delay its
negative fiscal impact.

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
At some point, nearly every college basketball team has to go
through a rebuilding process. For Leonard Hamilton and the
University of Miami, it went a little deeper. The program had to be
resuscitated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hurricanes dropped basketball in 1971 because of dwindling
attendance and mounting financial losses. There was no team until
1985, when the program was revived.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, the Hurricanes had played a grand total of one NCAA
Tournament game, losing to Western Kentucky in 1960. That pre-dated
even the brief golden era of Rick Barry, who led the 1962-65 Miami
teams to a 65-16 record. Because of probation resulting from
recruiting violations, Barry's teams were shut out of the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But 35 years after Barry, Hamilton and the Hurricanes are
putting Miami on the basketball map again. Long perceived as merely
a football school, Miami beat Arkansas and Ohio State last week to
advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history. The
Hurricanes will play Tulsa on Friday night at the South Regional in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, we are swimming in uncharted waters, and it feels
kind of good,'' said Hamilton. ``Each time we win a game, each time
we take a step forward, we are making history for our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton came to Miami from Oklahoma State in 1990, a curious
career choice that has worked out for the best. He left a solid
program in what was then the Big Eight for Miami, which was about
to enter the rugged Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Foster got the program off the deck from 1985-90,
compiling a respectable 78-71 record while the Hurricanes played as
an independent. When Hamilton arrived in 1990, he knew that going
to the Big East in 1991 meant things were going to get worse before
they got better.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four seasons, the Hurricanes were 34-80 overall. In
the first three seasons in the Big East, they went 1-17, 7-11 and
0-18. Moreover, no one seemed to notice. Playing off-campus at
Miami Arena, the Hurricanes averaged about 3,000 fans per game
during Hamilton's first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There were times, certainly, when Hamilton wondered why he had
come to a football-oriented university to play losing basketball in
front of scant crowds. To his credit, Hamilton not only stayed with
the program, he turned it into one of the more impressive success
stories in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to try not to reinvent the wheel,'' said Hamilton.
``I talked to a lot of other coaches who were successful to try to
figure out how they got their programs to that point. I feel we've
made a lot of progress each year, but I feel we still have a long
way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about the job at Miami is that each and every
day, you feel there's something you can do to make the program
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has improved steadily since the 0-18 Big East disaster in
1993-94. The Hurricanes went 13-3 and shared the regular-season
conference title this season. Over the last two years, they are
28-6 in the conference, the best in the Big East. Over the last
four years, the record is 48-22, second-best in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have gone further in the NCAA Tournament this
year (they were eliminated by Purdue in the second round last year)
despite the loss of All-America forward Tim James, a first-round
draft pick of the Miami Heat in 1999. The Sweet 16-bound Hurricanes
are led by three seniors _ center Mario Bland and guards Johnny
Hemsley and Vernon Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley is a cool 3-point shooter (9-of-19 in the first two
games of the NCAAs) and the team's leading scorer at 18.3 points
per game, while Jennings is a point guard who averages nearly seven
assists. At 6-6 and 265 pounds, Bland is a cement block in the
middle of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trio came to Miami in 1996, the Hurricanes are 80-40
and have been to the NCAA Tournament three straight seasons. They
have played a big part in building Miami's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came in as a freshman, it was known as a football
school, no question,'' said Bland, who is from Jackson, Miss. ``We
were out to change that. It took some time, but we're getting
there. I'm not saying how far we can go, but if we play good
defense and execute on offense, we can win a few more.''
</P>
<P>
   That would put the Hurricanes in the Final Four, which would
certainly validate the program and perhaps even draw some fans in
Miami. Despite playing solid basketball the last few seasons, the
Hurricanes averaged only 3,995 at home this year. At the first two
rounds of the NCAA Tournament last weekend, only about 500 Miami
fans made the trip to Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The home crowds could increase if a proposed on-campus arena is
built, but the Hurricanes understand it's an uphill battle getting
attention for basketball at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt all along we could be a good basketball team, but
we've been reminded all along the way we believe more in ourselves
than the general public,'' said Hamilton. ``So we're constantly
feeling like we have to overcome another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always appear to be the underdogs. There are just things
that keep you motivated all the time. We want to see how high we
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Hurricanes have raised the national awareness of
their program _ for better or worse. As Jennings said after
Sunday's win, it's doubtful many bracketologists predicted Miami
would beat Ohio State in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We messed up a lot of people's brackets,'' Jennings said. ``I
think only Miami fans had us penciled in this far. We made a lot of
people upset instead of getting ourselves upset.''

   Fed Raises Interest Rates in Effort to Slow Economy
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy,
raising interest rates by a quarter-point in an effort to prevent
an outbreak of inflation. It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate
increase since June. The move was no surprise to economists and
investors, who had heard repeated hints over the last month from
Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to
stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until
the economy slows.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market shrugged off the news and moved higher. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The
Nasdaq composite index rose 101.68 points, to 4,711.68. The

GORE SLAMS BUSH OVER STANCE ON `STATISTICAL SAMPLING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Claiming it hurts minorities, Democrat Al Gore
Tuesday slammed his Republican presidential rival George W. Bush
for joining other Republicans in endorsing only traditional methods
of counting people in the census.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other Democrats have argued that to get a better handle
on the number of traditionally undercounted populations in the
country, the Census Bureau should rely on a technique called
``statistical sampling'' that relies on educated estimates to count
those groups who are the most difficult to reach with regular
counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ridiculous to believe that the most accurate way to
count everybody is to send people out with a clipboard and
pencil,'' Gore said at a community center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush spokesman Scott McClellan charged that it is Democrats
who are playing politics by trying to use a different census method
to gain a political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has a history of using
government agencies to further Democratic political goals,'' said
McClellan. ``Governor Bush believes we should count everyone. Al
Gore's attacks ignore a Supreme Court ruling that we must conduct
an actual head count, not use statistical guesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled last year that federal law does not
allow use of any method other than a head count to apportion
congressional seats among the states. The high court did not rule,
however, on use of sampling in other matters, such as
redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical sampling aims to minimize undercounts by making a
detailed survey of people in sample regions, then using that data
to assume characteristics about people in other regions with
similar demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also charged that Bush had not heeded the advice of his own
advisers, citing a 1997 report by the Texas office of State-Federal
Relations, which concluded that ``all sides in the census debate
concede that traditional methods of calculation ... will never
provide a full and accurate portrait of the U.S. population.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states, ``at issue is how to correct what everyone
acknowledges is an undercount and specifically an undercount of
certain populations, most often urban populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that in the 1990 census about a half million Texans
were not counted, a majority of them Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ignoring the advice of his own office in Texas about
what is in the best interest of the people of Texas,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president suggested that Bush was capitulating to the
Republican National Committee which has said that a change in
census techniques that increases the number of traditionally
Democratic minorities would hinder their efforts to carve out more
GOP congressional and state legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say to Governor Bush if you really believe every
American counts it is time to stand up the political operatives in
your own party and support a census that counts every American,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan did not dispute that the Texas office of State-Federal
Relations questioned the accuracy of the current census methods in
its 1997 report. However, he said the report did not recommend a
specific alternative, such as statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that subsequent reports by the office slightly softened
the census language changing ``all sides in the census debate
concede'' to ``many in the census debate believe that the
traditional methods of calculation ... will never provide a full
and accurate portrait of the U.S population.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush appoints the director of the Office of State-Federal
Relations and sits on a three-member advisory board which oversees
its work. That board also includes Texas' lieutenant governor Rick
Perry, a Rep/Y[Z,X7,Cand \YX-Y9 K$h[YHR+W. HTW$SX7e1

PANEL ON TAXING INTERNET ENDS ITS MEETINGS IN DISAGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (mcd) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Amid bitter accusations that one company's desire for
tax breaks for itself had blocked a consensus, the commission
created to advise Congress on Internet sales taxes ended its last
scheduled meeting Tuesday in failure.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member commission did reach unanimous agreement on one
proposal, advanced by the chairman, Gov. James S. Gilmore 3rd of
Virginia: that what it characterized as surplus welfare funds
should be used to buy computers for the poor and to provide them
with access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But on the main issue before the commission, applying sales
taxes to the Internet, last-minute efforts to reach a compromise
collapsed. A coalition formed last week between the five antitax
members led by Gilmore, a Republican, and the six business
representatives held firm behind a proposal to defer taxing
Internet sales until at least 2006. But their 11 votes fell short
of the two-thirds margin, or 13 votes, required for a
recommendation of that plan.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenter, Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, also a Republican, said
that in private talks Monday night and Tuesday morning on how to
extend sales taxes to the Internet, the eight commissioners in his
camp and the six business representatives reached agreement on
every issue but one.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal called for simplifying the sales tax system _ for
example, making product definitions consistent from state to state,
and probably limiting each state to a single tax rate _ and
applying that system evenly to Internet, phone and mail-order
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The deal breaker was whether a company that sells over the
Internet could have technicians to service its products, and stores
to accept returned merchandise, yet remain exempt from sales taxes
on products it sells to Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, when a company has a bricks-and-mortar
presence or sales and technical agents in a state, it must collect
taxes on sales in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt assailed this proposed new exemption as ``a special
benefit, a permanent privilege'' that would allow such companies a
competitive advantage by selling products without adding sales
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we have a sales tax system that creates permanent special
privileges?'' he asked. ``Will we have a level playing field? You
know we all hate taxes, but if we have to pay them, then at least
they ought to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   He said making an exception for a company and others who
structure themselves in the same way would breed contempt for the
sales tax and encourage cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Leavitt nor Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas, a fellow panel
member who joined in the remarks, named any company. But Ted Waitt,
the chairman of Gateway, acknowledged in an interview that the
criticisms were aimed at his company, which makes personal
computers and related products and sells them over the Internet and
in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Waitt, one of the six business representatives on the panel,
disputed Leavitt's and Kirk's description of his company's
position, adding, ``We did not seek any special tax privilege for
ourselves.'' He said there were at least four unresolved issues
``that could have been resolved, but there just wasn't time.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's members, drawn from both government and public
industry, divided into three camps _ the five antitax members, led
by Gilmore; the six representatives of businesses, all with major
Internet interests; and eight others, mostly from government at
various levels and led by Leavitt, who say that the way an item is
sold should have no impact on how it is taxed.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Sales taxes are the largest single source
of revenue for state and local governments, approaching half their
money. And many officials fear that as sales migrate to the
Internet, that revenue will be lost, forcing higher income and
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   While this was the commission's last scheduled meeting, at the
urging of one member, C. Michael Armstrong, the chief executive of
AT&AMP;T, the commission changed its rules to allow an additional
meeting in the next 30 days by telephone conference call. Armstrong
said he wanted to leave the door open to a possible settlement,
saying that the only issue blocking settlement was one that did not
affect his company.
</P>
<P>
   That open door could also result in votes on two tax breaks that
Armstrong seeks for his company and which, if voted on separately,
would win the backing of 16 commissioners and perhaps all 19. They
would eliminate the 3 percent federal excise tax on telephone
service _ adopted as an emergency measure to finance the
Spanish-American War in 1898, when a relative handful of people had
telephones _ and reduce the overall taxes on telephone companies
since they are no longer regulated monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   And negotiations that could yet result in a consensus plan to
tax Internet sales continued Monday night as Waitt and Kirk met
here to continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the panel, formally known as the Advisory
Commission on Electronic Commerce, was sponsored by members of
Congress seeking to exempt the Internet _ as a vehicle of
interstate commerce _ from sales taxes. In October 1998, Congress
placed a three-year moratorium on any new, multiple or
discriminatory taxes on Internet dealings and then appointed the
commission, which was expected to recommend a no-sales-tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the representatives from business offered a plan that
assumed Internet sales would be taxed, and last week were near an
agreement with the Leavitt camp that would have resulted in 14
votes, more than the two-thirds needed, in favor of creating a
``level playing field'' for taxing sales by phone, mail order or
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the six executives broke with the Leavitt camp and aligned
themselves with Gilmore, who on Monday put together 11 votes for
the proposal to defer taxes until 2006. The eight members of the
Leavitt camp abstained from voting on most issues to protest
Gilmore's decision to send a report to Congress without the
two-thirds required for a formal recommendation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody in his right mind is actually enthusiastic when that
service cart starts inching down the aisle with the flight
attendants passing out the meals with their frightening
soup-kitchen cheeriness. But it was 8:30 a.m., and back in the last
row of steerage I was getting hungry in that first hour of the haul
from New York to Dallas. Not hungry enough for Special K, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``No eggs?'' I asked the flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head, smiled and explained that the eggs were all
gone by about halfway down the aisle. Cereal was all that was left.
``The Atkins diet,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about a third of the people I know are or have been in the
last six months on some variation of the spectacularly popular
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that are often referred to
generically as the Atkins diet, after one of the more popular
programs.
</P>
<P>
   You would think the airlines' food service might start
reflecting the fact that there has been a significant shift in the
American diet toward more protein and less carbohydrates. (Some
evidence: Last year, beef consumption rose 3 percent in the United
States, reversing a 20-year decline, and the beef industry said the
low-carb diets were partly responsible for the change). But
companies that supply in-flight meals say that they haven't been
asked to modify menus and, for instance, eliminate those puffy
muffins for a chunk of cheese _ perhaps because the diets are
considered to be fads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen it so far,'' said Bob Rosar, the corporate
executive chef at Dobbs International Services, a unit of Gate
Gourmet International, which supplies over 140 million meals a year
for more than 100 airlines. Rosar, who said that he had lost four
pounds during a brief period on a high-protein, low-carb diet, said
that if there was any shift in airline-food menus, it was toward
more vegetarian meals and away from meat _ largely the result of
pressure from European customers. Also, American business
travelers, especially those in the premium seats, are ``letting it
known that they expect a certain type of quality in the meals,'' he
said. ``Gone are the days of beef stew and mystery-meat entrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Michaela Kiesel, a senior vice president at LSG
Lufthansa Service Holding AG, another major supplier of airline
meals, said that frequent flyers are increasingly making it clear
that ``food quality is an important factor on which a decision in
choosing an airline is based,'' but that so far there has been no
clamor from the airlines for low-carb meals in particular.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because airlines aren't famous for listening to
their customers. Hotels, on the other hand, have their ears closer
to the ground in the area of customer service. One chain, Loews
Hotels, is introducing next month a new high-protein, low-carb menu
line called P(CENTS). The menu items, which will appear in
restaurants in all 15 Loews hotels, reflect surveys showing that
``25 percent of our customers are adhering to some form of a
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet,'' said Emily Kanders, a Loews
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines reflecting food tastes? ``Hah!'' said Clark Wolf, the
food and restaurant consultant for Loews and a man who travels
about 180 days of the year. ``Airlines could save a lot of money
and make a lot of friends by refraining from attempting to cook.
Just give me a hunk of cheese and an apple, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had the airlines out of his system, Wolf explained that
he was a proponent of the high-protein, low-carb diets, especially
to avoid gastric distress when traveling, because ``with these
foods, there's less going on in your tummy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new diets have been gaining in popularity for about two
years. ``But last fall, it became audible across the country,'' he
said. ``We were getting the same requests in all of our
restaurants'' for grilled chicken, beef and fish, with perhaps a
small green salad. ``And cheese,'' he added. ``Cheese courses are
back big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, 49, who is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 171 pounds, said
he decided to suggest to Loews officials that they introduce the
new menu line after he gathered 30 of the chain's executive chefs
and food directors at an annual conference in Miami Beach last
November. They went restaurant-hopping one night and ``we all
noticed that everybody was being very careful about carbs; I knew
that this was something we needed to be paying attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers are especially likely to be watching their
carbohydrate consumption, he said. ``It's almost like a club. You
see someone these days who's a major business traveler who isn't a
size 54, and you say, `Low carbs, high protein, huh?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf isn't an Atkins zealot by any means. There is considerable
evidence even beyond common nutritional sense that a prolonged diet
high in animal fats is not wise. But many travelers have learned
the virtues of the occasional spell of high-protein and
low-carbohydrate eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are eating this way you don't have to make a big
production out of being on a diet,'' Kanders said, explaining why
the P(CENTS) menu items are designed to appeal to business
travelers who might be hosting other business people while on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Besides weight watching, the current prosperity is also driving
some of the menu modifications, Wolf said. ``After the '87 crash,
potatoes got bigger on the plate while the protein shrank. Now,
people are asking for spotted blue prawns. They want veal scampi
from the north coast of Italy. They want Kobe beef. Good beef is
definitely in style.'' &QL;

   Nobody in his right mind is actually enthusiastic when that
service cart starts inching down the aisle with the flight
attendants passing out the meals with their frightening
soup-kitchen cheeriness. But it was 8:30 a.m., and back in the last
row of steerage I was getting hungry in that first hour of the haul
from New York to Dallas. Not hungry enough for Special K, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``No eggs?'' I asked the flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head, smiled and explained that the eggs were all
gone by about halfway down the aisle. Cereal was all that was left.
``The Atkins diet,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about a third of the people I know are or have been in the
last six months on some variation of the spectacularly popular
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets that are often referred to
generically as the Atkins diet, after one of the more popular
programs.
</P>
<P>
   You would think the airlines' food service might start
reflecting the fact that there has been a significant shift in the
American diet toward more protein and less carbohydrates. (Some
evidence: Last year, beef consumption rose 3 percent in the United
States, reversing a 20-year decline, and the beef industry said the
low-carb diets were partly responsible for the change). But
companies that supply in-flight meals say that they haven't been
asked to modify menus and, for instance, eliminate those puffy
muffins for a chunk of cheese _ perhaps because the diets are
considered to be fads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen it so far,'' said Bob Rosar, the corporate
executive chef at Dobbs International Services, a unit of Gate
Gourmet International, which supplies over 140 million meals a year
for more than 100 airlines. Rosar, who said that he had lost four
pounds during a brief period on a high-protein, low-carb diet, said
that if there was any shift in airline-food menus, it was toward
more vegetarian meals and away from meat _ largely the result of
pressure from European customers. Also, American business
travelers, especially those in the premium seats, are ``letting it
known that they expect a certain type of quality in the meals,'' he
said. ``Gone are the days of beef stew and mystery-meat entrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Michaela Kiesel, a senior vice president at LSG
Lufthansa Service Holding AG, another major supplier of airline
meals, said that frequent flyers are increasingly making it clear
that ``food quality is an important factor on which a decision in
choosing an airline is based,'' but that so far there has been no
clamor from the airlines for low-carb meals in particular.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because airlines aren't famous for listening to
their customers. Hotels, on the other hand, have their ears closer
to the ground in the area of customer service. One chain, Loews
Hotels, is introducing next month a new high-protein, low-carb menu
line called P(CENTS). The menu items, which will appear in
restaurants in all 15 Loews hotels, reflect surveys showing that
``25 percent of our customers are adhering to some form of a
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet,'' said Emily Kanders, a Loews
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines reflecting food tastes? ``Hah!'' said Clark Wolf, the
food and restaurant consultant for Loews and a man who travels
about 180 days of the year. ``Airlines could save a lot of money
and make a lot of friends by refraining from attempting to cook.
Just give me a hunk of cheese and an apple, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had the airlines out of his system, Wolf explained that
he was a proponent of the high-protein, low-carb diets, especially
to avoid gastric distress when traveling, because ``with these
foods, there's less going on in your tummy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new diets have been gaining in popularity for about two
years. ``But last fall, it became audible across the country,'' he
said. ``We were getting the same requests in all of our
restaurants'' for grilled chicken, beef and fish, with perhaps a
small green salad. ``And cheese,'' he added. ``Cheese courses are
back big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, 49, who is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 171 pounds, said
he decided to suggest to Loews officials that they introduce the
new menu line after he gathered 30 of the chain's executive chefs
and food directors at an annual conference in Miami Beach last

JAZZ SOLOS AS SONIC WALLPAPER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Barry Singer's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
Kurt Weill and cabaret in New York.  
 
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jazz is a music of unmistakable personalities. Though ensemble
interaction between these personalities remains one of the music's
glories, the expression of individual identity has always been the
essence of jazz, with players cultivating solo sounds as singular
as fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, classic recordings by these consummate
individualists are being deployed as a sort of mood music,
background noise for everything from Broadway drama to television
hucksterism to coffee bar drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some view this as a sign of jazz's mainstreaming, its wider
dissemination. Still, how distressing it is to hear music conceived
as the purest distillation of individuality rendered so
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling technology in the age of hip-hop has, of course,
already breached the foundations of the jazz solo, recycling many
notable ones into mere riffs behind raps. The ethics of this
electronic borrowing have been debated endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Some established players, like the hard-bop trumpeter Donald
Byrd, have in fact willingly collaborated with rappers. No doubt,
for those artists who have not, or their heirs, financial
compensation mitigates the implicit sense of theft. Yet it's hard
not to view such dispossession as, at the very least, an indignity.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing fondness evinced by advertising agencies for
classic jazz performances is an even more confounding blessing.
Song bites sung without attribution by Billie Holiday, Louis
Armstrong, Sarah Vaughan and Nina Simone have of late turned up as
sonic wallpaper in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   John Coltrane, once regarded as among the most inaccessible of
avant-gardists, has become a Madison Avenue favorite, with his
questing saxophone sound accessorizing national television
campaigns for Jeep Cherokee and Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane, who died in 1964, was an almost ascetically spiritual
musician. The posthumous use of his music as a commercial sales
tool really adds quite an ironic subtext to his life and work.
Arguments that any of these jazz performers are also being promoted
by these commercials collapse before one simple fact: none are ever
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the history of individual accomplishment in jazz so easy
to disregard, even in the face of seeming obeisance? Moreover, is
this unattributed use of jazz any worse than the anonymous
employment of classical music or country music or rock 'n' roll?
</P>
<P>
   It is. Classical music focuses more on a codified, structured
perfecting of individual expression than on the individuality
itself. Country music is consumed with making the simplest of
individualistic statements, and individuality for rock 'n' roll is
mostly a self-dramatic posture.
</P>
<P>
   Only jazz exists solely as a conduit for the expression of
individual personality, in its full range. To disassociate jazz
from its specific individual creators is to disrespect its essence.
This applies on stage, too, whether the classic jazz recordings are
being used in straight plays as a kind of mood-setting shorthand or
in an ``original'' musical like Lincoln Center Theater's
``Contact,'' whose score is made up almost entirely of such
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this dissassociation more egregious than in the
ostensibly respectful, jazz-infatuated drama ``Side Man,'' which
won the Tony Award last year for best play and recently opened in
London's West End.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' champions jazz's unsung laborers, those largely
anonymous musicians who backed up star soloists and filled out big
bands. The playwright Warren Leight, whose father Donald Leight was
a sideman, gives audiences a saga of family dysfunction set against
the post-World War II white jazz world of his father, with many of
the main characters former sidemen from, as Leight puts it, ``the
legendary, completely forgotten Claude Thornhill big band of the
1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the ebbing arc of these lives through a trumpeter idiot
savant of sorts named Gene Glimmer and his neglected son Clifford,
who narrates the piece, Leight invokes his protagonists' world with
a ``soundtrack'' of classic jazz recordings. ``I hear him before I
see him,'' Clifford says of his father at the outset. He adds:
``You could play me a hundred trumpet solos and I'd know which one
was his. My father's voice.''  &LR; Fair enough. The marvelous musicians
of the under-rated Thornhill band did in fact record a rich lode of
music. The saxophonists Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan and the
trumpeter Red Rodney were among the band's more distinguished
alumni. Certainly Rodney could have easily been represented here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet, whenever Leight's fictitious trumpeter Gene is said to be
soloing, recordings of either Lee Morgan, Miles Davis or, most
often, Clifford Brown are heard, except for one instance when the
audience is presented with a big band identified as Woody Herman's.
Then the trumpet heard is Roy Eldridge's, recorded with the Gene
Krupa orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Dizzy Gillespie, Morgan, Davis and Brown were the
titans of postwar jazz horn playing, with Eldridge their symbolic
prewar father. Each man was a player of commanding individuality,
even genius. Their instrumental voices remain among the most
indelible in jazz history.
</P>
<P>
   To employ any of them as offstage stand-ins for onstage sidemen
is misleading. To suggest, even with dramatic license, that their
playing might be anyone other than themselves is absurd, tantamount
to offering up a Sinatra recording as a theatrical character's
singing voice or a passage from Hemingway's ``Old Man and the Sea''
as the work of a fictional author.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all of these musicians were black. In the context of
the jazz life that Leight purports to portray, blacks and whites
created their music under significantly different conditions.
Blacks were generally the innovators and whites the followers in
jazz. Additionally, from a business standpoint, black musicians, in
the period Leight writes about, were still often discriminated
against.
</P>
<P>
   Leight does, in passing, acknowledge the point about black
innovation, however disingenuously. ``Just do not mention me and
Dizzy in the same sentence,'' Gene Glimmer insists to his future
wife, after she has done just that. ``I am not worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the play's finest moment, Gene and two of his sidemen
pals are literally transfixed by a bootleg tape of Clifford Brown
recorded in a Philadelphia jam session on what may have been the
last night of his life. (The hugely influential Brown died in an
automobile accident on June 26, 1956, at the age of 25.) Leight's
depiction of his characters' veneration of this recording is pitch
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man,'' nevertheless, cavalierly blurs jazz identity in a
dangerous way. And yet, to complain about Leight's misappropriation
of jazz history somehow seems churlish. For the presence of jazz in
``Side Man'' and on television commercials and even in hip-hop is
better than no presence at all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one understands this more poignantly than Larue Brown
Watson, Clifford Brown's widow. ``The first 15 minutes I was about
to have a heart attack,'' Brown Watson said recently, recalling the
first time she saw ``Side Man.'' ``I thought, what is this? But
then something clicked for me. Because you know what? All these
young kids came to `Side Man' not knowing anything about jazz. But
they left saying they had to get some of this music. And I said, ah
hah. I get it. Because, to me, if you can just get one person to
listen to jazz, well, it's all worth it then, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably. And yet, as this quintessential music of the
20th century filters into the 21st at an increasingly distant
remove, it is more important than ever that we keep the names of
the players and their achievements straight. Because the men and
women of jazz's first century gave their lives over to making their
sounds and souls indivisible. To lose those connections would be a
crime.

GORE SWEEPS THROUGH NEW JERSEY PICKING UP ENDORSEMENTS AND
DOLLARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. _ Vice President Al Gore swept into Bill
Bradley's home state Tuesday and received the endorsements of top
allies of his vanquished foe, welcoming them into his continuing
march toward unifying the Democratic party for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   At Baumgart's Restaurant here in this New York City suburb, Gore
embraced the Bradley allies, including Doug Berman, Bradley's
campaign chairman, Richard Codey, minority leader of the state
senate and Bradley's New Jersey chairman, Brendan Byrne, the former
governor, and assorted others, saying he wanted to ``make all of
them feel completely and totally welcome in an effort that is going
to carry the banner that both of us believe in forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman, addressing the nearly 40 officials who were standing
with Gore in the dining room here, said: ``Intra-family fights can
seem pretty intense at times.'' But he added: ``I am strong in my
support for the vice president,'' who, he said, ``will fight for
the important things,'' including abortion rights and education.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is on vacation and was not here Tuesday, dropped
out of the Democratic presidential race on March 9 after winning no
primaries. During the campaign he said Gore represented
``entrenched power'' and had run a negative campaign that had
distorted his record. But in announcing his withdrawal he said he
would support Gore, although he did not release his delegates.
Aides to both men expect that at some point, the two will hold a
joint appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Tuesday's get-together ``a great gathering of unity
and common purpose'' and went out of his way to say that he had
learned a lot from Bradley _ comments that stood in contrast to
those of Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee,
who said last week that his rival, Sen. John McCain, had not
brought anything new to light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from the dialogue and the debates that we
had,'' Gore said. Gore, who also used to call Bradley a quitter for
retiring from the Senate in 1996 and ridiculed him as an academic
rather than a realist, credited him Tuesday with bringing racial
issues, health care and campaign finance to the top of the
election-year agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lifted high the banner of campaign finance reform, and I
admire his persistence and stamina in pushing that issue to the
forefront,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore crammed the endorsement session in between fund-raising
events here and in Manhattan, holding three events that brought him
at least $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is in a frantic swirl to reach the $33.8 million limit that
he can raise before the August convention, and he is nearly there.
As soon as he reaches that amount for his own campaign, he will
concentrate on helping the Democratic National Committee raise its
goal of $100 million for the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tuesday's events, the vice president plans to
pick up money later this week in Cincinnati, Detroit and Houston.
He has two lunches scheduled for Wednesday in Washington, D.C., for
the Democratic National Committee, where he expects to raise
$700,000 as he shuttles between two rooms in the same hotel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But his activities are somewhat incongruous, coming as he has
begun to portray himself as an apostle of reform, chastened by his
zealous fundraising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   His first event Tuesday was a luncheon at the Upper East Side
home of John and Janet Wallach. He is a former investment banker
and the couple founded Seeds for Peace, a program that seeks to
bring Israeli and Palestinian children together. About 30 people
(``solicitors'' in campaign finance jargon) brought $5,000 each and
dined on sesame-seared salmon and pistachio mousse with the vice
president at small tables set up in the Wallach's living room.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about what his priorities would be if
he were president, Gore discussed education, cleaning up the
environment, improving health care and changing the campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign finance reform is a priority because I believe our
system is greatly in need of the changes that can put the people
back in the driver's seat in our democracy,'' he told his
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   He then drove in his motorcade to the restaurant here, and then
attended two more fundraisers. He raised about $100,000 at the home
of James and Joyce Demetrakis, who work in real estate, and about
$200,000 at the home of Mark Frankel, a venture capitalist.

 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stone guests make grim company. Ask Don Giovanni. Or
Zampa, the pirate king in Ferdinand Herold's opera by that name. As
Mount Etna erupts in the background (the scene is in Sicily), the
scoundrel ends up crushed in the embrace of the statue of Alice
Manfredi, a 16-year-old Florentine he seduced and abandoned a
decade before the curtain rises.
</P>
<P>
   His fate had begun to look dire in the finale of the second of
three acts, when the statue refused to surrender a wedding ring he
had impiously slipped on its finger. In the meantime he prudently
had the stone maiden tossed in the sea. To no avail, and her
show-stopping revenge well justifies the opera's alternative title,
``La Fiancee de Marbre,'' or ``The Marble Bride,'' even though _
unlike her booming fatherly counterpart in Mozart _ Alice utters
not a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zampa,'' introduced to wild acclaim at the Opera-Comique in
Paris in 1831, remained a fixture in France, Italy and Germany
through the 19th century. Today the overture is the sole excerpt
that enjoys any name recognition, and that only barely. A whirlwind
potpourri of infectious tunes from the opera, it displays
orchestration of a zest and finesse that bring to mind Weber,
Mendelssohn and Berlioz.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, at Alice Tully Hall, a concert revival by L'Opera
Francais de New York _ with narration written and delivered by the
composer's descendant Alexander Herold replacing the original
spoken dialogue _ restores the subsequent action in what is said to
be the opera's first New York hearing in more than a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Welborn sings the title role of the rake and swaggerer, a
tenor whose lines spike up to high D flat but hover on occasion
around low G, dangerous and difficult territory. Isabel
Bayrakdarian, the rising lyric soprano, appears as Camille, whose
virtue catches his heart off guard. Yves Abel, the company's
co-founder and artistic director, conducts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Textbooks say that the true Romantics were the Germans,'' Abel
said recently from Chicago, where he was conducting Donizetti's
``Elisir d'Amore.'' ``As I began to dig, I saw _ not true! The true
Romantics were the people living and working in Paris during the
Terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time when all the old rules were being broken.
Composers were free to use strange harmonies, to divorce themselves
from traditional librettos about gods and nymphs frolicking in
magic forests. `Zampa' is later, but it comes out of that world.
Musically, it combines the heroic French grand opera style of the
Opera with the lighter musical-theater style of the Opera-Comique.
And there's the bel canto influence of the Theatre des Italiens,
where they performed Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini. Dramatically,
like many other pieces of the time, it's amazingly Goyaesque: full
of blood, murder, love, raw emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting nationality aside, the description suggests Verdi in the
early phase from, say, ``Ernani'' to ``I Masnadieri'' or ``Luisa
Miller.'' But to ears accustomed to Italianate passion, the
pre-eminent characteristic of the score of ``Zampa'' is its
lightness, its balanced, even balletic, grace. By the standards of
``Don Giovanni'' or of Weber's milestone of Romanticism ``Der
Freischutz,'' which preceded ``Zampa'' by a decade, Herold's
incursions of the demonic are mild.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial Romantic spirit Abel speaks of shows in restless
shifts between major and minor, in meter and in tempo, but the
strophic or otherwise repetitive numbers the composer favors tend
to spin in place rather than propel the plot. Still, the freshness
and variety of the melodies are a constant delight. Listeners could
catch themselves tapping their toes and (God forbid) even humming
along. Realism was the last thing on the composer's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, the sets and costumes told you everything you
needed to know,'' the very lively family spokesman said early this
month from his home in the Spanish town of Valencia, with Rossini's
``Pietra del Paragone'' blaring in the background. ``Opera was a
lot of people gussied up singing to the audience. Nowadays people
expect dramatic coherency and naturalism. In `Zampa,' that's not
part of the equation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the company is advertising a ``concert performance,'' the
playbill lists Herold not only as narrator but also as director. In
that capacity, he had a tentative notion _ as yet untested _ of
putting the singers in 1830s concert dress rather than in
theatrical costumes suitable to their characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evening dress is certainly preferable to capes and bandanas,''
Herold reasoned. ``The challenge of the performance is to make the
opera true to itself and intelligible for us. It's the same as when
we perform Shakespeare today. It makes no sense to do Shakespeare
on the moon or on roller skates. What the plays are about is what
Shakespeare wrote. What Herold wrote is what we've got to do, on
its own terms. We should have a certain suggestion of the early
19th century. It will be easier to believe in the piece if what
we're watching is antique people doing something antique.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No sidestepping the story, in other words. It involves (in
addition to the characters already mentioned) the upright Alphonse,
to whom Camille is initially engaged, and the offstage figure of
Camille's rich merchant father, captured by Zampa and marked for
death unless she gives Zampa her hand in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the marble bride at last intervenes, Zampa is
revealed to be the long-lost brother of Alphonse, his rival: shades
of ``Il Trovatore,'' years in the future. (The chorus of cheerful,
clueless townsfolk and frolicsome pirates anticipates Gilbert and
Sullivan.) In a buffo subplot, Camille's presumptively widowed
confidante discovers in one of Zampa's lieutenants her long-lost
husband, giving rise to a deliciously ambivalent recognition scene.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from melodiously anguished duets, Camille's role includes
a ballad recounting the tale of Alice Manfredi. In its simpler way,
the set piece functions much as the heroine's ghost story early in
Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' another Romantic touchstone.
Does Bayrakdarian sense a parallel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Camille sings in French,'' she replied from her home in
Toronto. ``Can we make a comparison when the pieces are in
different languages? Italian has a completely different flavor. In
`Zampa,' the ballad is like a folk song. Singing it, I wouldn't
concern myself to make every note as developed and pearl-like as
Donizetti would require. I don't think it's meant to be dug into
for deeper meanings. As I look at the score, what I see is a very
French economy of means. There's not a lot of extra or complicated
harmony, but when it comes, it really makes a point. All the singer
has to do is respond to that, and it becomes beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampa's hold on the imagination of his contemporaries
notwithstanding, his character may today be harder to put across.
The drama calls for a latter-day Don Giovanni, brute and seducer.
Don Giovanni, of course, is a bass or baritone, possessed of all
the demonic macho potential inherent in the lower vocal register.
</P>
<P>
   As a romantic tenor, Zampa automatically appears in a more
tractable, more civilized light. The refrain of his aria _ as
buoyant as it is boyish _ conjures up a scamp rather than a
scoundrel, the nimble lothario of some forgotten operetta.
</P>
<P>
   Among tenor parts, Zampa perhaps anticipates the Duke of Mantua,
in ``Rigoletto,'' who, disarmed by Gilda's innocence, feels the
stirrings of a love of which his past frivolity and selfishness
have left him incapable. But such a view leaves a great deal
unaccounted for. What is Zampa's blackmail of another man's bride
but a villain's gratuitous show of power? Abel and Welborn see
ambiguity not only in the libretto but also in the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such bravura in what Zampa sings,'' said Welborn,
tracked down in Virginia while minding two rambunctious young sons.
``He takes himself and his attractions seriously, but he also
laughs at himself, which is part of his appeal. He's definitely
attracted to Camille. She's very modest and discreet. I don't think
he's ever met anyone like her before. He relishes his power, but he
falls in love. Power and love _ I'd like to strive to show both.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than a decade after carting the four-story-high
Golden Boy and its global pedestal from Manhattan to Basking Ridge,
N.J., AT&AMP;T officials have acknowledged what might have seemed
obvious to some:
</P>
<P>
   Gleefully brandishing thunderbolts, with muscles more clearly
defined than Sylvester Stallone's in his Rocky days, Golden Boy _ a
k a, the Genius of Electricity and, later, the Spirit of
Communications _ is an Art Deco classic and an icon of New York,
where it had stood since it was created in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   The statue currently stands on a closely cropped lawn in front
of one of the company's cookie-cutter corporate buildings, his
gilded posterior level with a row of windows.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Golden Boy a home in New York is proving to be a
formidable task. But, on a smaller scale, the city has grappled
with this problem before. In the mid-1980s, the board of TriBeCa's
small, pristine Washington Market Park refused to accept a statue
of Mohandas K. Gandhi; and some residents around Union Square Park,
where it currently stands, objected, too. Also in the 1980's, the
placement in the Bronx of a statue of a young man with a pit bull
stirred up such anger that it was eventually moved to Socrates
Sculpture Park in Queens. And it has taken six years for the New
York Road Runners Club and the city to agree on a site for a statue
of Fred Lebow, founder of the New York City marathon.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is willing to donate Golden Boy and the cost of its upkeep
to the Parks Department, said Gary A. Morgenstern, an AT&AMP;T
spokesman. And Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, said in an
interview Tuesday: ``I want it a lot. It's classic _ of sculpture
or kitsch, whatever you think. It's a very significant American
piece. It's a treasure and it would be fun to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But where in downtown Manhattan, the center of commerce, is
there a park that is large enough for a statue that is 24 feet
tall, not counting the 21-foot-tall pedestal, with a 12-foot
wingspan and legs that stretch for 7 feet, a statue whose
fingernails are 2 inches long?
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this problem might seem far from
insurmountable. And at second glance, it might seem that New York
City should accept the gift immediately. But finding a home for
even more ordinary statues, smaller and less dramatic, is often
delicate and difficult. And the size, age and flamboyance of Golden
Boy makes it especially tough.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are other statues around the city that need
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, four 100-year-old bronze eagles surrounding the
main obelisk of the Prison Ship Martyrs monument in Fort Green,
Brooklyn, were removed after being severely damaged by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the eagles now stand sentinel outside the doors of
Stern's office at the Arsenel, the Parks headquarters, on the east
side of Central Park. Two are stored in a room nearby. Some Fort
Green residents want them back, said Bob Evans, president of
Community Board 2. Others, afraid of further vandalism, say they
should stay at the Arsenal, where they are out of sight, but safe.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said there are plans to return the eagles to the monument,
which is being renovated, when and if the city can find a way to
keep them safe.
</P>
<P>
   And the city and the New York Road Runners Club recently agreed
to move the life-size statue of the group's founder, Lebow, to the
east side of Central Park, in the 90s, near the club headquarters.
For some four years, the statue of Lebow, who died in 1994, has
been nestled in the bushes near Tavern on the Green, on the west
side of the park, near the finish line of the New York Marathon.
Some club members preferred that the Lebow statue stay there, while
others wanted it closer to the clubhouse. But even though the
factions have come to an agreement, the Lebow statue will not be
moved to its new home until a renovation of the park along the east
90's is completed.
</P>
<P>
   A newly proposed statue of Sojourner Truth, the former slave and
freedom fighter, faced another problem: many neighborhoods wanted
it.
</P>
<P>
   The statue will show Sojourner Truth holding a Bible at the
start of a preaching tour covering hundreds of miles. It is to
stand in Columbia Park in Brooklyn, on Tillary and Court Streets,
which she passed through when she began preaching. It will be
bronze and cost about $1.5 million, said Julius O. Pearse, an
omsbudsman with the National Negro Business and Professional
Women's Club Inc., which is building the statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of emotion around it,'' Pearse said. When word
got around, several local community organizations wanted it in
their neighborhoods, he said. But the Cadman Plaza-Columbia Park
area was historically correct, as well as near the courthouse and
therefore a well-traveled spot for ``a patron saint of
abolitionists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a home for Golden Boy is proving as difficult as
finding an $800 one-bedroom in Chelsea. The directors of the first
site approached by the city, Washington Market Park in TriBeCa, on
Chambers and Greenwich Streets, rejected the offer out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' said Kathryn Freed, a city councilwoman who was
instrumental in creating the two-acre park from a vacant lot in the
1970's. ``This is a little park. It would have totally dominated
the whole thing. This is a little green park that is intensely used
by whole community. People come out and sit. Kids run around. The
idea of plunking down a big statue _ I don't care how gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parks,'' she continued, ``should be green things, not gold
things. Clearly, whoever thought of us is someone who doesn't like
parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he has a few sites in mind, all downtown, where AT&AMP;T
was headquartered for so long. He will not reveal them. ``I don't
want to get mired in contention,'' he said. ``People kvetch about
statues.''

WHO IS THAT MAN POSING AS RICHARD FOREMAN?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Richard Foreman found his alter ego at last? Could it be
that the poor mad philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is the perfect
analogue for the playwright and director, who for more than 30
years has been breaking the boundaries of theater to combine the
surreal, the disordered, the mysterious and, sometimes, the just
plain nutty?
</P>
<P>
   This year is the centenary of Nietzsche's death, and he is the
subject of Foreman's new play, ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!,'' which runs
through April 30 at his Ontological-Hysteric Theater at St. Mark's
Church in Manhattan. ``Nietzsche was a sweet, retiring nebbish like
me,'' Foreman, 62, said recently. ``I identified with him
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his SoHo loft and looking a bit like a balding basset
hound, Foreman was surrounded by strange objects. There was a toy
lamb and a parrot; a horsehead from his production of ``The
Threepenny Opera''; an assemblage of a snake and the Pope on a bed
of nails staring at each other, by Foreman's wife, Kate Manheim, an
artist. There was Manheim's new work, images taken from a
19th-century gynecological textbook on venereal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1987, after she was struck by a mysterious illness that
caused her severe pain, Manheim was Foreman's leading stage
interpreter, and scattered through the loft are cardboard and
balsa-wood valentines he has made for her, one a train with the
words ``Richard Loves Kate'' on it and the figure of Foreman
leaning out the window.
</P>
<P>
   But dominating the space and lining every wall are Foreman's
10,000 books. He is widely read in European intellectual history:
Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Lacan. And, of course,
Nietzsche. But ``it was the image of Nietzsche holding his head and
having an idea, as an icon of a hermitlike intellectual, that
dominated me as much as his specific ideas,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' is in many ways typical Foreman: ropes
strung across the stage, optometrists' letters, a clear plexiglass
wall separating the audience from the performers. The actors wear
headsets with microphones and funny hats. But this is the first
time that Foreman has based a play on a historical figure.
</P>
<P>
   Nietzsche, born in 1844 in Rocken, near Leipzig, is widely
regarded as one of the foremost influences on contemporary
philosophy, and as a precursor of existentialism and
post-structuralism. In ``The Birth of Tragedy,'' published in 1872,
he questioned the foundations of Western rationalism as exemplified
by Socrates and the plays of Euripides, espousing a new kind of
morality, one based on the mastery of the passions, not their
extirpation through religion.
</P>
<P>
   In his best-known work, ``Thus Spake Zarathustra,'' published in
1883-85, Nietzsche wrote of the death of God and the will to power,
and developed his notion of the Superman, a figure who celebrates
life on earth, rather than as it is sanctified in the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   For the young Nietzsche, his friend Richard Wagner was the
perfect exemplar of passion and will combined in the artist, the
authentic heir to the Greek tragedians. But Nietzsche broke with
Wagner over the composer's anti-Semitism, his manipulativeness and
the cult he had inspired at Bayreuth.
</P>
<P>
   Grand as Nietzsche's ideas were, the philosopher led a lonely
life. His father, a Lutheran pastor, died when his son was 4, and
Nietzsche's childhood was dominated by women. He was said to have
contracted syphilis in a brothel as a student, and suffered from
migraines and stomach pains.
</P>
<P>
   His one great love was the writer and psychoanalyst Lou
Andreas-Salome, but their relationship was chaste, and she did not
return his affection. She later became the mistress of the poet
Rainer Maria Rilke.
</P>
<P>
   In 1889 Nietzsche suffered a breakdown. At first he raved,
singing wildly, banging on his piano, tearing off his clothes in
the street. He wrote letters to friends and the courts of Europe
announcing that he was Dionysus and ``the Crucified.'' Gradually,
he withdrew, until, near the end, he was barely aware of the world.
``Nietzsche lies upstairs all day dressed in a flannel gown,'' his
friend Peter Gast wrote in 1894. ``He does not look bad, has grown
very quiet and gazes ahead with a dreamy and very questioning
expression. ... He hardly recognizes me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After Nietzsche's death, his ideas were distorted and
discredited through his sister Elisabeth, a Hitler supporter, and
they became identified with Nazism. But in the late 1960s and early
'70s, a new generation of interpreters found in Nietzsche an icon
who questioned established morality. And in recent years, he has
undergone another resurgence, becoming a hero to post-modernist
thinkers and artists, including Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Foreman's productions, ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' defies
easy description. At the center is a Nietzsche-like figure, played
by Gary Wilmes with a big mustache, a white gown and nightcap. It
was an image, Foreman said, inspired by accounts of the mad
philosopher being coaxed onto a train to go to a clinic and being
told he was going to meet a prince. Like many Foreman characters,
this one is a timid soul picked upon by the world, especially, in
this case, by a character called the Cruel Man, a drawling Kevin
Hurley wearing a schoolgirl's pleated skirt on suspenders over his
shirt and pants. ``He's the kind of person against me and Nietzsche
and all people like us,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of Nietzsche's anguished world is a character
known as the Child, a rather sexual creature played by an adult,
Sarah Louise Lilley. ``I have read bits and pieces of things you
write, Nietzsche,'' she says in a Marilyn Monroe-like voice, ``so I
imagined you big and strong, with eyes on fire. Is it possible _
maybe you aren't the real Nietzsche?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And, typical of Foreman, there is a dominatrix-like figure, this
one with rouged nipples, called the Beautiful Woman, played by
Juliana Francis and inspired somewhat, Foreman said, by
Andreas-Salome.
</P>
<P>
   Threaded through the work are excerpts from Nietzsche's letters
and doggerel. ``After you discover me, you find me. The difficulty
now is to lose me,'' says Wilmes as Nietzsche, in words from one of
the philosopher's letters after his breakdown. ``I write on paper,
write on wall,'' the character says at another point, ``with
foolish heart a foolish scrawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman said he made a conscious decision not to use Nietzsche's
philosophical writings. ``His reality came through. It was like
doodling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything more boring than to see a Tom
Stoppard type of play,'' Foreman said, referring to Stoppard's
historically based dramas.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Foreman prefers to free associate with history
rather than to anchor his dramas in a real time and place. (In his
review of ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' in The New York Times, Ben
Brantley praised Foreman for not making obvious decisions, such as
refraining from using the music of Wagner and Strauss, two
composers associated with the title character.)
</P>
<P>
   The play contains images that refer directly to the
philosopher's life. At one point, the character Nietzsche throws
his arms around a stuffed horse, a reference to an incident in 1889
when the real Nietzsche saw a horse being beaten and tried to help
it, which precipitated his final breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make a test,'' the Child says to the stage Nietzsche,
her voice insinuating. ``Suppose I climb up to that little horse
dangling from the ceiling and start beating it and beating it and
beating it _ would you protect that poor little horse?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess,'' replies Nietzsche, sounding as if he is saying
``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In another image from life, the Beautiful Woman whips Nietzsche
as he pulls a cart. In 1882, Andreas-Salome persuaded Nietzsche and
his friend Paul Ree to live in a menage a trois without sex, an
arrangement that quickly broke apart. A photograph from the time
shows the two men pulling a cart containing Andreas-Salome, who is
whipping them as if they were horses. Ree smiles at the joke.
Nietzsche looks beyond, dogged and hurt. ``Whip me, sir, and you
whip my horse,'' the character of Nietzsche says in the play.
``Remember _ I'll pay you very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But like all his plays, ``Bad Boy Nietzsche!'' is primarily
Foreman's fantasy. ``Have some slices of this holy bread which
trembles in expectation,'' the character of Nietzsche says. ``There
are jewels, valuable jewels in this bread.'' The characters soon
confuse the words ``jewels'' and ``Jews,'' a reference, Foreman
said, to Nietzsche's Christian background, the communion wafer and
the incorrect charges of anti-Semitism against him.
</P>
<P>
   In one sequence, a cardboard boat sails across the stage and the
character of Nietzsche suddenly finds himself in China. This is an
allusion to the fact that ``his ideas turned the world upside
down,'' Foreman said. He added that the image also came from his
own childhood, when he would pass a toy boat resting on ice in a
fish store window on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   The play ends on a decidedly different note from Foreman's
previous work. Most often, his heroes begin as slightly grandiose
figures and in the end are defeated. Toward the end of ``Bad Boy
Nietzsche!'' the philosopher sequesters himself in a tanklike
structure onstage. ``I'm never coming out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The other characters begin beating the horse. In fact, says the
Child, they can beat the horse as much as they like, ``Right, Mr.
Nietzsche? Right? Right?''
</P>
<P>
   But as they do, Nietzsche emerges from the tank. ``You lied to
us, Mr. Nietzsche,'' the Child cries. ``You said you were never
coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of Nietzsche replies: ``Yes, but how is that
possible? Because I never lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman offered an explanation for the line: ``Nietzsche locked
himself inside his madness, but he did come back. His philosophy is
now dominant in the Western world.''

FORMER GM EXECUTIVE FORMS WEB SITE FOR MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS
SUPPLIERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A former General Motors executive announced Tuesday
that he had formed an Internet company that would aim to make it
easier for the largest American companies to buy parts and supplies
from minority-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure that minority businesses are not left behind
in the migration to online marketplaces,'' said Roy S. Roberts, the
chairman, chief executive and half-owner of M-Xchange.com, a
business-to-business Internet company, and a former group vice
president of GM.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site will seek to provide one-stop shopping for
companies in any industry looking to buy products and services from
companies owned by racial minorities or women. ``We want to take
all businesses and expose them to minority businesses,'' Roberts
said. ``You can't get that today.''
</P>
<P>
   The start-up company has the backing of the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
who was on hand Tuesday to promote M-Xchange.com with a message to
largely white corporate America: ``There is nothing you want to
procure that we cannot supply.'' For several years, Jackson has
campaigned through his Wall Street Project to bring mainstream
investments to minority companies and communities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives as well as minority-owned companies were
enthusiastic about the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers in Detroit will probably be big customers, said Bud
Liebler, vice president for marketing at DaimlerChrysler. ``It
would be something that all three of the companies and a lot of
companies beyond the automotive industry may have a need for,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Minority-owned companies are eager to sign up. ``There is no
question that business-to-business connectivity is going to be a
highway to the future and all companies need to understand how to
use that new channel, and minority companies in particular,'' said
Melvin Brown, owner of ChemPak Inc., a company based in Westland,
Mich., that sells industrial cleaning products primarily to the
auto and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   M-Xchange.com is expected to begin service in mid-July, said
Roberts, 60, who was General Motors' highest-ranking black
executive before he retired in February. His white co-founder, Gary
Wasserman, 50, owns 49 percent of M-Xchange.com, and is its
president.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the business remain to be determined. Its
headquarters will be in Detroit, Roberts said. As it seeks to grow
quickly, it will probably consider selling shares to the public.
Suppliers listing themselves on the Internet exchange will probably
pay M-Xchange.com an undetermined fee. Companies that use the Web
site to hire suppliers will probably account for most of the Web
site's revenue and are likely to pay a percentage of the contract
they award to the Internet matchmaking service.
</P>
<P>
   M-Xchange.com estimated that by 2003, mainstream companies will
buy about $135 billion, or 5 percent of total business-to-business
e-commerce purchases, from minority-owned suppliers.

   NEW YORK _ The international art gallery that was at the center
of one of the art world's most spectacular scandals _ the
plundering of the estate of Mark Rothko _ was accused in court
papers in London on Tuesday of cheating a second prominent artist,
the British figurative painter Francis Bacon, and systematically
defrauding him and his heir.
</P>
<P>
   In papers submitted to the High Court, lawyers for the estate of
Bacon, who died in 1992, charged that the gallery, Marlborough
International Fine Art, consistently undervalued many of Bacon's
paintings, which it bought outright from him and quickly resold for
substantially higher prices, and could not account for the
whereabouts of many other paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers estimated the losses at tens of millions of dollars
but said a total could not be established because Marlborough
quickly moved documents out of Britain and seized photographs of
the disputed paintings when it became clear that a court case was
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Georgianna Gibbs, a spokeswoman for Marlborough London gallery,
said that Bacon was aware of the gallery's activities and
transactions on his behalf. She also said the gallery has provided
access to all the records that lawyers for Bacon's estate have
requested. ``But any other documentation relevant to the claim will
be disclosed during the course of the court action,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the documents that were moved out of Britain were
papers that were returned to the Liechtenstein branch. Robert
Hunter, a lawyer for Marlborough International, said he could not
comment directly on the allegations because of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the gallery took control of the most
minute aspects of Bacon's financial and personal life _ to the
point of paying his laundry bills and handing him spending money _
and then used this grip to deprive him of the true value of his
work. According to the lawsuit, the Marlborough connection
continued after Bacon's death, when a director of Marlborough's
London gallery was named an executor of his estate and ran it to
the detriment of his sole heir, John Edwards, an illiterate and
reclusive cockney who now lives in Thailand and with whom, friends
say, Bacon had a filial relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's paintings of distorted, anguished figures fetched as
much as $6 million at auction and made him one of Britain's most
celebrated postwar artists. His own life was as openly tortured as
his art. ``You can't be more horrific than life itself,'' the
artist was fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   He cultivated a bad boy reputation, speaking freely about his
abuse of alcohol, his homosexuality, his penchant for gambling and
his kinship with gangsters. Born in Ireland, he lived most of his
life in a rundown mews house in South Kensington, London, with bare
light bulbs, a tub in the kitchen, and paintings and photographs
strewn everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some artists who change galleries throughout their
careers, Bacon put all his faith in the Marlborough Gallery, which
represented him from 1958 until his death of a heart attack eight
years ago at 82. For much of that time Marlborough reigned over the
contemporary art scene as one of the leading international
galleries with branches in New York, London, Geneva, Madrid and
Vaduz, Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rothko scandal shook it from its pedestal. In 1983,
Frank Lloyd, Marlborough's founder, was convicted of evidence
tampering and sentenced to perform community service in connection
with the 11-year case in which Marlborough and the executors of the
Rothko estate were found to have engaged in a conflict of interest
in selling and consigning Rothko's work. Lloyd, who died two years
ago, the gallery and two executors were fined $9.2 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the charges made by the lawyers for Bacon's estate
involved activities that they said took place during the same time
period as many of the Rothko transactions. Lloyd, as well as his
son, Gilbert, a director of Marlborough were named in the suit
filed Tuesday. Two other directors of Marlborough were also cited,
the Duke of Beaufort and Gilbert de Botton.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's will, which he wrote a year before his death, was drawn
up by Theodore Goddard, a London law firm that represented
Marlborough. In it he left his estate to Edwards. Bacon appointed
three executors: Valerie F. Beston, a director of Marlborough Fine
Art, London; Paul Brass, his doctor; and de Botton, chairman of
Global Asset Management. De Botton declined to take up his role as
an executor.
</P>
<P>
   The papers contend that Marlborough bought paintings outright
from Bacon for well below fair market value and sold them for
several times as much within months. A 1958 agreement filed with
the court shows that Marlborough estimated the value of Bacon's
paintings based on size _ $462 for a painting 24 x 20 inches and
$1,176 for one 78 x 65 inches. John Eastman, the lawyer for the
estate, said an artist of Bacon's stature would get far more _
about 70 percent of the price the gallery anticipated getting from
a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents, the gallery valued one painting,
``Statue and Figures in the Street,'' from 1983, at $250,000 in
January 1984. Four months later it paid Bacon $66,371, about 26
percent of that amount, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the papers said, two sets of books were kept on the
sale of six paintings at the time of the artist's death in 1992,
for $2.5 million. One set kept in the gallery's Liechtenstein
office indicated that the money Marlborough used to pay the estate
for the paintings came from Bacon's own Swiss bank account.
</P>
<P>
   In many other cases, Eastman said, the gallery has not provided
records of its purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Marlborough furnished Eastman with records covering some
transactions over a 20-year period, but he said many of these were
incomplete or lacked documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said Eastman had been given access to all their records
but that it was difficult to determine exactly what was in the
estate. ``Marlborough has accounted for everything they were aware
of,'' she said. She said she could not comment on valuations of the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows if it's all been found and there won't be more,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the charges is the close relationship between Bacon
and Marlborough. Beston was his link to the gallery before becoming
executor, which Edward's lawyers said was a conflict of interest.
Beston, who stepped down as executor with Brass, was not sued.
Attempts to reach Beston were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Beston had the power to sign checks on Bacon's
primary checking account and to give him money when he needed it.
Brian Clarke, an artist who is now executor of the estate, said
that it was Beston's job to keep Bacon away from distractions and
that she kept a brown envelope in the gallery for spending money
for him, which he would often use to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement submitted to the court, Bacon's accountant, Hugh
Thornton Brown, said Bacon signed his tax returns before the
figures had been filled in. Brown became Bacon's accountant at the
suggestion of Theodore Goddard, which also represented Marlborough.
He said Brown, who prepared Bacon's taxes for 19 years, never met
the artist, relying on Beston's information.

VICTIM IN POLICE SHOOTING BORE FAMOUS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among Haitians, from Port-au-Prince to Flatbush
Avenue, most everyone knows the Dorismond name.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s and '60s, Andre Dorismond was a crooner with
one of Haiti's best-known bands, Webert Sicot, a 20-piece ensemble
that played to huge, adoring crowds in dance halls and clubs across
the country. And since the Dorismond family immigrated to Brooklyn,
the singer's son Charles has risen to prominence in the
Haitian-American club scene as the hit reggae artist Bigga Haitian.
</P>
<P>
   The prominence of the Dorismond name is one of the major reasons
the Haitian-American community in New York has reacted with such
fury over the death of Andre Dorismond's son Patrick, the off-duty
security guard who was shot dead on Thursday during a scuffle with
undercover officers who mistook him for a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the name, they related to the guy immediately,''
said Ricot Dupuy, the manager of Radio Soleil, a Haitian-American
station in Brooklyn that broadcasts news and music across the
metropolitan region. ``They feel a sense of connection. It's a
familiar name.''
</P>
<P>
   And that made Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's portrayal of Patrick
Dorismond all the more galling, leaders of the community said
Tuesday. For in defending the police officers involved in the
shooting, Giuliani described Dorismond not as the son of a
respected family, but as a criminal with a violent streak, a trait
the mayor strongly suggested contributed to his death.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has stoked the outrage: the
Abner Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Louima, a Haitian immigrant, was arrested _ in a case
of mistaken identity, as it turned out _ and taken to a Brooklyn
precinct station house, where a police officer sodomized him with a
stick. Soon after Louima's attack was first reported, thousands of
Haitian-Americans marched on City Hall, and the bathroom assault
quickly crystallized long-simmering tensions over what many of them
viewed as a pattern of abusive, disrespectful policing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Louima's case received major news coverage in Haiti, so
too has Patrick Dorismond's death become a major story _ in this
case the story of how the son of a beloved cultural figure ended up
dead after saying no to an undercover police officer asking him for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, Webert Sicot toured all corners in Haiti,
enticing crowds with a mixture of dance tunes and romantic ballads.
When the band pulled into a small village, it was big news.
Teen-agers would race through dusty streets, spreading the word.
Though the group was named after its saxophonist, Andre Dorismond _
its lead singer _ projected an easy star quality. His voice was
buttery smooth, his demeanor both humble and dignified.
</P>
<P>
   Dupuy's Brooklyn station has been covering all the latest
developments in the shooting. And in Haiti, Radio Haiti Inter in
Port-au-Prince and other media outlets have devoted substantial
time to it.
</P>
<P>
   Several Haitian-American leaders have angrily criticized the
mayor, saying they detected in Giuliani's words about Patrick
Dorismond a form of character assassination that, intended or not,
unfairly spilled over to all Haitian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the sons and daughters of seekers of freedom,'' said
Vladimir Rodney, a lawyer and vice chairman of the Haitian-American
Alliance, a Brooklyn-based service group. ``The mayor has done
unspeakable harm to the bond of trust between the police and our
communities.''

 &HT;    Feds hid for two days before taking Al-Amin
 &HT;    By Jack Warner and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For two days, federal agents in Alabama watched Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin, waiting for the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred miles to the northeast, Atlanta police and the
Fulton County sheriff's fugitive squad kept following leads in the
metro area, so as not to tip their hand.
</P>
<P>
   By the time agents decided to take Al-Amin, they had as many as
150 Georgia, Alabama and federal officers surrounding the shack
outside White Hall, in rural Alabama, where he was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   During his initial court appearance Tuesday in Montgomery, Ala.,
after his arrest Monday night ended a massive manhunt, Al-Amin
looked at a reporter and said quietly: ``It's a government
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Muslim cleric formerly known as H. Rap Brown, a
member of the Black Panthers in the late 1960s, is accused of
gunning down two Fulton County deputy sheriffs who were trying to
serve him with a warrant near his West End home in Atlanta on
Thursday night. One deputy died.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Orlando Whitehead, chief of the Fulton sheriff's fugitive
squad, said leaders of the agencies hunting for Al-Amin met at FBI
headquarters in Atlanta on Saturday after undercover agents sent to
Alabama on a tip spotted him.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents have said one of the clues that led authorities
to Alabama was a green Toyota 4-Runner registered in White Hall in
Al-Amin's name.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said officers feared a sudden cessation of the search
in Atlanta would lead anyone watching the operation to suspect that
Al-Amin's hideout had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after FBI agents and U.S. deputy marshals determined
where Al-Amin was hiding, they summoned FBI SWAT teams from Mobile,
Montgomery and Atlanta to secure a wide perimeter around the
tumbledown shack, which was about 100 yards through the woods from
the nearest habitation, Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, ``we had maybe 120-150 people around the
place,'' Whitehead said. When the word was given, officers began
closing in on the shack.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached, Al-Amin came out and spotted a group of
deputy marshals, Whitehead said. ``He fired two or three shots at
them, and then ran into the woods,'' Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   The woods were quickly surrounded and dog handlers from the
Alabama Department of Corrections brought in six of their
man-tracking beagles, Whitehead said. Controlled by two handlers
and followed by three heavily armed FBI SWAT officers, the dogs
plunged into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, an Alabama Air National Guard helicopter with FLIR _
Forward-Looking Infrared Radar _ hovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs picked up his scent real quick,'' Whitehead said.
``You could hear 'em baying and yipping for maybe 40 minutes. And
then the handlers radioed in that the beagles indicated `we're
right on top of him.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Al-Amin walked out of the woods unarmed and
surrendered to the dogs' handlers and FBI agents. He was wearing a
bulletproof vest, Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   A weapon believed to have been used to fire at the officers who
captured him, a .223 caliber Ruger, was found on the side of a road
nearby, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been determined whether the weapon is the assault
rifle used to kill Fulton County Deputy Ricky Kinchen, 35, and
wound his partner, Deputy Aldranon English, 28.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the officers moved in on Al-Amin's shack, six
people _ four adults and two children, all in Muslim headgear _
arrived in a black Cadillac to visit the fugitive. The Cadillac
belongs to Sahid Abdulah Salaam, a friend of Al-Amin's, said
Lowndes County Sheriff Willie Vaughner. Salaam rents a house near
the shack where Al-Amin was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   When the visitors left, officers allowed them to get out of
sight and earshot of the shack before stopping the car and
detaining them, Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Redding Pitt in Montgomery said no charges have
been filed against Salaam and the three other adults in the
Cadillac Seville. Pitt would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, Al-Amin wore tan sandals, gray sweatpants with
the pockets pulled out and a gray thermal underwear shirt. He was
represented by Selma attorney J. L. Chestnut, who said Al-Amin will
fight attempts to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is for the governor of Georgia to request his
extradition, and then we'll see how the Alabama governor
responds,'' Chestnut said. ``If I know anything about the Alabama
governor, he'll sign it, and we will fight it. Somebody said the
governor of Alabama expected the warrant to arrive tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard spoke with Alabama
officials and said his office will seek an indictment against
Al-Amin this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Cobb County police will drop charges
against Al-Amin for impersonating a police officer. Al-Amin's
failure to appear in court to answer that charge prompted the
Fulton deputies to try to arrest him near his Atlanta home last
Thursday. They were gunned down in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Cobb County charge stemmed from a May 31, 1999,
traffic stop during which Al-Amin was charged with theft by
receiving a stolen auto and no proof of insurance. Al-Amin was
driving a stolen Ford Explorer, but told police he had purchased
the car earlier that month. When he pulled out his wallet, Al-Amin
had a police badge. He told the officer he was a cop, a police
report said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, White Hall Mayor John Jackson said he had appointed
Al-Amin an auxiliary police officer in the tiny town. But Jackson
said the appointment was made on June 1, 1999 _ the day after
Al-Amin was arrested by Cobb police.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County District Attorney Pat Head said he was aware Al-Amin
had planned to claim he was an auxiliary police officer as part of
his defense in the charge of impersonating an officer.
</P>
<P>
   But Head said Al-Amin's criminal past might have presented a
problem there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me how a convicted felon could be a police officer?''
Head said. ``If they want to come in and prove that he's a
legitimate police officer then that's a defense. I don't know any
legitimate police agency that hires convicted felons. Maybe Alabama
law is different.''

 &HT;    Olympic swimmer dies in Florida car crash
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Giovanni Linscheer's friends say the
former Olympic and All-America swimmer was a rising engineer who
took time to counsel high school athletes. They can't understand
why he would drive the wrong way down Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've replayed how it could happen. We're dumbfounded,'' Rob
Feliciano, Linscheer's former Delray Beach roommate, said Tuesday.
``But we're focused on helping his grieving family.'' Florida
Highway Patrol officials say Linscheer, 29, slammed head-on into a
car driven by telephone technician Waldemar Derby, Jr., 30, of
Jupiter, on I-95 early Sunday, killing both. State driving records
show Linscheer, who recently moved from Delray Beach to
Jacksonville, had 16 traffic tickets, including four for speeding
and two for reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch-born Linscheer was twice named All-America while at
the University of Florida and competed for the South American
country of Suriname at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and
in the 1996 games in Atlanta, his brother, Enrico, said Tuesday
from Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Linscheer attended UF from 1990 to 1994, earning a bachelor's
degree in civil engineering in August 1997, university officials
said. He graduated with honors from the Bolles School, a private
high school in Jacksonville, which won the swimming state
championship in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses told investigators they saw Linscheer's Mitsubishi
Montero sports utility vehicle going south in the northbound lane
about 4:30 a.m. Sunday just before it crashed into Derby's
Chevrolet van, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Pembrook Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Both bodies were too burned to be recognizable, Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Tuesday had not yet determined why Linscheer was
going the wrong way, whether either driver was speeding, or whether
alcohol or the wet weather contributed to the crash, Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Services for Linscheer will be 4 p.m. today at St. Coleman
Catholic Church in Pompano Beach. Funeral arrangements for Derby
were unavailable Tuesday.

 &HT;    A US Airways shutdown may clip travelers' wings
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If US Airways shuts down at 12:01 a.m.
Saturday _ as it threatens to do if it can't negotiate a contract
with its 10,000 unionized flight attendants _ travel to the
Northeast from West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale could become a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding seating on other airlines will be difficult because
the load factors are so high here this time of year,'' said Jim
Reynolds, a spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International Airport. ``Depending on the destination and the date
and time, it could be a problem to book on another airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Waters, spokeswoman for Palm Beach International Airport,
said a shutdown would mean ``an awful lot of passengers concerned
about how they are going to get to their destination.''
</P>
<P>
   US Airways offers direct flights to Baltimore, Boston,
Charlotte, N.C.; Hartford, Conn.; New York; Philadelphia;
Pittsburgh; and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and its affiliates, US Airways Express and MetroJet,
are the second-largest carrier at PBIA, behind Delta Air Lines. The
US Airways trio had 19 percent of passenger traffic and 33 daily
departures in January.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, US Airways and affiliates are a
close third to Delta and Southwest Airlines. They had nearly 12
percent of passenger traffic and 30 daily departures.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has not said whether it has made arrangements for
other airlines to honor its tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should there be a shutdown, we will make every effort to
accommodate customers,'' spokesman Rick Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants has been working without a
contract for three years. After months of federal mediation,
negotiations reached an impasse last month. Mediators called a
30-day cooling-off period, which ends Saturday. The two sides are
grappling over pay, pensions, work rules and job security.
</P>
<P>
   Using a method it calls ``parity plus 1 percent,'' the company
wants to evaluate its flight attendants' pay and work rules in
relation to those at the four top airlines. The company says its
other unions have accepted the method in their contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' union says the company's proposal
actually undercuts attendants' pay by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said no way. This is a profitable airline,'' said union
spokesman Jeff Zack.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways posted net income of $197 million, or $2.64 a share,
on sales of $8.6 billion in 1999, compared to net income of $538
million, or $5.60 a share, on sales of $8.7 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants have said they wouldn't stage a mass walkout.
Instead, they would target specific flights without notice.
</P>
<P>
   They call the campaign Chaos, for Create Havoc Around Our
System. In response, US Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf threatened a
shutdown to avoid targeted walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown would include US Airways and MetroJet, but not US
Airways Express, which makes short-haul flights to Tallahassee and
other Florida destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If US Airways were to try to operate a schedule under such
conditions, in which we would not know from hour to hour which
flights the (union) would strike, our customers would lose all
confidence,'' Wolf said.

A GREAT ORCHESTRA DANCING PAST THE GRAVEYARD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Dvorak Hall in the Rudolfinum, the home
of the Czech Philharmonic on a crook of Smetana's Moldau River, is,
like this city itself, a small treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The stage, below a commanding pipe organ, projects into an
auditorium mutedly colorful in grays and tans. Magnificent columns,
beginning at balcony level, tower above on three sides, giving a
sense of height and grandeur. That upper chamber provides light,
from high windows during the day and chandeliers at night, and a
rich, reverberant acoustic.
</P>
<P>
   But the overriding impression occurs at orchestra level, where
the room seems a jewel box, with elegantly decorated walls snugly
enclosing most of the 1,000 seats, and that impression is one of
smallness and intimacy. (Alice Tully Hall, by comparison, has 1,100
seats.)
</P>
<P>
   One of fragility, even, for how can a historically great
international orchestra continue to function in the highly charged
world economy of a new century from such a tiny, antiquated base?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the size of the hall, which was completed in 1885, used
by the parliament of Czechoslovakia from 1919 to 1939 and
beautifully reconstructed from 1989 to 1992, may be the least of
the orchestra's problems. For one thing, the philharmonic spends
relatively little time there. Like many other financially
challenged performing-arts institutions in the emerging capitalist
nations of Eastern Europe, the Czech Philharmonic has found the
grass greener abroad. It performs about half of its 100 or so
concerts a year on the road.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday afternoon, led by its chief conductor, Vladimir
Ashkenazy, the orchestra gives the first of three concerts at Avery
Fisher Hall, having just completed two weeks of touring in Florida
and California. These concerts, the Philharmonic's first in New
York since 1996, present mostly Bohemian or Czech music and are
part of Lincoln Center's Prague Festival, which celebrates the 10th
anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, a few months past. The
festival began Saturday with a symposium on Prague's rich cultural
history.
</P>
<P>
   Touring is far from the whole solution, however, and not only
because of the wear and tear it exacts on players and staff. As a
state institution in a nation embroiled in an awkward transition to
a market economy, the Czech Philharmonic has suffered a drastic
reduction in subsidies in recent years but still labors under
burdensome restrictions on how it can raise money and spend what it
raises. It cannot, for example, unilaterally increase the salaries
of players, who by any reasonable standard are cruelly underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis, to be sure, is nothing new to the Czech Philharmonic,
which was formed by members of the National Theater Opera Orchestra
and gave its first concert in 1896, conducted by Antonin Dvorak in
the Rudolfinum. Indeed, the second chapter in a published history
of the Philharmonic is titled ``Krize,'' with reference to a strike
that resulted in the dismissal of the players by the theater in
1901 and the establishment of a shaky independent organization.
</P>
<P>
   Yet through it all, including artistic misdirections compounding
the financial woes of the last decade, the orchestra has maintained
not only an excellent standard of performance but also something of
its local character: a particularly rustic, woody cluck in the
woodwinds, incisive playing from the brasses, a dark depth to the
strings. The woodwinds are notable more for the individuality of
their colors than for their blend.
</P>
<P>
   If any orchestra dances better, it can only be the Vienna
Philharmonic, which may at the moment have more reason to do so.
All this, at least, to judge from limited recent experience: two
concerts and a rehearsal in Dvorak Hall, including repertory to be
performed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The characteristic sound of an orchestra, in many instances
already a casualty of the jet age and the resultant
interchangeability of players as well as maestros, is something
that seems to worry critics and connoisseurs these days more than
conductors. Engaged around the globe and at least marginally
influenced by recent notions of period performance practice,
conductors tend to prefer versatility: a shifting sonority
appropriate in weight and coloration to the composer or work in
question rather than a sound boasting local color. Ashkenazy is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are aware of their sound,'' he said of the Czech players.
``But the repertory requires a certain type of sound. That's why
more and more orchestras sound the same. Maybe there's some kind of
margin where you can retain a certain sound and still play the
repertory as it should be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy, at 62, is the ultimate musical cosmopolite. He left
Russia in 1963 as an acclaimed pianist and now lives near Lucerne,
Switzerland, with his family. After stints as principal guest
conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, music director of the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra in London and chief conductor of the Berlin
Radio Symphony Orchestra (now the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester
Berlin), he took over the Czech Philharmonic in 1998, picking up
after a series of podium misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the players, newly free to elect their leaders, voted
to hire Gerd Albrecht as principal conductor rather than extend the
contract of Jiri Belohlavek, who had taken over the year before.
Albrecht, a German, thus became the first non-Czech maestro in the
Philharmonic's storied history. The orchestra's fame was built and
sustained during the long, successive tenures of four conductors,
each a major figure internationally: Vaclav Talich from 1918 to
1934, Rafael Kubelik to 1950, Karel Ancerl to 1968 and Vaclav
Neumann to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of the players' thinking about Albrecht, apparently, was
that with his international contacts, he would attract more
recording projects for the orchestra. But as it happened, the
classical-record business was on the verge of a worldwide meltdown.
Albrecht, who took over in 1993 after Belohlavek's angry exit,
himself resigned in a fit of pique in 1996. Although no one would
say much about Albrecht's term or his departure, the circumstances
were obviously not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two camps,'' said Petr Kristian, a veteran
violinist, ``half and half.'' Albrecht, who had done much Czech
music with the orchestra before, including Dvorak operas, suddenly
seemed less interested in it, and some players are said to have
found him highhanded in manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was destructive for the orchestra when he left in the
middle of his contract,'' Ashkenazy said. After Albrecht's
departure, the gap was filled jointly by Vladimir Valek, Sir
Charles Mackerras and Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi. Valek, as permanent
guest conductor, led tours celebrating the orchestra's centennial,
including one in the United States in 1996. Ashkenazy first
conducted the orchestra in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In his own conducting career, Ashkenazy ran into a situation in
1994 somewhat like Belohlavek's. Without consulting Ashkenazy, the
Royal Philharmonic, which he had led since 1986 and with which he
had open-ended plans extending to 1997, made an offer to a
successor, Daniele Gatti. Ashkenazy resigned immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Though widely experienced by now, he has not yet achieved the
universal respect as a podium technician or interpreter that he
enjoys as a pianist. (He will be heard in both functions Monday
evening, playing and conducting Mozart's great D minor Concerto.)
But many players respond to his innate musicality, evidently the
Czechs among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good musician,'' said Jaroslav Halir, a young
trumpeter. Kristian seconded that opinion, adding that Ashkenazy,
because of his Slavic Russian roots, is sympathetic to the
orchestra's tradition and style. ( Ashkenazy rehearses the
orchestra in English, when, that is, the musical terminology itself
is not Italian.)
</P>
<P>
   And he offers advantages beyond his musicianship. ``With his
connections, he can bring in many soloists and good conductors,''
Kristian said. ``The level has improved in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Another invaluable asset, not unrelated: Ashkenazy has brought
along his powerful manager, Jasper Parrott, who is based in London.
Parrott, a longtime friend and collaborator of the conductor's,
wrote the biography ``Ashkenazy: Beyond Frontiers'' in 1985 with
Ashkenazy's help. Parrott's father, Cecil Parrott, was the British
ambassador to Czechoslovakia from 1960 to 1966, a writer about
music, the author of a biography of Jaroslav Hasek and a translator
of Hasek's ``Good Soldier Svejk.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrott has been using his own diplomatic and managerial skills
on the orchestra's behalf. For one thing, he is working with
Ashkenazy for changes in legislation and governmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Czech Republic is in some ways worse off, because it
started out better,'' Parrott said of the various Eastern European
countries still adjusting to life after communism. ``The attempt to
liberalize after the revolution was largely a fraud. It sort of
avoided problems and made things look good. Five years ago
everything hit the buffers, and it became clear how little
fundamental reform there had been. The Poles made much more
rational reforms, and now Hungary has, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for institutions in the Czech Republic to
benefit from entrepreneurial activities. Museums and
performing-arts institutions are treated in the same way as
everybody else, and they've all done badly. It's sort of equal
misery for everybody, so nobody has gone bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrott has also been helping the orchestra's administration _
the managing director, Jiri Kovar, and the new intendant, Eva
Sedlakova _ develop a modern management style based on Western
models.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Philharmonic administers the Rudolfinum as a whole,
with its performance halls and art gallery. Kovar was said to be
occupied with legal matters during a reporter's brief visit and
thus unavailable. Sedlakova was put forward as the one who runs the
orchestra day to day.
</P>
<P>
   For an American, nosing around in the Czech Philharmonic's
finances is depressing business. The overall institution's annual
budget amounts to less than $4 million. The players' average
salary, Sedlakova said, is 12,000 Czech crowns a month, which comes
to about $4,000 a year. Although comparisons at such a level are
almost beside the point, the average salary in the Vienna
Philharmonic was said last year to be $59,000, and the
(italics)starting(end italics) salary in top American orchestras
hovers near six digits.

SUSPECT IN SLAYINGS AT TEXAS CARWASH ARRESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DOMINGO RAMIREZ JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A SWAT team rushed a northeast Dallas house on
Tuesday and arrested a fired carwash employee accused of fatally
shooting his former boss and four other former co-workers and
critically injuring another on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayne Harris, 28, of the Dallas suburb of Irving, who has
a felony record, offered no resistance, police said. Harris is
expected to be charged with capital murder, said David Tull, an
Irving police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to withhold most information about the
shootings, including the type of weapon used, whether it was found,
where the victims were shot and where their bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   They also were silent about motive. The Associated Press
reported that a relative of one victim said that all of the
victims' wallets were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had been fired from the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash on Friday
after he was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure at the
carwash, according to officials at Lew Sterrett Justice Center in
Dallas. According to an Irving police report, Harris had exposed
himself while performing a sexual act.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from jail Sunday after posting $500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   A carwash employee said that Harris was at the business on
Sunday and asked for a free car wash, the AP said. He was refused.
</P>
<P>
   An employee told investigators that Harris was at the carwash
Monday morning, seconds before the employee found the victims
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Police launched a massive manhunt for Harris. They would not say
what led them to the Dallas house where he was apprehended about
10:35 a.m. CST on Tuesday, nor would they comment on whether
anything was confiscated there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people were in the house, but he was the only one
arrested,'' Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Harris also is a suspect in the disappearance
of Sandy Scott, 37, of Irving. Harris was seen with Scott shortly
before she disappeared Nov. 29, Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an acquaintance,'' Tull said. ``He was questioned
several times by investigators, but he has never been arrested in
connection with her disappearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's family members and her former husband said on Tuesday
that they fear she is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is not good,'' said Michael Wright, Scott's
ex-husband. ``I expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor of Monday's shooting, which police said may
have been a botched robbery, is Octavio Ramos, 36, of Irving. He
was in critical condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas,
a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The employees who died at the scene were identified as cashier
Rhoda Wheeler, 45, of Irving; assistant manager Dennis Lee, 48, of
Irving; and supervisor Agustin Villasenor, 36, of Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Villasenor's brother, Benjamin Villasenor, 32, of Irving, and
Roberto Jimenez Jr., 15, also of Irving, died later at Parkland
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shooting occurred between 7:30 and 7:40 a.m. The
carwash usually opens at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were found about 7:40 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   While police investigated, friends and relatives of the victims
visited the car wash. Rain and thunder didn't keep friends,
co-workers and carwash clients from bringing flowers and messages
for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit too close to home,'' Gladys Arnaud, a cashier at
another Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in Irving, said as she placed daisies
and red carnations in front of the car wash where the shootings
took place.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees wore black ribbons to remember their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had served almost eight years in prison for burglary
convictions in 1991, state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Texas prisoners in the early to mid-1990s, he served
almost his entire sentence, with few days credited for good
behavior, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen
Castlebury said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this guy had really applied himself in prison, he should
have been out ... in three years,'' Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was moved several times among prison units, another
unusual occurrence in the Texas system, Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris went to prison Sept. 25, 1991, and was released May 3
last year, records show. He was placed on parole _ also called
mandatory supervision _ for the remainder of his sentence and was
discharged June 27. He had since been unsupervised, Castlebury
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas suburb of Garland, where Harris grew up, he was
charged in two burglaries, Garland police spokesman Joel Bettes
said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1990, Harris was arrested after a burglary at an auto
parts store, police said. In May 1991, he was arrested after police
investigating a burglary found him and another man hiding in nearby
bushes, Bettes said.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1991, Harris was charged with another burglary in a
Dallas County warrant.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to all the charges and was sent to prison,
Bettes said.

TODD BODINE HAS CURE FOR MARTIN'S DOMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With victories in three of four starts, Mark
Martin is threatening to turn his final season in NASCAR's Busch
Grand National Series into an impromptu ``Victory Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   How can anybody stop Martin?
</P>
<P>
   ``Put him in an equal race car. You want to hear it, I told
ya,'' series regular Todd Bodine said during a one-day media tour
at Texas Motor Speedway on Tuesday. ``Mark Martin is a tremendous
race-car driver, there's no question about that. But right now,
he's got a tremendous aerodynamic advantage and a substantial
horsepower advantage on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The BGN series is scheduled to make its lone appearance on TMS'
1.5-mile quadoval during the Albertson's 300 on April 1. It will be
the final appearance at TMS in a Busch car for Martin, winner of
the first BGN race here in 1997. Martin plans to confine his racing
to Winston Cup beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the BGN series' all-time victory leader with 43, drives
the Busch version of the 2000 Ford Taurus. Bodine drives the BGN
version of the 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. NASCAR officials, Bodine
said, need to give the BGN Monte Carlo the same two-inch extension
to the bottom of its front valance that was granted the Winston Cup
version of the car before the Cracker Barrel 500 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   The extension cured a chronic ``aero push'' problem on the front
end of the Monte Carlo, allowing it to carry speed through the
corners. In the first race after the rule change, seven-time Cup
champion Dale Earnhardt gave the 2000 Chevy its first victory in a
side-by-side sprint to the finish over Bobby Labonte's Pontiac
Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   BGN points leader Matt Kenseth, Martin's Winston Cup teammate at
Roush Racing, won the Busch season-opener at the Daytona
International Speedway in a 2000 Chevy. Martin did not compete in
that event but has clicked off BGN victories at North Carolina
Speedway, AMS and Darlington. In the BGN race he entered but did
not win, Martin finished second to Roush stablemate Jeff Burton and
his Taurus at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, a 36-year-old native of Chemung, N.Y., is third in
series points heading into the Cheez-It 250 at Bristol Motor
Speedway on Saturday. Bodine said a critical factor being
overlooked is that the 9.5:1 compression ratio, 358 cubic-inch V-8
engines in Busch cars crank out approximately 200 fewer horsepower
than their Cup counterparts (720 HP to 520).
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Taurus, in terms of numbers, is 30 horsepower better
aerodynamically,'' said Bodine, driver of the No. 66 Phillips 66
Chevy. ``It takes 30 less horsepower to push it at the same speed
it takes a Monte Carlo. So that advantage, along with the
horsepower advantage along with the valance advantage ... you're
just not going to beat those Tauruses right now in Busch Grand
National.'' nn

 PRAGUE, Czech Republic: six digits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Czech players' average salary corresponds to that of the
citizenry as a whole and is regulated to do so. ``The budget for
salaries is fixed,'' Sedlakova said. ``It is not possible to
increase salaries even for very good players.''
</P>
<P>
   State subsidies have declined steadily to about $1.3 million a
year. ``The subsidy now covers one-third of the budget,'' Sedlakova
said, ``and we still have the same regulations as if it were
subsidized 100 percent.'' Sponsorship from corporations like the
Investment and Postal Bank and Skoda Auto amounts to perhaps
$300,000. The rest has to be earned through ticket sales and tours.
</P>
<P>
   At least the players do not have to buy their own instruments.
They may use those of the institution, and Sedlakova said the
majority do. The players stand to make additional money by
moonlighting, playing chamber music or recording film music, and
Kristian said all do. A few, he added, also teach.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sums are pathetic, and even given a relatively low
cost of living in Prague, such a scale puts the orchestra at a
clear disadvantage in the international market for top musicians.
Of the 120 players, Ashkenazy said, only one is not Czech, and that
one is Slovakian. Here, to find a silver lining, is a reason the
orchestra has been able to retain some of its old character.
</P>
<P>
   And its old habits. Only five players are women: three
violinists, who joined the orchestra in recent years, and (the
classic dodge) two harpists. ``It totally changed the atmosphere of
the orchestra when women came in,'' Sedlakova said, declining to
elaborate much. ``It just changed. The building is not built to
separate men and women. There are few rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in attracting players from outside the Czech
Republic has by no means been killing, obviously, since native
players have been good enough to lift the orchestra to its present
level. The worse problem is the converse: keeping the best Czech
players from accepting foreign opportunities, which are sure to
increase when the Czech Republic enters the European Union, perhaps
in 2003. Ashkenazy cited the case of a young Czech horn player who
eluded the orchestra's grasp, which he fears may become typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not yet destructive, but it might be,'' he said. ``The
playing itself is still at a very high level, but the morale is not
so good. The players sit there with their arms folded, thinking we
will do something for them, because that's the way it was under
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy seems to be trying his best to help. ``It takes a lot
of time and energy meeting with important people to find solutions,
meeting with this minister, that minister,'' he said. ``But if we
ever get to the point where we can do with our money what we like,
then we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one would specify Ashkenazy's salary, Parrott said
that ``his fees are substantially below his international level,
but they are at least honorable.'' He is maintaining most of the
busy schedule to which he was already committed elsewhere before
coming to the aid of the orchestra. He spends six or seven weeks a
season with the Czech Philharmonic in Prague, he said, and another
six or seven weeks on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if he could be here more,'' Sedlakova said.
She pointed out that although he had not yet taken part in player
auditions, in which he is supposed to have a vote, she hoped he
might make one next month for an opening in the horn section.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he (italics)is(end italics) here he does his
utmost,'' she added. ``The time of conductors like Ancerl and
Neumann is another world. Even if we had a very good Czech
conductor, he would mostly be abroad. The main thing is to be in
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy says he hopes to spend more time in Prague, and he is
not in any case trying to drum up new business. ``I don't like to
guest-conduct so much,'' said this most self-effacing maestro (if
that is not in fact an oxymoron). ``I'm too shy. I like to
establish relationships.'' His contract with the Czech Philharmonic
runs until next year, and an extension is being negotiated,
doubtless with understandable caution on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mustn't be too pessimistic,'' Ashkenazy said of the many
difficulties still ahead of him and the orchestra. ``We can't
predict everything. But it would be a shame to lose a great
orchestra, because you (italics)might(end italics) lose it.''

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A SWAT team rushed a northeast Dallas house on
Tuesday and arrested a fired carwash employee accused of fatally
shooting his former boss and four other former co-workers and
critically injuring another on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayne Harris, 28, of the Dallas suburb of Irving, who has
a felony record, offered no resistance, police said. Harris is
expected to be charged with capital murder, said David Tull, an
Irving police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to withhold most information about the
shootings, including the type of weapon used, whether it was found,
where the victims were shot and where their bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   They also were silent about motive. The Associated Press
reported that a relative of one victim said that all of the
victims' wallets were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had been fired from the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash on Friday
after he was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure at the
carwash, according to officials at Lew Sterrett Justice Center in
Dallas. According to an Irving police report, Harris had exposed
himself while performing a sexual act.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from jail Sunday after posting $500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   A carwash employee said that Harris was at the business on
Sunday and asked for a free car wash, the AP said. He was refused.
</P>
<P>
   An employee told investigators that Harris was at the carwash
Monday morning, seconds before the employee found the victims
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Police launched a massive manhunt for Harris. They would not say
what led them to the Dallas house where he was apprehended about
10:35 a.m. CST on Tuesday, nor would they comment on whether
anything was confiscated there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people were in the house, but he was the only one
arrested,'' Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Harris also is a suspect in the disappearance
of Sandy Scott, 37, of Irving. Harris was seen with Scott shortly
before she disappeared Nov. 29, Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an acquaintance,'' Tull said. ``He was questioned
several times by investigators, but he has never been arrested in
connection with her disappearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's family members and her former husband said on Tuesday
that they fear she is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is not good,'' said Michael Wright, Scott's
ex-husband. ``I expect the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor of Monday's shooting, which police said may
have been a botched robbery, is Octavio Ramos, 36, of Irving. He
was in critical condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas,
a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The employees who died at the scene were identified as cashier
Rhoda Wheeler, 45, of Irving; assistant manager Dennis Lee, 48, of
Irving; and supervisor Agustin Villasenor, 36, of Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Villasenor's brother, Benjamin Villasenor, 32, of Irving, and
Roberto Jimenez Jr., 15, also of Irving, died later at Parkland
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the shooting occurred between 7:30 and 7:40 a.m. The
carwash usually opens at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were found about 7:40 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   While police investigated, friends and relatives of the victims
visited the car wash. Rain and thunder didn't keep friends,
co-workers and carwash clients from bringing flowers and messages
for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit too close to home,'' Gladys Arnaud, a cashier at
another Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in Irving, said as she placed daisies
and red carnations in front of the car wash where the shootings
took place.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees wore black ribbons to remember their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had served almost eight years in prison for burglary
convictions in 1991, state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Texas prisoners in the early to mid-1990s, he served
almost his entire sentence, with few days credited for good
behavior, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Glen
Castlebury said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this guy had really applied himself in prison, he should
have been out ... in three years,'' Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was moved several times among prison units, another
unusual occurrence in the Texas system, Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris went to prison Sept. 25, 1991, and was released May 3
last year, records show. He was placed on parole _ also called
mandatory supervision _ for the remainder of his sentence and was
discharged June 27. He had since been unsupervised, Castlebury
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas suburb of Garland, where Harris grew up, he was
charged in two burglaries, Garland police spokesman Joel Bettes
said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1990, Harris was arrested after a burglary at an auto
parts store, police said. In May 1991, he was arrested after police
investigating a burglary found him and another man hiding in nearby
bushes, Bettes said.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1991, Harris was charged with another burglary in a
Dallas County warrant.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to all the charges and was sent to prison,
Bettes said.

THE GREAT VISOR DEBATE IN HOCKEY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey advertises itself as the world's fastest game, but the
safety of its players has always come slowly, if not reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltenders never wore a mask until 1959, when Jacques Plante
returned to the ice wearing one after having several stitches to
close a facial wound from a sizzling puck. When helmets were made
mandatory in 1979 for players entering the National Hockey League,
established players, notably Craig MacTavish, were allowed to
finish their careers without a helmet if they so preferred.
</P>
<P>
   And even after the 23-year-old defenseman Bryan Berard's
frightful eye injury on March 11, most NHL players continue to
spurn a protective plastic eye visor.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, accidentally struck in the right eye by the stick-blade
of Ottawa's Marian Hossa, underwent exploratory surgery Tuesday at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. If he doesn't regain his
sight in that eye, his career is over; the NHL does not allow a
player to risk losing his sight in both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that several of Berard's teammates on the
Toronto Maple Leafs would have hurried to put on a visor in order
to protect themselves from a similar injury, but only one did,
Sergei Berezin; three others have worn a visor all season _ Yanic
Perreault, Nikolai Antropov and Alyn McCauley.
</P>
<P>
   In the great visor debate, the other Maple Leafs and most NHL
players think that a visor is either too hot, too foggy or too
cumbersome, if not too sissified. As if they were exempt from a
stick in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NHL office, according to Frank Brown, its vice
president for media relations, ``would be happy'' to discuss the
mandatory use of visors with the NHL Players Association, the union
position is that wearing a visor should be up to each player.
</P>
<P>
   The union's director of business relations, Mike Gartner, the
fifth-leading career goal scorer with 708 in 19 seasons, endorses
that stance even though he wore a visor most of his career after a
serious eye injury; he couldn't see out of his left eye for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the benefits of a visor far outweigh the risks, but I
believe in a player's choice,'' Gartner has said. ``Hockey in
itself is a dangerous game even if you were to go out there in full
body armor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Dryden, the Hall of Fame goaltender of another era who
is now the Maple Leafs' president, predicted that eventually ``the
visor will happen'' throughout the NHL, just as helmets and
goaltenders' masks happened, and that more players will use visors
in training camp next September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will be willing to wear a visor after thinking it
over during the summer,'' Dryden said.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden remembered that it took two or three seasons after Plante
pioneered the mask before another NHL goaltender, Terry Sawchuk,
wore a mask.
</P>
<P>
   Other goaltenders of that era complained that a mask was too
heavy, too hot, too restrictive of their vision _ not that
different from the later complaints about a helmet and the current
complaints about a visor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 12-year-old goaltender without a mask when Plante wore
the mask for the first time,'' Dryden said. ``I didn't wear a mask
until 1965, my freshman year at Cornell, when I had to wear one.
And years later the helmet to the other players was like the mask
to the goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they had to wear a helmet, they found out it wasn't
so bad after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 New Jersey Devils who wear a visor, six are from
Europe, where a visor is mandatory in some countries. After
Berard's injury, the Devils' young John Madden put on a visor but
found it too distracting.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Rangers, notably Brian Leetch, regularly wear a visor.
John MacLean is also wearing one following a recent eye injury.
Theo Fleury has worn one occasionally. Mathieu Schneider wore a
visor at two Garden games last week after Berard's injury but on
the road over the weekend, he didn't like the way it fit his blue
road helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Two Islanders, Olli Jokinen and Dmitri Nabokov, have worn visors
since Berard's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Berard incident definitely opened my eyes,'' said Jokinen,
who wore a visor in his native Finland. ``I don't care if people
call me chicken. My sight and my career are more important.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the great visor debate, too many NHL players' eyes are
still closed.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Gerry Hunsicker has orchestrated blockbuster
deals and kept the Astros on top in the National League Central
despite limited resources.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But ask him about the toughest decision he has had to make since
taking over as the Astros' general manager prior to the 1996
season, and he'll tell you it's staring him right in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Seven infielders, six outfielders or three catchers? That's the
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   All three totals would represent one more player than normally
carried on a conventional 25-man roster. But the Astros' success
over the past few years has not come without a few gambles or
unconventional means of getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the roster is Hunsicker's primary task at this time of
year. To the casual fan, the six weeks of spring training is an
exercise designed to determine the best 25 players in camp, those
worthy of a spot on the opening-day roster.
</P>
<P>
   But with apologies to purists, opening day is a bit overrated.
Fact is, few teams actually leave spring training with their best
25 players. Inevitably, circumstances dictate that at least a
couple of worthy candidates start the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   In the Astros' case, those players could include the likes of
Glen Barker and Mitch Meluskey. Both belong in the majors, but
neither is assured of a spot because they still have options and
are competing against players who are out of options. Players who
are out of options must clear waivers before they can be sent to
the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a couple of people who don't make this
team who haven't done anything to play themselves off the club,''
Hunsicker said. ``It's really going to come down to what areas we
want to protect the most, which weapons we think are most valuable.
Part of it is evaluating how (manager) Larry (Dierker) manages _
the moves he likes to make, what he likes to do and how people will
be utilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the players the Astros decide to begin the season
with might not be the same players taking the field in September.
They used 36 players last season, mainly because injuries forced
them to use the disabled list 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be lucky to get out of April with the 25 guys we leave
here with,'' Dierker said. ``It's not how you start; it's how you
finish that counts. To me, depth doesn't end with the 25th man on
the big-league roster. It ends with the 10th guy at Triple-A. You'd
like to have all of the positions backed up. Regardless of where
the depth is spread out, it's still important.''
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Hunsicker to make certain that depth is available.
When it looks like the Astros have too many outfielders because
Daryle Ward and Lance Berkman are not in the starting lineup, it's
because Hunsicker knows how quickly injuries can change the face of
a team.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker could have traded either player 10 times over, but
doing so would have significantly weakened the Astros' overall
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Ward will be on the opening-day roster as the Astros' fourth
outfielder, and Hunsicker said it's possible that both Barker and
Matt Mieske _ the two players competing for what was believed to be
the final spot in the outfield _ will make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker also said opening the season with three catchers is a
possibility, although it's something the club never has done under
the current regime. Tony Eusebio and Paul Bako appear to be locks,
although Meluskey's spring has been impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final decision, it will be made with the idea of
controlling inventory in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been agonizing over this decision as much as any decision
since I've been here,'' Hunsicker said. ``You can make a case for
all of the options. We're going to have to make some tough
decisions, but either way I think we're going to be OK as far as
depth.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a sharp blow to
the Clinton administration's efforts to curb smoking, ruling 5-4
that the Food and Drug Administration had never received authority
from Congress to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, rejecting rules that the FDA proposed in 1995 to
restrict the marketing of cigarettes to minors, hands the question
of national tobacco regulation back to Congress. An effort to
confer jurisdiction on the FDA won some bipartisan support in
Congress in 1998 but became mired in a broader debate over whether
to give the cigarette industry immunity from damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling was notable for the strong language that both
the majority and the dissenting opinions used in describing the
dangers of smoking, which causes some 400,000 deaths a year in the
United States. Although essentially a straightforward ruling on a
question of administrative law, the decision paid more than usual
attention to the underlying policy issues, as if in recognition
that the debate will continue elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was welcomed by the industry, but it left cigarette
makers still obligated to pay hundreds of billions of dollars to
settle lawsuits to recover state health care costs. It also
prompted both Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush to
call for congressional enactment of stricter controls on tobacco
products.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who said in her majority opinion
that the FDA had ``amply demonstrated'' that tobacco use was
``perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in
the United States,'' sounded at times almost apologetic for her
conclusion that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which the agency
used to assert jurisdiction, could not be stretched far enough to
accommodate the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In the dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that
given nicotine's highly addictive nature and the ``life-threatening
harms'' of smoking, the FDA's authority should be interpreted in
light of ``its basic purpose _ the overall protection of public
health.'' He said the court should avoid an ``overly rigid''
interpretation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ``that is
divorced from the statute's overall health-protecting purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David A. Kessler, the former FDA commissioner who led the
agency in reversing its long-held position that it could not
regulate tobacco, said Tuesday that the loss in court had ``in some
ways moved the issue forward'' through the justices' recognition of
the dimensions of the problem as a public-health issue. ``We're in
a very different place than we were five years ago,'' said Kessler,
now the dean of Yale Medical School, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority Tuesday applied a settled principle of
administrative law: if Congress has spoken clearly on a question of
an agency's jurisdiction, or lack of jurisdiction, Congress has the
last word. ``The FDA's claim to jurisdiction contravenes the clear
intent of Congress,'' O'Connor said. The dispute between the
majority and dissent was over the clarity of Congress' intent,
which the dissent found to be much less evident.
</P>
<P>
   The decision upheld a 1998 ruling by the 4th Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals, in Richmond, Va. Four cigarette manufacturers _ Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co.
and U.S. Tobacco Co. _ along with the National Association of
Convenience Stores had gone to federal court to challenge the
regulations as soon as the FDA formally issued them in 1996. A 1997
ruling by Judge William L. Osteen Sr. of U.S. District Court in
Greensboro, N.C., upheld the agency's jurisdiction over controlling
children's access to cigarettes, but struck down the regulations'
restrictions on advertising and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the authority of the district court's decision, the FDA
has since 1997 been spending about $34 million a year on contracts
with the 50 states to help monitor compliance with state laws
barring the sale of cigarettes to those under 18. The FDA on
Tuesday began to send letters to the states announcing an ``orderly
shutdown'' of the compliance program in light of the Supreme Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion in the case decided Tuesday, Food and Drug
Administration vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson, No. 98-1152, was joined by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justices John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Breyer's dissenting
opinion.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This particular 5-4 split has become familiar during the last
few years, with the more conservative justices on one side and the
relatively more liberal ones on the other. Yet there was nothing
overtly ideological about the essentially historical question of
whether a 1938 statute, or any subsequent legislative developments,
conferred jurisdiction on a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   But a distrust of the power of administrative agencies has long
been a watchword of legal conservatives, and this case reached the
court within a broader context of renewed ferment over the
constitutional boundaries of the modern administrative state.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Washington issued a startling
decision last year, holding that in authorizing the Environmental
Protection Agency to issue certain regulations under the Clean Air
Act, Congress engaged in an unconstitutional ``delegation'' of its
legislative powers to an executive branch agency. As the justices
were undoubtedly aware, the Clinton administration has recently
asked them to review that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion Tuesday, Breyer appeared to go out of
his way to refute any suggestion that an agency's action is
insulated from political accountability. ``Insofar as the decision
to regulate tobacco reflects the policy of an administration, it is
a decision for which that administration, and those politically
elected officials who support it, must (and will) take
responsibility,'' Breyer said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that an administrative agency decision of
this magnitude _ one that is important, conspicuous, and
controversial _ can escape the kind of public scrutiny that is
essential in any democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA regulations were based on the premise that most people
who become lifelong smokers start smoking in their early teens. To
discourage teen-age smoking, the regulations prohibited the sale of
cigarettes to those under 18; the distribution of free samples or
the sale of packages of fewer than 20 cigarettes; and the use of
self-service displays or vending machines except in adults-only
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers were required to verify, through photo identification,
the age of all purchasers younger than 27. There were also
restrictions on outdoor advertising near playgrounds and schools
and on promotional items and sponsorship of various events by
cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency claimed its authority under the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, which gives it jurisdiction to regulate ``drugs'' and
``devices.'' Drugs are defined in the 1938 law as articles, other
than food, ``intended to affect the structure or any function of
the body.'' Nicotine was such a substance, the FDA said, and
cigarettes were devices for delivering nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's assertion of authority over tobacco in 1995 came after
decades of disclaiming such jurisdiction. The agency justified its
about-face by pointing to newly disclosed internal cigarette
industry documents showing that the industry understood and
intended to achieve nicotine's effects _ thus meeting for the first
time the statute's requirement that any effect be intentional.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry objected immediately that Congress had
never meant to give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco. Parsing the
statute, industry lawyers provided a syllogism that the majority
today found persuasive. The agency's core mission, the industry
argued, was to make sure that drugs reaching the market were safe
and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Because the FDA found cigarettes to be unsafe, it was required
under the law not simply to regulate them but to ban them. But, the
argument went on, Congress clearly did not intend that result,
because since 1938, it has passed a half-dozen measures dealing
with smoking that were obviously based on the assumption that
cigarettes would continue to be marketed. The notion that the FDA
could treat tobacco as it would an ordinary drug was simply
misbegotten, the industry said.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting that argument, O'Connor said Tuesday that ``the
inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco
products'' within the law's structure. ``If they cannot be used
safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned,
they simply do not fit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Where the majority found certainty, the dissent found Congress'
treatment of smoking to be ``critically ambivalent'' in several
important respects. For administrative law purposes, the difference
between congressional clarity and ambiguity is crucial, because
once the court decides that Congress has spoken ambiguously about
an agency's authority, its precedents require judges to defer to
the agency's view of the matter.

DIABETES DRUG LINKED TO LIVER FAILURE TO BE REMOVED FROM MARKET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday evening that
Rezulin, a diabetes drug linked to liver failure, would be removed
from the market immediately.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million Americans are now taking the drug, and the
FDA urged them not to stop without first contacting their doctors
to obtain other treatment, including two recently approved safer
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin, also known by the generic name troglitazone, has been
prescribed to lower blood sugar in people with Type 2, or
adult-onset, diabetes, the most common form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which is manufactured by Parke-Davis, a division of
Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., had been criticized by
consumer safety groups and generated negative news reports during
the last year, because in rare instances it caused serious liver
damage and death.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction in March 1997, Rezulin has been linked to
90 cases of liver failure, resulting in 63 deaths and necessitating
10 liver transplants, according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the transplant recipients died. Ten other patients
recovered from severe liver failure, and 10 others are still
suffering from that condition.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of cases of liver failure was small compared with
the 1.9 million people who have taken the drug at one time or
another, and the FDA initially decided to keep Rezulin on the
market despite the risk, because it had a unique mode of action and
did help many patients.
</P>
<P>
   When Rezulin was marketed in 1997, it was the first in a class
of drugs that lowered blood sugar by making the body more sensitive
to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. In 1999,
the FDA approved two other drugs in the same class, Actos, marketed
by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries, and Avandia,
made by SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was the subject of a contentious FDA hearing a year ago,
in response to reports of 43 cases of liver failure, including 28
deaths. That hearing, which drew an overflow crowd of doctors,
patients, drug company executives and consumer advocates, resulted
in a decision to leave the drug on the market, but with the
recommendations that it be used only when other therapies did not
work, and that its label carry strong warnings about potential
liver toxicity and the need for regular blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research at the FDA, said the agency had changed its position
on Rezulin because data on the two newer drugs showed them to be
safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that they don't pose the kind of liver
toxicity that Rezulin does,'' Woodcock said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the newer drugs might also cause liver abnormalities,
but were not as risky as Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Patients taking Actos and Avandia, like those on Rezulin, are
told that they must have regular liver tests so that they can stop
taking the drug if abnormalities show up.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of the evaluation center,
said that if the two newer drugs had not become available, the FDA
would probably have left Rezulin on the market, because it was
important to have a drug of its type available.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we have other products that can give patients the same
benefit without having to assume that risk,'' Lumpkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Corr, president of research and development for
Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis, said, ``This certainly did take us by
surprise. We still believe that the benefits outweigh the risks and
that this drug produces enormous benefits for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Corr said the company would write letters to doctors telling
them that Rezulin was taken off the market, but he said he did not
know whether patients would be given refunds for leftover supplies
of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Rezulin in 1999 totaled $773 million, according to IMS
Health, a company that tracks the drug industry. Avandia had sales
of $133 million that year, its first year on the market. Actos had
$60 million in sales. But by February of this year, doctors had
begun writing more prescriptions for Avandia than for Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they were still reviewing allegations made
last week by Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer
safety group, claiming that Parke-Davis knew of the drug's liver
toxicity before it was approved, but delayed compiling and sending
that information to the FDA until after Rezulin was marketed. The
company said the allegations were false. Public Citizen has been
calling for Rezulin's recall for more than a year.

 &HT;    Ruling reaffirms right of Elian's father to decide boy's future
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat and Monika Gonzalez Mesa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Family members fighting to keep Elian Gonzalez in the
United States lost a critical decision Tuesday when a federal judge
ruled that U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno was on solid ground
when she ordered the 6-year-old boy returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno acted within her authority when she denied Elian the right
to apply for political asylum, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore
said in a 50-page order that reaffirmed the father's right to
decide the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   Moore made a plainly worded appeal that Elian's interests be
placed above all others, saying ``each passing day is another day
lost between Juan Gonzalez and his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami remained calm Tuesday, unlike the explosive street
demonstrations that followed the federal government's January
announcement that Elian would be returned to his father, a hotel
worker who lives near the Varadero resort on Cuba's north coast.
Elian's mother drowned during her sea journey to bring her son to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Grim-faced relatives told reporters in Miami on Tuesday they
will now rely on faith to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to lose. We're going to keep praying,'' Lazaro
Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle who filed the lawsuit seeking
asylum for Elian, told about 25 supporters who waited throughout
the afternoon outside his home, still adorned with Christmas
lights. The supporters held open a 14-foot Cuban flag and
alternated between protest chants against President Clinton and
support chants for Elian. They prayed and sang the Cuban national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 p.m. Lazaro Gonzalez returned with Elian, who smiled,
held up both hands way above his head and waved at the crowd before
shyly running to the fence outside the modest home.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage a sudden deportation of Elian, his attorneys filed
an appeal just before 5 p.m. to challenge Moore's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she is evaluating whether the INS will return Elian to
Cuba before appeals are exhausted, adding that it's her goal to
reunite the boy with his father as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for this little boy, who has been through so much,
to move on with his life at his father's side,'' Reno told
reporters. She declined to reveal when and how a reunification
would take place, but said it would be ``orderly, fair and
prompt.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Russ Bergeron
said the agency was beginning ``to move forward on the process''
for returning the boy. ``There could be any number of options
involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If appeals drag on for months, immigration experts say Elian
might qualify under a controversial U.S. law that allows Cubans to
apply for permanent residency after spending a year on U.S. soil.
Elian would be eligible Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say the government has a victory, but it might
be a pyrrhic victory because of the period of time under the Cuban
Adjustment Act,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the
University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   While family members said they would accept a court ruling on
Elian's fate, one of their attorneys said Moore's three-hour
hearing March 9 was not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian has not had his day in court,'' said Spencer Eig, an
attorney for Lazaro Gonzalez. ``But today's ruling gives us hope
that after we complete the entire legal process, including appeals
and reconsiderations, he just may.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attorney says the failure of the boy's father to
retrieve his son is suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 3 1/2 months he has not come for his child,'' said
Kendall Coffey, the former U.S. attorney for South Florida who is
working with the Miami family. ``We assume that if by now he has
not come it is either because he cannot come or he will not come.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys appealed Moore's decision to the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta and said they would go to the U.S.
Supreme Court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS routinely deports undocumented immigrants who lose
lower court decisions unless the appeals court issues an order to
suspend actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family's appeal does not stay the judge's order,'' said
Ira Kurzban, a prominent immigration attorney in Miami. ``In
comparable situations, the attorney general will simply deport
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Elian cannot claim he was denied his constitutional
rights because he was not legally admitted into the United States
as an immigrant. While most Cubans intercepted at sea are
repatriated, Elian was transported to a hospital for humanitarian
reasons and was allowed a temporary stay until his immigration
status could be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's recorded past is a profile of survival and courage in
the face of adversity and the loss of his mother at sea,'' Moore
wrote in his decision. ``His future will undoubtedly unfold in due
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, where mass demonstrations for Elian's return have been
a weekly routine since December, newscasters Tuesday advised Cubans
``not to fall into false optimism or excessive hope'' over the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the ruling, Moore's entire decision was posted
on the Web site for Cuba's Communist Party newspaper Granma under a
daily update on the ``kidnapping of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling renewed political debate in Washington over the boy's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.), who has sponsored a bill to grant
Elian American citizenship, said he was ``disappointed in the
federal court's decision and (Reno's) judgment in denying a
political asylum hearing to a boy who survived the seas in an
escape of an oppressive regime.'' An aide to Mack said no decision
had been made on whether to revive the citizenship bill, which has
been languishing since the courts became involved in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), who filed a companion citizenship
bill in the House, said the court's decision ``leaves no recourse
except for Congress to take the matter out of the hands of the INS
and allow this child's case to be decided by a custody hearing in a
Florida state court ... which can only happen now if Elian is
granted U.S. citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan
Burton (R-Ind.), who had subpoenaed Elian in January in an attempt
to thwart any sudden effort to return him to Cuba, said there were
no plans to have the boy testify before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush on Tuesday
suggested custody of Elian be decided by a state court, ``not by a
Clinton-Gore Justice Department whose record of putting politics
ahead of the law does not inspire confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A family judge in Miami-Dade County awarded temporary legal
custody of Elian to Lazaro Gonzalez but has not taken further
action. Moore said in his decision that he had no comment on the
state court, which is not binding on INS decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exile radio stations in Miami lamented Tuesday's events
while protest organizers prepared to meet this morning to discuss
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martyrdom can happen while you are still living,'' said Jose
Basulto, president of Brothers to the Rescue, one of the groups in
January's protests. ``That's what he's going to become if he goes
back _ a posterchild for Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for an anti-Castro group in West Palm Beach that
contributed to the Gonzalez family defense fund said Elian would be
subject to repression and indoctrination if returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would go back into the hands of the devil, which is Fidel
Castro,'' said Franciso Tabernilla, secretary of Pro-Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S. officials think allowing Elian to stay could
disrupt efforts to recover American children pirated abroad by a
foreign parent.
</P>
<P>
   Mary A. Ryan, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs,
said in a sworn statement cited in Elian's case that failure to
reunite Elian with his father will weaken the ability of American
parents and their government in their bid to have these children
returned home.

-- Yosef Bienenstock, 80, at his brother's relocated grave in
Israel. Bienenstock's family had lived in the Polish town of
Wadowice, where they grew up next door to Lolek, a brainy Catholic
kid who went on to become Pope John Paul II. Bienenstock returned
to get his little brother's bones in 1992. Expecting a tin
tombstone, he found a marble monument in its place. ``How can this
be?'' he asked the gravekeeper, who explained that the pope had
visited, and had quietly replaced his former neighbor's pathetic
grave marker. (Rina Castelnuovo/The New York Times)

<P>
   DaimlerChrysler A.G. is in the final stage of talks with
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. about acquiring 33.4 percent of the
Japanese automobile maker, and an announcement could come by the
end of this week, executives close to the talks said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains unclear how much DaimlerChrysler would pay for
Mitsubishi, based on the company's market capitalization, the deal
would be worth about $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A DaimlerChrysler deal with Mitsubishi illustrates the
German-American auto giant's desire to gain a foothold in Asia,
where much of the global growth in auto sales is expected over the
next decade. Presently, Asia represents just 3 percent of
DaimlerChrysler's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with Mitsubishi also reflects the increasingly
difficult problems faced by some of the weaker Japanese automakers,
which now find they must reach out to foreign partners to be
competitive. Renault of France purchased a 34 percent stake in the
Nissan Motor Co. a year ago, for example, and Ford Motor has
strengthened its management control over Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's chief executive, Jurgen E. Schrempp, hinted at
a deal with an Asian auto company at a news conference Tuesday in
Sindelfingen, Germany, to introduce a new Mercedes C-Class sedan.
``If we see opportunities in Asia, we will grasp them,'' he said.
``I assume this will take place very soon.'' To some extent, the
proposed alliance illustrates the success of DaimlerChrysler in the
American market, which is the world's most profitable, and the
failure of Mitsubishi in the same market.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler faces fierce competition and narrow profit
margins in Europe, while Mitsubishi is stuck with a domestic market
in Japan that has shrunk by nearly half over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But while DaimlerChrysler has prospered in the United States,
partly through its acquisition of the Chrysler Corp. but also by
designing popular Mercedes cars and sport utility vehicles,
Mitsubishi has floundered with a tiny market share, little brand
awareness and a sexual harassment scandal three years ago that
distracted management.
</P>
<P>
   Honda and Toyota have been able to balance the weakness of their
home market with profits in the United States, where Honda has 9.8
percent of the market and Toyota 10.2 percent. But Mitsubishi had
to offer deep discounts to even capture 2.3 percent of the market
last year.

 Biotech Rebound Forecast  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Leading analysts detected signs of a rebound in biotech stocks
yesterday after a disastrous slide caused in part by misplaced
fears that political leaders were intent on curtailing gene
patents.
<P>
   ``Buyers are telling us they sense a bottom out there,'' said
Tom Dietz, analyst with Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks, which had tripled in recent months, began losing
ground earlier this month, a decline that reached near panic
proportions last week after President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair made statements about gene patents that spooked
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The sector's rise and fall is mirrored by the 200 stocks in the
Nasdaq biotech stock index, which peaked at 1,597 on March 6 _ more
than three times its April 19th close of 427 _ only to plummet to
1,073 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, however, this index gained 1 percent to close at
1,102, and though the gain seems anemic, Jim McCamant, editor of
the Medical Technology Stock Letter, said intraday trading suggests
the sector has hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant said many stocks overcame big dips in early trading
yesterday to end the day with gains, as bargain hunters returned.
Among the firms that benefited from this trend were Fremont's
Abgenix Inc., which sank as low as $150 but managed to close up
$1.88 at $201.38. Incyte Pharmaceuticals also sank to $90, but
ended the day at $118.53, a 10 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic kind of turn,'' McCamant said. ``Whenever
you get strong volatility on the downside, and a big bounce, that's
the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The market gave other signs it was warming to biotech. Mountain
View's Aclara Biosystems, which went public yesterday at $21, ended
the day at $30. The company makes chips that automate lab
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Aclara's performance should embolden other biotech
IPOs _ as many as 50 are lined up. Dietz, the Pacific Equities
analyst, said he will be watching two IPOs scheduled for later this
week. Intermune Pharmaceuticals and IntraBiotics Pharmaceuticals
both have biotech products in late stage clinical trials, and Dietz
thinks their success will signal biotech is back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these hopeful signs, there were still some negative
indicators yesterday. The BioCentury 100, an index compiled by the
trade newsletter in San Carlos, dropped 3 percent yesterday &LR; .
However, BioCentury Publisher Dave Flores said yesterday's loss was
certainly preferable to the 13 percent beating the index took on
Monday, and its 18 percent loss last week.
</P>
<P>
   Flores wasn't ready to declare a rebound. ``The biotech sector
doesn't have a lot of experience with volatility,'' Flores said.
``We'll have to wait longer to figure out whether this is the
bottom, or whether we'll continue to fluctuate, and if so, by how
much.''
</P>
<P>
   One point seemed clear. Last week's plunge was exacerbated by an
exodus of momentum investors, who poured into biotech in January
and February, inflating the bubble. Robert Adler, president of AMG
Services, the mutual fund tracking firm, said money flowed out of
biotech and health care funds last week _ for the first time this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of the mo-mo money move out,'' said Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent slide, the Nasdaq biotech stock index is
still up 25 percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent
rise in the overall Nasdaq composite and a 5 percent decline in the
Dow Jones industrial average.

 (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Design has abandoned Socrates for Nietzsche. This is
the take-away idea at the first edition of the National Design
Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. No more pure geometric
shapes. No more strict correspondences between form and function.
No more efforts to refine materials and production methods to their
pure Platonic essence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we behold room after room of dancing stars. Fluid
shapes. Appetizing colors. Laughter in the dark. Flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the curatorial team of Donald Albrecht, Ellen
Lupton and Steven Skov Holt, this is the first of a series of
surveys to be conducted every three years by the Cooper-Hewitt, the
Smithsonian Institution's New York venue for the study and
exhibition of design.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural version, subtitled ``Design Culture Now,''
presents projects conceived or completed since 1997 by 83
architects, designers and firms. In addition to the customary
design fields _ appliances, graphics, furniture and assorted
accessories _ the show includes fashion, architecture, interiors,
landscapes, film, video, computer animation and sets for movies and
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The projects are not organized by discipline but presented in a
sequence of eight themes: Physical, Minimal, Reclaimed, Branded and
Fluid, to name a few. Fluid sums up the whole show. The themes flow
and swirl into and around each other like dancers in a Dionysian
revel.
</P>
<P>
   The operating logic here is intuitive rather than analytic, and
it reflects the state of design as well as the sensibility of the
field's leading figures. Even without including the work of
European designers, this show makes design look like the most
fertile artistic field in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   The fluidity invites viewers to give the show some shape. Here's
my contour. Design's movement in a Nietzschean direction has been
evident for more than 30 years. From Arts and Crafts to the Bauhaus
to the Good Design shows in the 1950s at the Museum of Modern Art,
designers had aimed to distill the ethos of industrial civilization
into practical tools for everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, designers like Ettore Sottsass, Andrea Branzi,
Gaetano Pesce and James Wines opposed the rationalist mentality of
modern design. Their work dealt with emotional content: subliminal
impulses, cultural memories, subconscious images. More recently,
Philippe Starck has injected Surrealism into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the irrational impulse has been identified with
a small constellation of designers. What the Cooper-Hewitt show
reveals is the extent to which Dionysus now rules over mainstream
design. No big-name designer comes attached to Apple's iMac and
iBook, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But these electronic Lolitas could be the symbols of this show.
With their lollipop colors, swelling lines and toylike ease of
operation, they hark back to the sexy red plastic Valentine
typewriter Sottsass designed for Olivetti in 1969. And the
popularity of these machines demonstrates the degree to which
design today is erotically driven.
</P>
<P>
   The two Apples also embody the major catalyst for this
transformation: the personal computer. Many projects in the show
explore the formal possibilities opened up by software technology.
Greg Lynn's ``Hydrogen House,'' Neil Denari's ``Smooth House,''
David Small's ``Talmud Project'' are all exercises in computer
imaging. Their sinuous forms would not be possible without software
originally developed for animation, special effects and automobile
styling.
</P>
<P>
   But if the medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan insisted,
these forms may be less important than the tools that shape them.
New media create new environments. Computers were instrumental in
designing many of the objects on view. They are also continuing to
transform our view of the world in which designed objects are
placed.
</P>
<P>
   The illusory world depicted in the 1999 movie ``The Matrix''
could well stand for this shift in perception. Created by
artificial intelligence, the illusion of normal life is produced by
streams of 0s and 1s in a state of constant flux. The computer has
reduced all information to this binary system. Suppose that human
intelligence is artificial. 0 stands for unity, for a void
undifferentiated in space and time. 1 stands for an initial act of
differentiation: the division of light from darkness, for example,
or of black from white, male from female, nature from culture, left
from right.
</P>
<P>
   In working on the computer, we are always returning to unity and
always stepping away from it. Whatever forms we create on the
screen, we are always recreating and destroying the void.
</P>
<P>
   Nietzsche would have recognized this as a primal creative
operation. It is more instinctive than analytic. Take one step, and
the void is divided. Another step, and it splits once again. The
process is violent and even tragic, because with each step unity
recedes ever further into the distance, leaving in its place a
sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of design is the Design Triennial's subterranean
theme. The entire show is one long bunny hop of 0s and 1s, snaking
its way through Andrew Carnegie's stately mansion in a perverse
rite of mourning. The message of Dionysian drama, Nietzsche wrote
in ``The Birth of Tragedy,'' is that ``we are to regard the state
of individuation as the origin and primal cause of all suffering,
as something objectionable in itself.'' Tragedy is seldom evident
on the show's surface. You can easily make your way through it just
enjoying the pleasing play of ideas, shapes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   But the lively surface is part of the underlying message of loss
and compensation. 0 is lost, and the compensation is an infinite
number of combinations of 0 plus 1. Unity is lost, and the
consolation prize is a shiny computer fresh out of the box, and the
next computer, and the one after that, the computer you've really
been waiting for.

 Visa Quota Met for Overseas Workers  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Bay Area employers lost one way of filling technology job
openings yesterday when the Immigration and Naturalization Service
stopped accepting new applications for H-1B visas, the permits that
allow foreign nationals with college degrees to work in the United
States.
<P>
   The agency has already received enough applications to fill this
year's quota of 115,000 visas. Last year, visa availability ran out
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Several bills have been introduced in Congress seeking to
increase the H-1B quota to as much as 200,000 for fiscal year 2001.
But even if the bills become law, the new quotas won't go into
effect until the fiscal year begins on October 1 _ leaving
worker-hungry technology companies high and dry for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, which employs between 500 and 800 H-1B workers,
is trying to hire 2,700 people for mostly technical jobs in its
U.S. locations. Not being able to hire foreign candidates will hurt
hiring efforts and could possibly damage the company's
profitability, said HP spokeswoman Mary Dee Beall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the best-qualified candidate is American, you can't
fill the job for six months. Some of our product cycles are as
short as six months,'' Beall said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from leaving positions open, HP may consider hiring
foreign applicants to a work at one of the company's overseas
locations and keeping them there ``until the quota is restored,''
Beall said.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical solution, ``We could move the job overseas,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems is also considering employing foreign nationals
at overseas locations instead of at its Palo Alto headquarters.
However, since  &LR; because many of the foreign workers Sun wants to
hire are already in the United States _ as students or recent
graduates of U.S. universities _ Sun has to pay the price of
relocating the hires to overseas locations, about $200,000 per
employee, said Heidi Wilson, the company's corporate immigration
manager.
</P>
<P>
   While giant companies such as Sun and HP make the most noise
pushing for more H-1B workers by hiring lobbyists to push for
changes in the law, small Internet startups feel the pinch, too.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Greene, chief executive and president of Emeryville's
HealthCentral.com, joined the technology lobbying group TechNet
mainly because he believes something needs to be done about the
shortage of high-tech workers. HealthCentral.com publishes
health-related content for consumers, and the company also creates
customized Web interfaces that help hospitals and other large
medical organizations communicate with their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said the company has had to turn away projects because he
doesn't have enough staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now starting to talk to overseas companies to contract
(programming and Web design) work out,'' said Greene, who has one
H-1B employee.
</P>
<P>
   One company that stands to benefit from the halt in visas is
ITSquare.com, a San Jose Web company that helps companies outsource
software design projects. About 25 percent of the design companies
that bid on jobs at ITSquare.com are based outside the United
States, but U.S. companies who buy their services don't have to
deal with visa hassles because they're not hiring anyone _ they're
just contracting for their services.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months since the company's launch, it has helped
mostly dot-coms and other startups outsource their software work.
But in the past week, CEO Harvi Sachar said he received phone calls
from three large Bay Area companies _ which he would not name _ who
said they were interested in using ITSquare.com's service because
H-1B visas would be unavailable for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ubiquitous assertion from technology companies that
skilled workers are a scarce commodity right now, some critics
allege that companies such as Sun and HP are passing over qualified
American applicants, especially older computer programmers who
could easily be retrained to fill the open jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a shortage of applicants,'' said Norman
Matloff, a professor of computer science at the University of
California at Davis who wrote a paper titled ``Debunking the Myth
of a Desperate Software Labor Shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Matloff said, technology companies interview
only about 10 percent of job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies would have no trouble filling their open
jobs if they let experienced tech workers learn new skills on the
job instead of searching for applicants with the exact skills
required, such as knowledge of the Java programming language,
Matloff said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the local companies contacted for this story planned
to respond to the end of the H-1B quota by training more American
citizens or residents to fill open jobs. Instead, they stressed
that the positions usually filled by H-1B workers usually require a
doctorate or other hard-to-find qualifications.

 NEW YORK: waiting for.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several projects in the show deal explicitly with the tragic
dimension. In his designs for Julie Taymor's 1999 movie ``Titus,''
Dante Derretti uses Italian architecture from the Fascist period to
set the stage for an antique bloodbath. Lebbeus Woods's
``Civilization,'' a project to be exhibited at full scale in Vienna
this summer, is a Schwitters-like composition whose piercing,
angular forms depict the decline and fall of absolutely everything.
</P>
<P>
   A third project, by Boym Design Studio, gives tragedy a comic
twist. Though not conspicuously computer-driven, the project
nonetheless reveals the extent to which our mediated culture is
driven by binary thinking. Titled ``Buildings of Disaster,'' the
project includes bonded-nickel miniatures of the Watergate complex,
the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island nuclear power plants, the World
Trade Center, the Unabomber's house and the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Some may recoil from the black comedy of reducing these
disasters to a collection of paperweights. But Constantin and
Lorene Boym can't be accused of tastelessness. Their souvenirs are
rendered in a deadpan style. We can see them as memorials to the
events they represent, private versions of the public artworks that
at least one of them (the Murrah building) has inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Like the news footage of the destruction of the Mostar bridge in
Bosnia and the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, they are
reminders that our Age of Extremes (as the historian Eric Hobsbawm
termed the 20th century) has left its mark more emphatically in the
destruction of buildings than in the creation of new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Each figurine represents a conflict: Republican vs. Democrat;
fundamentalist Islam vs. godless United States; industry vs.
nature; reason vs. lunacy, and so on. Each conflict involves an
assault on innocence _ office workers, scientists, farmers, the
Constitution, animal and vegetable life _ and an attack on unity,
besides.
</P>
<P>
   Each has sparked debates on issues fundamental to a modern
democracy's way of life. Are presidential campaigns worth the
divisiveness and expense? Is it too late for humanity to live in
harmony with nature or the social and technological structures we
have invented?
</P>
<P>
   The figurines are also tributes to conflict itself. Without
glorifying physical violence, they reveal the cultural value of
rupture. The Watergate figurine recalls Richard M. Nixon's attempt
to subvert the Constitution. It evokes the political divisiveness
that rippled across the country in the wake of the Watergate
break-in. And it memorializes a pivotal moment of cultural
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's covert operation laid the cornerstone of today's overt
society. It broke down the walls of privacy once considered
sacrosanct. What began as an abuse of authority provoked the use of
information-gathering by the news media to challenge authority at
every turn. The line between public and private realms remains a
focus of passionate debate.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, ``60 Minutes'' presented an interview with
Timothy J. McVeigh on death row. It revealed that McVeigh and the
Unabomber, Theodore J. Kaczynski, who had been held in the same
prison, had become acquainted. McVeigh, who sees himself as extreme
right wing and Kaczynski as extreme left, noted that these
differences turned out to be immaterial. The poles collapsed into
each other in acts of violence against the authority of regulation
and conformity, of differentiation by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The target was more conspicuous in the Oklahoma City bombing,
which ripped open the facade to reveal the egg-crate interior, a
vertical Kafka Land of uniform bureaucratic compartments.
Kaczynski's attacks were carried out at a distance from his
one-room wooden hut, but the house represented his need for
distance from the diffuse target of his rampage: the numeration of
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, phone, bank account, PIN, room, street address,
ZIP, health plan _ these coordinates of normality aptly prefigured
the fate of both terrorists, now numbered inmates, who sit out
their days in cells. Perhaps their violent acts stemmed from
mutated strains of recombinant 0s and 1s.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't the Boyms add a figurine of Cooper-Hewitt to the
collection? The triennial is an explosion: an attack on the walls
between individual design disciplines and the barriers that
separate design from everything else. Nietzsche philosophized with
a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The triennial's organizers have used the delete button to create
a credible mythology for design today: protean, expansive, filled
with deep reserves of historical meaning, an art that leaves no
area of consciousness unexplored.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Lawsuit Shows Risks for Small Firms Trying to Get Online  &HT;     By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Natasha Becker can take nuts, spices, flour and eggs and whip out a
Russian sherry teacake to die for. But ask her to combine bits and
bytes to create a Web site and she'd be lost.
<P>
   So when the San Mateo resident wanted to move her cake business,
Sweet Temptations, to the Internet, she said she paid $5,000 to a
company that promised it would set up, advertise and operate a Web
site for her business, plus teach her how to run a successful
storefront online. She said the company, Fortune Financial Systems,
never came through with anything more than two days of training.
</P>
<P>
   Now Becker, along with several other entrepreneurs who signed up
for the package, is suing Fortune Financial. Her tale illustrates a
maxim of every gold rush: Just because you bought a map doesn't
mean you'll find the mother lode.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 or so entrepreneurs who signed up for the Fortune
Financial package all have small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't much out there right now for the really small
businesses'' who need outside help to get online and get seen by
prospective customers, said Leslie Lundquist, author of ``Selling
Online for Dummies'' from IDG Books. Companies providing Web
services ``go for larger companies that have more money to spend on
this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Packages for small-business owners who want to get in on the
Internet mania are proliferating, said Pat Wallace, chief executive
of the San Francisco area Better Business Bureau. ``You see these
seminars advertised constantly in the paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of merchants who know the Internet is there,
know it's probably the future, but don't know how or what to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker fit that profile. So she attended a free seminar in May,
where Fortune Financial pitched her on the $5,000 package. After
paying up, she went to a two-day workshop in June, then spent
months calling Fortune Financial and its various subsidiaries to
find out when they would deliver the hands-on assistance. She said
she rarely got through or was brushed off.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in September, desperate to get her Web site up before
the holidays, Becker paid hundreds of dollars more to other
contractors to get online _ she's at &LR;  www.sweettemptme.com &LR;  _ and
to advertise the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many bottles of Pepto Bismol I drank
because of the stress these people put me through,'' Becker said.
``I had to refinance my home to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortune Financial, a holding company traded over the counter as
a penny stock, moved from Nevada to Florida during the months
Becker was dealing with them. Troy Sheffield, who handles investor
relations for the company, said it is being closed down and has
already shuttered the subsidiaries _ Internet Success System,
Markcomm Productions, Bizz-e and Power Communications _ that
operated its seminars and Web services business ``because of some
problems like that'' experienced by Becker.
</P>
<P>
   He referred specific questions about the lawsuit to company
investors, who said they could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn business owners to stop and check the credentials
of anyone offering courses and services before they buy. Consumers
can call the BBB in the state where the company's headquarters are
to see if complaints have been filed against it; if it's a
franchise, they can call the state franchise board. ``Really do
your homework,'' Wallace said. ``Ask for a ton of information.''
</P>
<P>
   But Becker thought Fortune Financial was a safe bet because its
brochures said it was working with Success magazine, a publication
that has been in business since 1891.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me feel extremely comfortable'' about signing up for
the package, she said. ``The big kahuna was we'd get all this
advertising, all this exposure in Success magazine. But it turned
out that while we were at the seminar, Success magazine was filing
for Chapter 11.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeking bankruptcy protection in May, Success magazine
sold its assets to a Raleigh, N.C., venture capital firm that
recently resumed publication. A spokesman said the magazine has
received 30 or 40 inquiries from people who took the seminars and
were left dangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly that the previous owners strained the
credibility of the publication by going into these kind of
alliances,'' said Ripley Hotch, the new editor in chief. ``I can't
help but regard (the seminar operators) as fly-by-night people who
make all kinds of promises and don't keep them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is: ``Work with reputable firms, do your research,''
Lundquist said. She suggested several firms, such as Verio,
VerticalNet, SmartAge and ViaWeb.com, that specialize in getting
new businesses online.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small business could even get away with using sites like
Tripod and Lycos that let you make your own personal home page,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, from the BBB, said there are warning signs to help
guard against fraudulent businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One red flag is asking for payment up front. You should pay
for something when you get it. We get complaints when people have
paid big bucks up front and got nothing _ and by then, it's too
late. The (fraudulent businesses) are out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how often companies offering seminars
or services fail to deliver what they've promised. People who
attended the Fortune Financial workshop in San Mateo said they were
told that the firm held seminars almost every weekend in locations
around the country. ``If they only did this to 1,000 people, that's
$5 million right there,'' said Ray Asper, a manufacturers
representative in San Mateo who attended the seminar with Becker
and is also suing Fortune Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to be on the Internet,'' but not everyone knows
how to actually do it, said Marie Weiner of Cotchett, Pitre &AMP;
Simon, the Burlingame law firm handling the case.

 _ SF CHRON   Book Gives Some Tips on Avoiding IRS Audits 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Is there a checklist a business can use to lessen its chances of
being audited by the IRS?
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; a  &LR; A: With four weeks to go before filing your tax returns, your
question is timely for individuals as well as businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A recent book by tax attorney Frederick Daily, ``Surviving an
IRS Tax Audit'' (Nolo.com, $24.95), discusses what attracts an IRS
examination of your tax returns and what you can do to lessen the
odds and improve the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Daily mentions these warning flags to the IRS:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Comparative size of a deduction to the rest of the return &LR; . For
example, $19,000 of mortgage interest on a return showing just
$18,000 of income or $32,000 of unreimbursed employee expense on a
return showing income of $17,500.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; An item that is out of character for the taxpayer &LR; . For example,
a plumber claiming expenses related to a business plane or a
65-year-old taxpayer claiming four minor dependent children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; An item reported in the wrong place. &LR;  For example, $2,000 of
credit card interest deducted along with business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Evidence of intent to mislead the IRS. &LR;  For example, incomplete
forms or missing information such as the ``occupation'' box left
blank.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; High gross income. &LR;  The more your income exceeds $100,000, the
likelier an audit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Self-employment. &LR;  The IRS targets those who are in business for
themselves four times more often than wage earners. That's because
the self-employed are basically on the honor system and don't
receive W-2 forms stating their income.
</P>
<P>
   Another author, Professor Amir Aczel, studied 1,200 audit cases
and discovered that self-employed people filing Schedule C are
often audited when they claim expenses of more than 63 percent of
their gross receipts but seldom audited when their deductions are
less than 52 percent of gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo's Web site (www.nolo.com) also offers tax audit tips as
part of its online answers to more than 800 frequently asked legal
questions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guaranteed way to audit-proof your filing, but Daily
and Nolo.com offer these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Prepare your tax return by computer. &LR;  A neat, computer-prepared
return looks more official to the IRS classifiers and fits the IRS
bias favoring computer processing. Most professional tax preparers
use computers, and there are some good PC and Macintosh programs
such as Intuit's TurboTax and MacInTax that you can use to prepare
your own return.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; If you can't use a computer, print carefully. &LR;  A messy return
_ cross-outs, sloppy handwriting, smudges _ suggests you are
careless and disorganized and almost begs to be audited.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Don't use round numbers for deductions. &LR;  For example, $1,000 or
$12,000 instead of $978 or $12,127. It's an indication that you are
estimating things rather than keeping good records.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Back up your expenses.  &LR; If you claim large deductions for unusual
items, such as an earthquake or fire loss, attach documentary proof
to the back of your tax return. Copies of repair receipts, canceled
checks, insurance reports and pictures are advisable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Avoid filing an income tax return with a Schedule C, Profit
or &LR;  &UR; Loss for Business, that reports a net loss from a
small-business &LR; 
 &UR; venture. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Report side-job income as other income on line 22 of your
tax &LR;  &UR; return. &LR;  Try this only if the income is relatively small and
you are not claiming any business deductions against it.
Technically, side-job income is usually reported on Schedule C,
Profit or Loss from Business. But filing a Schedule C undoubtedly
increases your audit chances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ &UR; Don't use electronic filing or the IRS preprinted address &LR;  &UR; label
on your tax return.  &LR; These enable the IRS to get your return into
the processing cycle, including the audit cycle, more quickly.
However, using electronic filing or the label usually means that
any refund will come faster. If you expect a refund but fear an
audit, you'll have to weigh the pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
More Audit Advice
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: If you are audited by the IRS, what are the odds of getting
through without paying any additional taxes?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Nolo.com reports the odds are poor and getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 15 percent of audit victims pay nothing (other than
their personal legal and accounting expenses). Thanks to its
sophisticated computer selection process, the IRS is more likely
than ever to win cash from its targets. The agency audits about as
many taxpayers as 10 or 15 years ago, but it is recovering four
times as much money.
</P>
<P>
   If you are audited, there are ways to limit the damage. For
starters, Daily suggests seeking a delay in filing your 1999 return
because the IRS might otherwise immediately expand its audit to
include your latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of filing, you can get IRS Form 4868 and return it by
April 15 to obtain an automatic extension to file by August 15. If
the audit is still going on in August, request a second extension
on IRS Form 2688 and file it by August 15. If the second extension
is granted, you will have until October 15 to file your return. If
the audit is still alive on October 15, Daily says consider not
filing your return until the audit is completed.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you have paid all the taxes due and have no
fraudulent intent, you won't incur any penalties or interest for
not meeting the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO TAXES: &QL; 
In a recent story on San Francisco's ``transient merchants'' tax, I
mentioned taxes that local businesses pay to the city. Locally
licensed businesses pay a tax of either 1.5 percent of payroll
expenses or $1.23 to $3 for every $1,000 of gross receipts,
whichever is higher.
</P>
<P>
   However, city Treasurer Susan Leal tells us that only 1 out of 9
of the city's approximately 70,000 businesses pays either of these
taxes. Small businesses can file for an exemption if their payroll
or gross receipts tax liability is less than $2,500.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commercial and utilitarian objects feel perfectly at home in art
these days, whether copied, adapted or merely taken over: Jeff
Koons's basketballs, Robert Gober's sinks, Mike Kelly's stuffed
toys. On their own, however, outside the ennobling frame of a
gallery or the design wing of a museum, no one would mistake them
for works of art.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't need a PhD to recognize metaphorical speech if
someone remarked about a basketball, ``Now (italics)that's(end
italics) a work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current environment, which defines art as almost
anything, museums and galleries also display commercial arts like
advertising, illustrations and cartoons, raising their social
status, too. For a long while such wage labor was not considered
proper company for saints and prophets like Monet and Picasso, who
dared starvation to realize their visions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet photography, which was itself excluded from the company of
art for years, is such a porous medium that commercial work crossed
the boundaries even in the early years. The photographer's
intentions can be so fully concealed by the images themselves that
certain images quickly broke through lines thought to be hard and
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The interplay of aesthetic and commercial concerns in the 19th
century is vividly set forth in ``Image and Enterprise: The
Photographs of Adolphe Braun,'' at the Rhode Island School of
Design in Providence through April 22 and at the Cleveland Museum
of Art from June 18 through Aug. 27. The first American show to
examine Braun's career, it features 100 of his photographs, along
with related material.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Maureen C. O'Brien, the curator of painting and
sculpture at the school's museum, and Mary Bergstein, associate
professor of art and architectural history at the school, the show
opens a large window on work that is not well known.
</P>
<P>
   Braun's photographs are sometimes stunning and sometimes more
technically than aesthetically accomplished. The exemplary catalog
places his achievements and his career within various historical
contexts, including 19th-century industrial design and painting,
the rise of art reproductions, and the commercialization of
photography in France in response to technological and social
change. It is good to be reminded of the many forces impinging on
photography, not the least of them the photographer's need to earn
a living.
</P>
<P>
   Braun (1812-1877) was a highly successful textile designer who
lived most of his life in Mulhouse, an industrial center in Alsace
specializing in the printing of luxury fabrics and wallpaper. In
1842 he published his own lithographs of flowers as design models
for decorative arts. Taking up photography seriously only in 1851,
he presented an album of 300 flower photographs in Paris three
years later; it is these for which he is principally known today.
</P>
<P>
   Large and positively luscious, in succulent shades of brown with
perfectly plain backgrounds and no visible supports or containers,
these are not conventional still lifes or vanitas pictures but
simply flowers in all their creamy fullness, rather casually
arranged, with random linear stems and intricate meshes of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century painters (who may have been influenced by
Braun's flower photographs) have made this kind of picture
familiar, so it comes as a surprise to discover that he did not
mean to make art but to make models for textile, wallpaper and
porcelain designers. His unwilting blossoms were more likely to end
up as patterns on the chaise longue than framed on the wall above
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was anticipated from the beginning that photography would be
of service to the arts, including the industrial arts. Braun
himself made the first textile designs in history based on
photographs, and the show displays fabrics printed with floral
designs derived from photographic examples.
</P>
<P>
   The mastery of his camera work, however, soon reaped accolades
usually reserved for art, and Braun quickly acquired a reputation
as one of the leading photographers of his day. Though he did not
remain at this summit, he did sustain a successful commercial
career, adjusting his subject matter to the prevailing trade winds.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the subjects of art, from gods to duchesses, nudes
to sailing ships, have been largely determined by patrons and
markets. Photography could no more afford to be an exception than
any other medium. Braun went on to photograph landscape
extensively, most notably views at dizzy heights in the Alps. The
growth of railroad travel and increased leisure time had whetted
the public's appetite for travel images, even for those who
traveled only from their armchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional Alpine views, like a profile of the Staubbach
waterfall plunging off a cliff in a stream so transparent another
cliff is visible through the water, are as romantic and glorious as
anyone could wish. (A couple of these pictures strongly prefigure
the work of Ansel Adams, who probably did not know them.)
</P>
<P>
   Other landscapes and pictures of Alsatian monuments are quite
well done but seldom exceptional. If the market dictated the
subject, the photographer's skill still dictated the results.
Nadar, after all, was a commercial portraitist, and Atget
advertised ``documents for artists,'' but no one now doubts their
creative powers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Format and technique also took their cues from the market, as
well as from new technologies. Braun branched out into stereographs
when they became fashionable, and perfected landscape panoramas
once he sensed there was an audience for them. His panoramas are
unusually clear, the details and textures rendered with perfect
fidelity, but what sometimes raises them to the rarefied level of
gorgeous is his adoption, in 1866, and unsurpassed mastery of the
carbon transfer process.
</P>
<P>
   This was a printing technique that used permanent dyes or inks,
eliminating a tendency to fade that made some purchasers hesitant.
Carbon prints could be produced in different shades as well,
widening their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Braun photographed the regional costumes of the various Swiss
cantons and a few images of farm animals as travel mementos or
references for artists. He also took pictures of the devastation of
the Franco-Prussian war, which cost the French Alsace and Lorraine.
The humiliated French made icons of his allegorical portraits of
two women personifying the lost regions; these were even reproduced
on plates, one of which is in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs on china (and other materials) were common mementos
in the 19th century and more common today; think of the millions of
souvenir plates and cups with happy pictures of Prince Charles and
Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   When Braun tried to turn himself into an artist, as he did
admirably in eight unusually large carbon prints of hunting
trophies, he succeeded artistically but evidently failed
commercially. The photographs of trophies, images of dead game and
hunting accouterments in the vein of 17th-century still-life
paintings, are virtual tours de force of clarity, composition and
tone. They were as large (32 by 24 inches) and just about as
expensive as small paintings and were marketed as dining room
decorations. Apparently, though, they could not compete with
full-color paintings.
</P>
<P>
   He forged a more successful connection to art, and rendered it a
true service, with reproductions of works in museums. In 1867, when
he first published photographs of master drawings, most of the
leading drawing collections were unknown to all but a few scholars,
and the art treasures of the world were still seen chiefly in
engraved reproductions. The carbon process could give the
appearance of red chalk or of graphite on blue-tinted paper; the
photographs look astonishingly like original drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog reports that they made reproductive engravings
obsolete, and that because they revealed mistakes and changes
nearly invisible in faded drawings they were considered better
records of the artist's intention than the originals. Voila!
Photography outdoes art on its own turf.
</P>
<P>
   Braun also photographed sculptures and paintings at about the
time the brothers Alinari were doing so in Italy, and the two
bodies of work became the standard references in museums, libraries
and art schools (not to mention personal travel albums) for close
to a hundred years. They helped establish the discipline of art
history and the foundations of Andre Malraux's ``museum without
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Art reproductions answered the call of many industrialized
nations to introduce masses of people to art as a means of raising
the level of taste. In 1869, Braun's son and others had taken
pictures of the Sistine ceiling in which that distant and dimly
lighted masterpiece was introduced to the world at large for
virtually the first time; they even revealed some features that had
been invisible before.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Braun's photographs were available to students at the
Rhode Island School of Design when it opened in 1878, and they are
still in the picture files today.
</P>
<P>
   The studio continued under Braun's name for years after he died,
but in his lifetime it had already become so highly organized a
commercial venture that many of his pictures were probably taken by
others. Like Mathew Brady, Braun employed a number of photographers
whom he oversaw but who went out into the field without him and
took photographs that were published under his well-known name.
</P>
<P>
   This practice, a kind of industrialized division of labor, was
one step on a path from Raphael and Rubens, who let assistants do
parts of their paintings, to Warhol, who phoned in instructions for
a painting he would sign.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when technology was making both images and information
available on a scale never seen before, the medium was rapidly
commercialized and organized, much as the Internet has expanded
from science to retail in a few short years. Money talks, and
neither art nor information services would be so rude as not to
listen.

<P>
   For all the 1980s throwbacks who had Indiana, Nevada-Las Vegas,
Kentucky and Louisville as their Final Four selections, another
opportunity for office-pool glory is online.
</P>
<P>
   For another week, Sandbox.com has continued its partnership with
CNNSI.com and Rivals.com to launch a contest for all those who
bombed in their original bracket entries. Before the tournament,
Sandbox.com introduced a contest for a $10 million first prize to
anyone who picked all 63 NCAA men's tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   The new points-based contest offers prizes to the top 10
entrants who can select winners of the remaining 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's universal; everyone bombed,'' said Amy Sasser,
spokeswoman for CNNSI.com. ``My brackets are blown, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for tips can try ESPN.com, which has culled the
findings of the more than 590,000 who entered its NCAA Men's
Tournament Challenge. According to entrants in the largest online
contest, Michigan State has a 33 percent chance of winning the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Segreti, a weather forecaster stationed at Vance Air
Force Base in Enid, Okla., who won last year's ESPN.com contest
after predicting winners of 46 of the 63 games, won't be so lucky
this year. Segreti picked Temple to defeat Iowa State in the title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Segreti, he can now try the Sandbox.com contest.

   _ TRY A NOTARY INSTEAD: About a month ago, RealLegends.com had
an interesting idea: authenticate online memorabilia with a
DNA-based identification system. According to a news release from
the Vista, Calif., company, the system employs ``fingerprint
matching and imaging, DNA extractions, unique binary data and
signature data.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how this DNA system _ especially DNA extractions _ would
have worked isn't clear, but Bruce Regis, the company's chief
executive officer, said the concept was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it was a little bit hard to get sports celebrities to
agree to fingerprint their items,'' Regis said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company plans to do authenticate its memorabilia a more
practical way _ by using a notary and a camera. Regis said the Los
Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant has agreed to be the first sports
figure to use the RealLegends.com process of authenticity.

implosion on its WindowsMedia.com site
(www.windowsmedia.com/preview/kingdome). It's even available in
3-D, but it's probably too late to order the $30 enhanced-viewing

Online viewers can get an inside glimpse of the Dome collapsing
with a remote camera that will probably get smashed during the

EDITORIAL: SETBACK ON SMOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 22:
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling that the Food and Drug
Administration has no authority to regulate tobacco will
unquestionably stagger the administration's drive to halt the
spread of nicotine addiction among young people. But it must not be
allowed to end the nation's efforts to curb the leading cause of
preventable death in the United States. Instead the court decision
throws the burden back to Congress, where meaningful legislation to
control tobacco use has been thwarted for years by the powerful
tobacco lobby acting through legislators addicted to its campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decided the issue by a narrow, 5-to-4 vote
based on contrary readings of what authority had been granted to
the FDA by Congress. The majority opinion, written by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by the court's most conservative
members, held that Congress had ``clearly precluded'' the FDA from
asserting jurisdiction over tobacco products. Congress did so, the
majority concluded, by rejecting bills over the years that would
have granted such jurisdiction and by instead enacting its own
separate legislation dealing with tobacco and health. At the same
time, the majority noted, the FDA until a few years ago had
consistently said it lacked the authority to regulate tobacco, and
its governing statute does not seem to fit the case of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The minority opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer and
joined by the court's more liberal members, argued more
convincingly, in our opinion, that recent evidence pried from
tobacco company files brought tobacco products squarely within the
literal definition of drugs and devices that the agency can
regulate. The evidence showed that the companies clearly
``intended'' their cigarettes to deliver nicotine in doses that
would ``affect'' the body, a proposition that had been difficult to
prove before. That is one reason the FDA moved to regulate the
products in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   This disappointing decision is best read as a rejection of
expansive regulation rather than a repudiation of the anti-tobacco
drive. Indeed, O'Connor wrote that the FDA ``has amply demonstrated
that tobacco use, particularly among children and adolescents,
poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public health
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's setback at the Supreme Court makes it all the more
imperative that Congress rein in an industry whose products kill
more than 400,000 Americans each year. Congress could do so either
by granting the FDA the powers it needs to regulate tobacco
products, the approach that seems most promising, or by passing
strong separate legislation of its own. This is an issue that
deserves a high profile in the fall election campaigns, right
beside the campaign finance reform that is desperately needed to
break the chokehold of special interests like the tobacco lobby.  &QL;

TRANSCRIPT OF FED PANEL ON INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel,
after its decision Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its
target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 6 percent.
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis
point increase in the discount rate to 5{ percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economic conditions and considerations addressed by the
committee are essentially the same as when the committee met in
February. The committee remains concerned that increases in demand
will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability
and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently
available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly
toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures
in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board
approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the
Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and
San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository
institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from
their district Federal Reserve Banks. &QL;

   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   NETHERLANDS: 3 APOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   The government apologized to Jews, Gypsies and Indonesians for a
``chilly'' official response in the past to their claims to
property seized during and after World War II. Prime Minister Wim
Kok said the government had to face up to ``mistakes and
shortcomings'' made in the 1940s and offered $180 million, in
addition to past restitutions, to the Central Jewish Congress.
Gypsies received an extra $13 million. Indonesians who sided with
the Dutch during Indonesia's fight for independence in 1949 were
offered $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: BERTELSMANN JOINS FUND
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, the German media company that owns Random House,
said it would contribute to a $5 billion fund to compensate
Nazi-era slave and forced laborers, but declined to say how much.
The company is in the process of revising its corporate history in
the light of evidence that it did not, as it previously contended,
oppose Hitler's regime. Contentious talks on how the fund should be
divided will resume Wednesday. .
</P>
<P>
   NETHERLANDS: CROAT HANDED OVER
</P>
<P>
   A Bosnian Croat accused of war crimes was handed over to the
United Nations tribunal in The Hague, where he arrived with a
psychiatrist and other medical personnel. Mladen Naletelic, 54, a
former military commander, was indicted for persecution, torture
and murder of Muslims in Bosnia in 1993 and 1994. The new Croatian
leadership, in contrast to past governments, accepted tribunal
doctors' findings that he was well enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   IRELAND: ORANGEMEN IN DUBLIN
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's Orange Order, whose summer parades of men in
bowler hats and orange sashes regularly plunge the province into
turmoil, has been invited by Dublin officials to march there in
May. ``We have the right of free assembly here,'' Lord Mayor Mary
Freehill said. A Sinn Fein spokesman compared Freehill's action to
``the state governor inviting the Ku Klux Klan to march in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   CHILE: PINOCHET IN HOSPITAL
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 84, entered a clinic for tests after
fainting in his residence outside Santiago. The clinic would not
comment on the condition of the former dictator, who returned to
Chile on March 3 after spending 16 months under house arrest
outside London on a Spanish warrant charging him with human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN: EX-AIDE ADMITS HARASSMENT
</P>
<P>
   The former governor of Osaka, Japan's second-largest city,
admitted for the first time in court that he had groped a
21-year-old campaign worker last year. Until now, Isamu Yamada, a
former comedian who still uses his stage name, Knock Yokoyama, had
denied accusations of sexual harassment while agreeing to pay a
large civil settlement. Yokoyama resigned after his indictment for
sexual molestation.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: ALBRIGHT REBUKED
</P>
<P>
   In its latest response to Washington's decision to ease economic
sanctions, the Foreign Ministry rebuked Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright and other officials for a ``lack of honesty''
and ``ignorance of the geography of the region.'' The statement
appeared aimed less at the moves announced by Albright than at
remarks she made later in India that made note of divisions over
policy toward the United States between Iran's democratic reform
movement and a hard-line faction associated with the ruling
clerics.

ANGELS' RACE FOR SECOND BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The Anaheim Angels starting job at second base
has been narrowed down to a competition between Scott Spiezio and
Trent Durrington, with Pat Kelly holding an outside chance.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio is a more-established hitter and has power. Durrington
has more defensive range and is faster. Kelly probably has a better
blend of all talents but has been slowed by a sore shoulder and
hasn't been able to play much.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had two hits in Tuesday's 12-3 loss to the Chicago White
Sox at Tucson Electric Park, but he also couldn't get anything on a
couple of throws that resulted in infield singles. He'll get an
opportunity to show manager Mike Scioscia what he can do in the
final week of Cactus League play but needs to show he's healthy
more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them gives us a little different package,''
Scioscia said. ``Durrington is an exciting player with a lot of
range, but he's still developing, especially offensively. Spiezio
is much further along offensively and he has power. He doesn't have
as much range as Durrington, but he has sure hands. And both turn
the double play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive back: You'll have to excuse Tim Salmon for being a
little sensitive when it came to talking about his sore back.
Salmon, after all, has been slowed by injuries the past two years
and doesn't want to dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   He was limited to a DH role nearly all of 1998 because of a torn
ligament in the arch of his foot. And last season, he played in
only 98 games because of a badly sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   So the simple question, ``How's your back?'' elicits an
understandable response: ``I'm not going to talk to you guys about
my back. I don't want to make it turn into a big deal. I've had it
before. Sometimes, you take too many swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon likes to get as much work during spring training as
possible because it helps him get off to a fast start once the
season begins. Wednesday he missed his third game in a row because
of his back, but he took batting practice in the indoor batting
cage Tuesday and is expected to return to the lineup today against
the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   He's having a good spring, hitting .464 (13 for 28) with four
homers and 11 RBI in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Bafflingly bad: Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis gave up nine runs and
11 hits in 4 innings Tuesday but was ``baffled'' by his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ahead of every hitter,'' Schoeneweis said. ``I hit my
spot every time except the last pitch (a home run by Chris
Singleton). That was my only mistake as far as I'm concerned. I
threw my pitches where I wanted to. They hit the ball on the ground
almost every time. That's what I'm supposed to do as a sinker-ball
pitcher. I just ran out of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great sinker,'' Scioscia said. ``Those ground balls
turned into seeing-eye hits. The results obviously weren't what we
wanted, but you have to look at the number of quality pitches he
threw.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his spring ERA rose from 2.25 to 6.48, Schoeneweis
is on track to win a spot in the starting rotation. But he couldn't
help but wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I have the luxury of giving up nine runs in a
game,'' he said. ``I'm not Ken Hill, I don't have a lot of years in
the game. But I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he rebound?: Today is a big day for Todd Greene. Greene
caught five innings of Tuesday's game, but if he is going to make
the squad as a third catcher, he needs to be able to bounce back
and be ready to play again today. Greene, who has had two surgeries
on his right shoulder, hasn't been able to catch back-to-back days
yet this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to help us he needs to be able to catch on a regular
basis,'' Scioscia said. ``It can't be a situation where he needs
two or three days after after he catches. You always like to have a
bat like his off the bench, but I don't know if we can afford to do
it.''

INTERNET MILLIONAIRES BUY BOWLING TOUR, FOLLOWING LATEST TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   and LENA WILLIAMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro bowlers have long been the Everymen of the nation's lanes,
blue-collar practitioners of a low-tech sport.
</P>
<P>
   But a very high-tech thing happened Tuesday: three entrepreneurs
with software and Internet pedigrees announced a deal to invest $5
million to prepare the Professional Bowlers Association for a
future in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing made too much sense,'' said Chris Peters, a former
vice president of Microsoft and a devout bowler. ``We see it as a
diamond in the rough, a turnaround opportunity people were missing.
We were so excited we hoped nobody else would figure it out. We had
to get this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters and his partners _ Mike Slade, the former president of
Starwave, the creator of elaborate Web sites, and Rob Glaser, the
chairman of RealNetworks, which makes software to send audio and
video on the Internet _ plan to revive the PBA Tour's moribund
marketing and public relations, and zip up its television
production with the expectation of Webcasting the tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tech play is combining the TV and the Internet,'' Peters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of buying the nonprofit PBA from its 2,800 members _
including paying off about $2 million in debts and raising annual
prize money by $1 million to $5 million _ is cheap. Investing $15
million or $20 million more for the long term is a fortune for the
PBA but pennies compared with the $175 million paid last week by
the YankeeNets to buy the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   But the eager involvement of three high-tech wizards
demonstrates an evolution in sports ownership. The beer barons,
shipbuilders and bankers who who owned franchises are giving way to
a new breed with huge caches of new money. Glaser, whose
RealNetworks stock is worth $954 million, built a two-lane bowling
alley in the basement of his company's Seattle headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, a billionaire through Broadcast.com, spent $280
million to buy the doormat Dallas Mavericks. Ted Leonsis, a top
America Online executive, and a group of partners spent $200
million to buy the Washington Capitals and stakes in the Washington
Capitals and the MCI Center. He lured Michael Jordan to buy a
piece, then placed him in charge of the Wizards' operations.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, Patrick McEnroe, the retired tennis player with a
somewhat famous brother, John, was awarded the ninth World Team
Tennis franchise, one that will play in East Quogue, as the New
York Hamptons. When the WTT last had a team in New York, the
Apples, McEnroe, 34, was a 12-year-old junior player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing something in New York is pretty expensive,'' said
McEnroe, a commentator for CBS Sports, ESPN and ``Imus in the
Morning'' on WFAN radio. ``My initial thought was the Hamptons and
the East End of Long Island. It's a good tennis community. People
are interested in tennis there.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost is hardly prohibitive: the franchise fee is $60,000,
and the typical costs of running a WTT team range from $300,000 to
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The WTT features two-man, two-women teams, with a coach. Each
match consists of five sets, with one set each of men's singles,
women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who was raised in Douglaston, Queens, inquired about
buying a team a year ago, said Billie Jean King, the league's
founder, who hopes to expand to 16 teams and add more
player-owners. ``We've been waiting for the right owners,'' she
said. ``When Patrick called, we felt we were on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBA's new owners hope they have the right strategy to return
the tour to the higher-profile days of the 1960's and 70's, when
ABC Sports carried more than 20 tournaments a year and the
announcers Chris Schenkel and Billy Welu were as renowned as the
stars Don Carter, Dick Weber and Carmen Salvino.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stars are Parker Bohn III, Chris Barnes and Walter Ray
Williams Jr.
</P>
<P>
   All PBA Tour events are seen on cable, either on ESPN or Fox
Sports Net. The ABC deal ended in 1997 after 36 years, and a
two-year foray in which the PBA paid CBS to be televised ended with
stiff losses for the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they still get a 1 rating as a cable sports product, with
no investment at all,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the ability to capitalize on passion for bowling
among millions of everyday participants will be enhanced by
ownership of the entire sport _ with no unions, no rival owners
with separate agendas and no impediments to innovation. The buyers
took control of the national, senior and regional tours, as well as
the logos, copyrights and Web site, which gets 500,000 visits a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the level of control,'' he said. ``It's
the ability to make decisions very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gerberich, the PBA commissioner, who will retain his job
but share power with a new chief executive officer, said: ``We have
three of the smartest Internet guys in the world. Hopefully, people
think it will legitimize the sport and we can be more competitive
again.''

LAVIN'S SKIN TOUGH, ATTITUDE TOUGHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Winning is a matter of life and death at
UCLA. Any illusions to the contrary that Steve Lavin harbored were
shattered one day last month when he received an e-mail threatening
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wrote it made it graphically clear that if the UCLA
basketball team's NCAA Tournament appearance streak was going to
expire this year at 11, then Lavin deserved to perish, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 miles to the north, Lavin's father Cap received the
same death threat, presumably for the offense of having sired his
sixth child.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the rage that must be percolating in a person for whom
any number of losing scores could trigger such a response. Clearly,
it is somebody from the same species of boorishness as the man who
got so irate over his car bumper being tapped he bounce-passed a
dog into a lane of oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Police thus far have had little success tracing the threat to
its source. So for the past few weeks, Lavin has been living with
the knowledge that the person who wishes him dead could have been
sitting in a row behind the home bench during UCLA's final four
home games of the regular season. Or waiting to shake Lavin's hand
after one of the Bruins' first two NCAA Tournament games in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The person could be holding a ticket to UCLA's Midwest Regional
semifinal game against Iowa State on Thursday at The Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin figured he could respond in one of two ways. He could
whistle through the graveyard or make wisecracks for however much
longer this topsy-turvy season lasted. The Bruins' beleaguered
fourth-year coach chose quips to keep from quivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the kids (on the team), when Gene Bartow was the coach
at UCLA, somebody wanted to shoot his dog. So at least they've got
the right target this time,'' Lavin said the other day, as sanguine
as you please.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it troubled him that his father was targeted, though,
frankly, Lavin wouldn't have been surprised if his dad, a retired
English teacher, had spruced up the syntax and returned the message
to its sender along with a poem or a book suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   When they first spoke of the death threat, Lavin, 35, told his
father, ``I guess whoever sent it thought the apple didn't fall far
enough from the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the son inherited his sense of humor from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't focus on it,'' Cap Lavin said of the threat,
dismissing it with the wave of his hand. ``I responded to it with a
sense of irony.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures that Lavin would turn to his father for answers and
not just because the elder Lavin starred at the University of San
Francisco under Pete Newell. Who better than a lover of literature
to make sense of a UCLA team that has been harder to read than
Henry James?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, in Year 1 AD (After Baron Davis, their superlative
point guard), started the regular season 8-2, finished 6-0 and went
5-9 in between. The nadir had to be the third week in February,
otherwise known as Desert Scorn. UCLA hit the road to play the
Arizona schools and lost both games by a combined 44 points.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time some people inside Lavin's ever-broadening
social circle expressed concern that he had lost his center. They
worried that the rollover contract Lavin had received last summer
had made him very secure but also somewhat complacent.
</P>
<P>
   One friend joked about confronting him and conducting a
tough-love intervention, the way you would with loved ones who are
alcoholics or drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's addiction? Some will tell you it's the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A few friends who have known him since before he became a UCLA
assistant coach to Jim Harrick in 1991 were worried earlier in the
winter that Lavin's life had become as flashy as the Bruins'
offense and was exhibiting as little substance, too.
</P>
<P>
   This was around the time that UCLA, under junior point guard
Earl Watson's direction, was gunning for quick points off the fast
break and acting acutely allergic to any play run out of a
half-court offense. The Bruins were becoming all too predictable,
but that wasn't the worst of it. In the losses at ASU and Arizona,
the Bruins had empty soda cans for hearts.
</P>
<P>
   After getting blown out at ASU, three UCLA players spent the
time set aside for shooting free throws at practice the next day
goofing around on nearby gymnastics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the discipline? The desire? If that wasn't Lavin's
most damning moment, it came the next day when the Bruins looked
lethargic in a 15-point loss at Arizona that dropped them to
seventh place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The death threat followed soon thereafter. Lavin had every
reason to be grim, to be glum, to come to practice every day and
castigate his players to make himself feel better. He could have
gotten physical like Indiana's Bob Knight or vulgar like Maryland's
Gary Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lavin got metaphysical like Tony Robbins. He kept
telling his players they were this close to realizing their
``monster potential.'' Six losses in seven games hadn't shaken his
faith in them. That was the thing that finally got the players'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting raked over the coals and yet he came to the gym
every day and was positive,'' said senior forward Sean Farnham.
``After a while, you start thinking, `If this man can believe in us
at our lowest point that we can accomplish anything we set out to
do, why don't we have a little more faith in each other?'''
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the Bruins started making the extra passes.
They bought into the idea of a half-court offense and renewed their
commitment to defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin made some adjustments, too. He started running practices
with more of an iron fist. The kid gloves came off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took more control of practices,'' Farnham said. ``He made
sure we were doing everything precisely right. It had to be done
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's overall improvement since then has been dramatic.
During their eight-game winning streak, the Bruins have shot 49.6
percent from the field and 42.6 percent from 3-point range while
holding their opponents to 40.4 percent shooting. Contrast that
with their first 24 games when they shot 47.5 percent from the
field, 34.9 percent from beyond the arc and held their opponents to
43.2 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A little more attention to detail, the return of JaRon Rush and
all of the sudden Lavin is being painted with bright, broad strokes
again. You can continue to believe, as we do, that a veteran
assistant would make Lavin look even better. But it'd be ungracious
to nitpick about a coach who has led his team to three Sweet
Sixteen appearances in four seasons. Let's face it: If his name
were Henry Bibby, he'd own L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin gives the impression he's made of Teflon. But he is not.
The bad times have left an impression. There's some residue there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the same person for four years,'' Lavin said. ``The
perception of who I am keeps changing based on wins and losses. I
haven't changed. Not really. The time, thought, energy and emotion
I bring to coaching the kids is the same. The only difference is,
I'm a little more weathered, a little more beaten up. I have a
little thicker skin. I'm a little less wide-eyed and bushy-tailed.
I have a better understanding of what the profession is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, of course. Lavin now knows you sometimes can't win for
winning.

 &HT;    Groom humor: Rockwell turns the joke on himself
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Admit it, it was fun laughing at him.
</P>
<P>
   But last night at a Sandy Springs comedy club, the man who
became the butt of a nationally televised joke called ``Who Wants
to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' proved he could get also get people
to laugh with him.
</P>
<P>
   Since his doomed February nuptials to Darva Conger on the Fox
network, Rick Rockwell has embarked on a multi-city ``Annulment
Tour'' in hopes of invigorating his stand-up comedy career, and
retooling his image as a publicity-seeking fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the show aired to an audience estimated at 22 million
viewers, published reports revealed that a former girlfriend had
once filed a restraining order against him, that his real name is
Rick Balkey, and that he apparently padded his bank account to get
on the show in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But after one of the worst one-night stands in recorded history,
Rockwell's one-night stand in Atlanta demonstrated that he has far
more skill as a comic than he ever showed as a husband.
</P>
<P>
   His hourlong set was filled with sexual humor, observational
riffs, sight gags and spot-on Ross Perot imitations that kept the
audience of about 250 people laughing and hooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people get shut out of their honeymoon?'' Rockwell
said, opening his hourlong set with some self-deprecating jibes.
``Now how many of you came home to 100 news trucks waiting to tell
the world you didn't (have sex) on your honeymoon?''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared, and Rockwell whose toothy smile makes him
look like a baby shark, knew he was on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the crowd got restless, which it did several times,
Rockwell returned to the scene of the slime.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to three women who showed up in bridal gowns sitting in
the audience, Rockwell turned to them and said: ``That's a real
nightmare for me, three Darvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times he purposely mangled Conger's name from Darva to
larvae, like the insect. And although they haven't spoken since
Conger filed for an annulment just 36 hours after their televised
marriage, it's clear that Rockwell has been following her career
closely. Maybe too closely.
</P>
<P>
   Remarking on published reports that Conger was going to pose
nude in a men's magazine after losing her job, Rockwell cracked:
``I hope she does. I'd like too see her naked at least once before
we get this thing dissolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a pre-show interview, it was Rockwell who seemed exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Californian portrayed himself as a sad clown who
was crying on the inside while laughing all the way to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional cork right now,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It's all been so unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there was any difference between marrying a
complete stranger who only wants him for his bank roll, Rockwell
said: ``When you hire a prostitute, you don't build a walk-in
closet for them in your house like I did for Darva.''

EFFORT TO CRACK DOWN ON FELONS WHO ILLEGALLY POSSESS FIREARMS IS
DECLARED A SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Law enforcement authorities and state
officials on Tuesday declared Project Felon a success, pointing to
46 federal weapons indictments and 19 guilty pleas in western
Missouri in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan also offered new state resources to
help federal prosecutors continue its crackdown on felons who
illegally possess firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing violent crime deserves all the resources we can bring
to bear,'' Carnahan said on a visit to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Under Project Felon, which was announced in early October,
convicted felons who are caught with weapons are charged under
federal gun laws, which generally carry longer sentences than
similar charges in state or local courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Highway Patrol soon will assign two troopers to
work full-time on the program, Carnahan said. The governor also is
directing the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole to review the
status of state offenders charged under the federal program.
</P>
<P>
   If those offenders were under state supervision, their parole
could be revoked and they could be returned to state prison after
serving their federal sentences, Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   State corrections and parole officers also will be encouraged to
strongly remind felons that they could face harsh federal sentences
if they are arrested with a gun after their release from state
prison.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill said he appreciated the
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Project Felon is ``working very well because we in law
enforcement are working well together,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 percent of federal felonies charged in Kansas City
since the program was announced are related to Project Felon, court
records show. That level of commitment is paying off, said J.
Robert Switzer, special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have saved lives, we are saving lives and we will continue
to save lives,'' Switzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Two cases in particular show the value of the program, Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Kaplin Pulce, who was convicted for stealing, was
arrested Oct. 30 at a downtown haunted house when a 9 mm handgun
fell from his pocket as he was headed down a slide.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, authorities arrested John E. Francis on weapons
charges after a domestic disturbance. In 1975, Francis was
convicted of first-degree murder for killing Kansas City Police
Officer Russell D. Mestdagh after a pharmacy robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the first defendant to be sentenced as part
of the program, Theron L. Davis, received a term of seven years and
three months in prison for carrying a loaded revolver after felony
drug and burglary convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon a federal jury in Kansas City convicted
Odies Cole Jr. on a Project Felons weapons charge.

HARGROVE TAKES ON FLIGHTY ORIOLES

<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ A five-time division-winning manager
meets a two-time payroll loser. It is not exactly the irresistible
force meeting the immovable object, but developments require
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Will Mike Hargrove conquer the highest-paid underachievers in
the history of the game, or will the Baltimore Orioles and the man
who pays them chew up and spit out yet another manager?
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove is the fifth manager the Orioles have employed during
the six-and-a-half-year ownership of Peter Angelos. They won a
division championship under Davey Johnson in 1997, but he was still
replaced by Ray Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons of folly followed. With payrolls totaling $146
million, the Orioles compiled a 157-167 record, finishing in fourth
place both seasons, ahead of only an expansion team in its first
two years, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. For only $8 million more, the
Yankees won two World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Hargrove available to assume command of this
dysfunctional outfit? Had he not managed the Cleveland Indians to
five consecutive division championships, three American League
Championship Series and two World Series appearances? Yes, but the
Yankees, and not the Indians, have won three World Series in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last October John Hart, the Indians' general manager, dispatched
Hargrove and named Charlie Manuel, the team's batting coach and
Hart's long-time friend, as the new manager. Hart said the team
needed a new voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understand when they say something like that,'' Sandy
Alomar Jr., the Indians' catcher, said. ``They're pretty similar
guys. Mike was great with the players. I have no idea what they
mean. Maybe they mean they needed someone different in charge. When
you say a new voice, it doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart and Hargrove had long been portrayed in baseball circles as
two men co-existing, but not always happily. A person close to the
Indians said that Hart had wanted to fire Hargrove a few years ago,
but was stopped by the then owner, Richard Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt it was time for a change,'' Hargrove said at
the Orioles spring-training camp here. ``John and I got along. We
didn't hang out together and go places together. We'd go out to
dinner occasionally. But we got along. We disagreed on some things,
but I felt then and think now it was healthy disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove had hardly recovered from the shock of dismissal when
the Orioles offered him their manager's job. A man on the rebound
finds it hard to say no, especially when the suitor spends money as
liberally as Angelos does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here,'' Hargrove said, ``I found things weren't as bad
or as chaotic as what I'd heard. There are good people throughout
the organization. The players have a tremendous work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   They have large salaries as well and that underachieving
reputation. ``I think the beauty of baseball is that every spring
last year's slate is wiped clean and you've got to make your own
imprint on the slate,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' 1999 slate became muddied early. They lost 12 of
their first 15 games and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of built-in alibis last year and some guys
took advantage of them,'' B.J. Surhoff, the team's good-hitting
left fielder, said. ``There were a lot of distractions early on.
The Cuban game was a big distraction. All the talk about Ray's
status was a distraction to a lot of people. You didn't know what
was going to happen with him early on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles played two exhibition games against the Cuban team,
one in Havana late in spring training, the other in Baltimore early
in the season. The games became a distraction because the players,
for the most part, did not want to play the games, and their effort
reflected their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, sitting in the opposing dugout, saw a different reason
for the Orioles' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a team that had a tendency to play really well for three
or four innings and all of a sudden for a couple innings just
completely lose their focus,'' Hargrove said. ``They'd re-gather
their focus and go on, but in that two- or three-inning spell
enough runs were scored and the damage was done to where they'd
lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove is trying to rectify the failure to focus. ``I came in
emphasizing the mental side of the game,'' he said. ``When there
are too many distractions, you're not concentrating and focusing on
what you're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Many elements of the game, Hargrove added, are beyond the
players' control. ``The one thing you can control,'' he said, ``is
the mental side. You can control whether or not you make a mental
error and to be tough mentally. If you can accomplish that
consistently enough during the season, if the talent level is where
you think it is, then the talent has a chance to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said he used the same approach in Cleveland. It
evidently worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them bought into it,'' he said. ``There are always
going to be a few who think you're full of baloney and try to drag
other people with them. But it's paid off here so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans are not exempt from reminders about the importance of
having the right mental attitude, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even they may forget the intensity level that needs to be
achieved,'' he said. ``I believe at the big-league level that's the
separator between the winners and the losers because the talent is
fairly comparable.''
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons the Orioles have been comparable to two
teams _ the Yankees in pay, the Devil Rays in finish.

A-PLANT SALE IS SHROUDED IN UNCERTAINTY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Va., Miss., Conn.)  (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Power Authority's attempt to sell its two nuclear
plants remained mired in uncertainty and speculation Tuesday after
it decided late Monday to postpone choosing a buyer because of an
assortment of tax, legal and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the dust settled after an unexpected 11-hour meeting on
Monday night, the biggest question was whether one of two bidders
for the Indian Point 3 plant in Westchester County, and the James
A. FitzPatrick reactor in Oswego County, on Lake Ontario, was still
involved.
</P>
<P>
   That bidder, Dominion Resources of Richmond, Va., had said that
its original offer, which it valued at $857 million, would expire
at 11:59 p.m. Monday. But as the deadline approached, the power
authority said that it was still uncomfortable with some aspects of
Dominion's proposal and that it would delay its decision until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dominion gave no indication of what it would do next,
saying only that ``we're considering our options,'' said Mark
Lazenby, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of hedging suggests that Dominion has not, for now,
simply abandoned its quest. If Dominion does drop out, then the
winner, by default, would be Entergy Nuclear of Jackson, Miss.,
which had submitted an offer it valued at $806 million.
</P>
<P>
   And while Carl Crawford, an Entergy spokesman, said that his
company, like the power authority, was still waiting for Dominion
to act, he said he was confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've got a very superior offer already on the
table,'' he said.

<P>
   At stake is the largest sale, by far, of nuclear plants in U.S.
history. As such, what happens with these plants has implications
for electricity customers, the environment and the economy and may
well affect the structuring of deals for nuclear plants like the
two Millstone reactors for sale in Waterford, Conn., and the Indian
Point 2 plant in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not selling a corner cigar store,'' said
Clarence D. Rappleyea, the chairman and chief executive of the
power authority, during Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, the major sticking point was the issue of
decommissioning the plants when they are judged to be no longer
useful.
</P>
<P>
   The power authority is expected to pay for the costs of
decommissioning, and has been building a fund, now valued at $630
million, in anticipation of those obligations. By 2015, when the
licenses of both plants are to expire, that fund is expected to
stand at $1.9 billion, which is more than enough to cover the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's projection of $1.18 billion to
decommission the plants. Anything left over would be kept by the
power authority.
</P>
<P>
   But if that fund were subject to taxes because the public power
authority sold its plants to a private entity like Entergy or
Dominion, or if that fund were to be counted as taxable income for
the new owner, then taxes would eat into that $1.9 billion. And if
that new, taxed figure were less than the NRC's $1.18 billion, the
new owner would have to make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Shoenholz, a spokesman for the power authority, said
Tuesday that the authority's tax lawyers had concluded that the
fund would probably remain tax-exempt. But just to make sure, the
authority wanted to see how the two bidders would handle the
possibility of unexpected taxes, and, Shoenholz said, Entergy that
had resolved the possibility satisfactorily and that Dominion had
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have the assurance that we would not have the
exposure,'' Shoenholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what happens over the next few days, as
Dominion considers its options, the power authority expects that
its board of trustees will choose a winning bid at its next
meeting, on Tuesday in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be done Tuesday,'' Gerard D. DiMarco, a trustee,
said after Monday's meeting.

MARGARET ROSEZARIAN HARRIS, MUSICIAN AND EDUCATOR, 56 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Rosezarian Harris, a musician and educator who was the
first black woman to conduct the symphony orchestras of Chicago,
Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota and 11 other American
cities, died on March 7 in New York City. She was 56 and lived in
Elmsford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Sandra G. Owen, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was born in Chicago on Sept. 15, 1943, the only child of
Dewey and Clara Townsend Harris. Before her fourth birthday, she
played a public piano recital of 18 short pieces and three encores,
all performed from memory. She was soon performing in halls as far
from home as the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, earning
as much as $2,000 a performance.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 6, her parents ended the tours and placed her in
school. At 10, she performed with the Chicago Symphony and won a
scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. Harris' mother
moved with her to Philadelphia, working there as a dressmaker. Her
father, a Pennsylvania Railroad mechanic, remained in Chicago,
visiting his wife and daughter regularly until his death in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Harris later earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the
Juilliard School. Her graduate work was supported by a grant from
the Leopold Schepp Foundation. Harris would later become a trustee
of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Though piano was her first love and she played solo recitals in
the United States and abroad, Harris gained the most prominence as
a conductor. She worked on Broadway as well, notably as music
director of the musical ``Hair,'' a position she took over in 1970.
Her orchestra was made up of seven male musicians, all older than
she.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't give me a bit of trouble personally or
professionally,'' Harris was quoted as saying in a New York Times
article about this pioneering engagement for a black woman. She
added, ``It's like having an unlimited charge account at Saks Fifth
Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she was invited by the United States Information
Service of the United States Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to
serve as an American cultural specialist for a production there of
``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her compositions are two ballets, an opera called ``King
David'' and two piano concertos, the second of which was performed
twice with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Harris was appointed associate dean of the
Pennsylvania Academy of Music in Lancaster, a position she was
scheduled to assume in June.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

RAMON MITRA, 72, FOE OF MARCOS REGIME DURING MARTIAL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ramon Mitra, who rose from rural poverty to become a leading
politician and democratic foe of the Marcos dictatorship in the
Philippines, died on Monday in Manila. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Local news reports, citing family sources, said the cause was
liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Mitra was a journalist, a diplomat, a
senator, a member and speaker of his country's House of
Representatives and minister of agriculture. He was a prisoner of
President Ferdinand E. Marcos' martial-law regime of the 1970's,
then was appointed by Marcos' successor, Corazon C. Aquino, to
negotiate with the Communists during their festering insurgence.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his own bid for the presidency in a seven-way race in
1992 to Fidel V. Ramos. But six years later, his support of the
winning candidate, President Joseph E. Estrada, gained him the
presidency of the state-owned Philippine National Oil Corp., a post
he retained after his cancer was diagnosed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mitra was the illegitimate child of a penal colony administrator
and a woman who died while he was an infant. He was raised in
poverty by a grandmother, worked his way through school and was a
journalist before going to law school.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the diplomatic service in 1951 and held posts in
Washington and the United Nations. Entering politics, he served in
the House of Representatives in the 1960's.
</P>
<P>
   Mitra's wide following among young people helped him win the
largest vote for senator in 1971. But it was a time of discontent
and violence, with Muslim rebels fighting the army in the southern
Philippines and rashes of political terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 President Marcos imposed martial law throughout the
country for the first time since the Philippines won independence
from the United States in 1946. Mitra and other opposition figures,
including their leader, Sen. Benigno S. Aquino Jr., were rounded
up, jailed by the military and sidelined politically.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from exile, Aquino was assassinated in 1983, two years
after martial law was lifted. Mitra made his political comeback in
1984 as an opposition member of the Marcos-dominated legislature.
In 1986, widespread unrest and the Marcos regime's increasing
isolation drove Marcos into exile in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Mitra became a political ally of Aquino, who presided over the
turbulent transition to a still fragile democracy. He served her as
minister of agriculture and helped her in one of her main themes,
to reconcile the country's feuding elements.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he held secret cease-fire talks in 1986 with the
Communists, who were holding on to their bases in the mountains.
Their meetings, he reported, resembled a reunion of ``old friends''
from his days as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   News reports in Manila said that his survivors included his
wife, Cecilia, and their six sons.

RUSH HAS BRUINS SOARING WITH HIS PASS-DUNK PLAY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JaRon Rush is such a special player to watch because there is
always the chance he will do something dynamic when UCLA has the
ball. All he has to do is make eye contact with point guard Earl
Watson, begin his ascent to the basket and then soar above the rim
to accept another lob pass and finish the play with a spectacular
dunk.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gorgeous play, the type the Bruins look for every moment
Rush is on the floor and the kind that obviously demoralizes
opponents. A dunk off a lob pass counts for 2 points, but it
definitely inflicts more psychological harm than a 15-foot jump
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a lob on a team, the crowd gets into it and
you're excited about it,'' said Rush, a 6-foot-7-inch sophomore
forward. ``The intensity picks up, your defense picks up,
everything picks up and it's hard to slow it down. That's why I
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   This athleticism, this fearless attitude and this high-flying
approach is what makes UCLA a dangerous team in the Round of 16.
Suddenly, a team whose coach figured he might be fired a month ago
and a team that barely qualified for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament might be the most popular pick to
win a championship if fans could destroy their office pool sheets
and start all over again. Suddenly, the Bruins have won eight in a
row and are flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Rush said. ``We're just out there having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the point of UCLA's turnaround is simple. It began when
Rush returned. He was suspended by the NCAA for one and a half
seasons last Dec. 10 for accepting $200 from an agent and benefits
from an Amateur Athletic Union coach. After UCLA appealed Rush's
suspension, it was reduced from 44 games to 24. There was still
time to help salvage a tattered season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard lesson,'' Rush said. ``I wouldn't want to
go through it again. Obviously, it's something I won't do again.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rush back on the court, the Bruins, who had limped to a
13-11 record, are 8-0. While Rush said that he is playing at about
85 percent speed, he looked in peak condition with 14 points and
six rebounds in the 105-70 demolition of Maryland in the second
round of the Midwest Region. The Bruins made the Terrapins look
like a junior varsity team that had wandered into the gym.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA might have the deepest team in the country as 12 of the 13
players have started at least one Division I game and the 13th is a
walk-on. Watson is a confident leader who had the superb
statistical line of 17 points, 16 assists and no turnovers against
Maryland. He underwent laser surgery to seal a hole in his left
retina on Monday but expects to play on Thursday when UCLA (21-11)
opposes Iowa State (31-4) in Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kapono, a freshman, changes headbands if his touch from
the 3-point arc is off, which is rare. Jerome Moiso is a quick,
left-handed power forward who likes catching lobs and dunking as
much as Rush does. Dan Gadzurik has tendinitis in both knees, but
the 6-11 center from the Netherlands is a strong presence in the
middle. Still, of all the Bruins, Rush is the Energizer Bunny. What
he can do with his long arms, spindly legs and incredible ability
even amazes some of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush puts pressure on the defense,'' Watson said. ``He forces
the defense to be aware of lobs at all times. He can catch it from
anywhere. I can throw it from half court and he'll still catch it.
He's got such soft hands. He jumps up in the air so high and he
doesn't care if he comes down and falls on his head. That opens up
the 3-point shot and the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, who has a skull with a top hat and ``No Fear'' tattooed on
his right bicep and a sinister wizard holding a basketball and
``JaRon'' on his left bicep, ditched his humility and conceded that
he did provide the wayward Bruins with a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring a lot of intensity and defensive pressure and a
presence on the court that teams have to play against,'' said Rush,
who is averaging 12.9 points and 5.6 rebounds in 21 minutes. ``That
opens up things for other players to get more shots.
</P>
<P>
   Once Rush was suspended, he went from playing against the best
players in the country every day to playing alone only twice a
week. Rush could not find a decent game on campus, so he
languished. He thought about playing professionally in Europe and
wondered if he should prepare to leave college for the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing else I could do,'' Rush said. ``It was real
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush called it a depressing experience, but he did not let
Watson or his teammates see that side of his demeanor. He called
Watson, one of his childhood buddies from Kansas City, Mo., before
every game and wished the Bruins good luck.

GREER COULD JOIN LIST OF LATE-BLOOMING SLUGGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Rafael Palmeiro was a line-drive hitter
during his first full five years in the big leagues, posting a high
average, scoring a lot of runs and averaging fewer than 20 home
runs a year.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he was what Rusty Greer is today.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro gradually changed, breaking through with 37 home runs
in 1993, his sixth full season. Throw out the strike year of 1994
and he has averaged 41 home runs and 122 RBI in his past six full
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He said Greer could make a similar transformation into a
high-average hitter who also has considerable power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the guy is a better hitter than I was at that
age,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Raffy about it,'' said Greer, a career .309
hitter who averaged 19 home runs in his first five full seasons.
``According to his theory, there will be a time when it happens as
you learn about yourself over the course of time. You learn how to
look for your pitch at a certain time and try to pull it. Hopefully
it's something I can accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro did it. So too, did Carl Yastrzemski and Stan Musial,
two Hall of Fame left fielders who didn't develop their full power
potential until they reached the stage of their careers that Greer,
31, is at now.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said he and Greer take the same basic approach at the
plate. They look for a good pitch and try to hit it hard. The
difference is there are times when Palmeiro goes to the plate
deliberately looking to hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do it every time,'' Palmeiro said. ``You might do it
50 to 75 times out of the year where you know the pitcher is going
to make a certain pitch. Sometimes it might change in an at-bat, if
you work the count in your favor. But out of 50 at-bats, you might
hit five to seven, maybe another 10 home runs. Add that onto the 20
or so Rusty hits by accident, and he could hit at least 30 in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I hit three home runs last year on a 3-0 pitch,''
Palmeiro said. ``Why take on a 3-0 pitch when you know the pitcher
is going to give you a fat pitch? But it has to be your pitch. In
the playoffs, El Duque (Orlando Hernandez) was behind 3-0, and I
was looking for a fastball on the outer half of the plate. But he
threw a fastball inside, and I took it for a strike, then ended up
walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back to the dugout, Johnny (Oates) said, Raffy, you
know you had the green light, don't you? I said, yeah but it wasn't
the pitch I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzemski followed a similar path as Palmeiro during his Hall
of Fame career. He hit for a high average but low power during his
first six years. Yastrzemski, a rookie in 1961, won a batting title
in 1963 but through 1966, his career-high in home runs was 20. Like
Greer, Yastrzemski was a line-drive hitter who used the entire
field.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after working extensively with Ted Williams, Yastrzemski
learned to pull more, especially in favorable counts, and he had
his breakthrough season in 1967, hitting .326 with 44 home runs and
121 RBI. He hit 40 home runs in 1969 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Musial didn't hit more than 19 home runs in his first five years
in the big leagues. But in 1948 he jumped to 39 home runs and
averaged 32 per year from 1948-54.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is being confident enough to be able to do that,''
said Greer, who said he never tries to hit a home run even though
he has hit some of the biggest for the Rangers in the past five
years. ``But once you're able to do that, I think it can start
snowballing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Palmeiro: ``You look at Ken Griffey. He'll tell you he's
not a home-run hitter. But when he goes up to the plate, he can
envision a home run even before the pitcher has thrown the ball
because he's done it so many times before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzemski, Musial and Greer have one thing in common. All
three hit a lot of doubles early in their careers. In the previous
four seasons before 1967, Yastrzemski averaged 38 doubles a year,
leading the league three times. Musial averaged 42 doubles in his
first five seasons. Greer has averaged 39 doubles a year for four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows me he's capable of hitting for more power,''
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was able to make his transformation without sacrificing
average or racking up high strikeout totals. He hit a career-high
47 home runs last year while hitting .324. He also walked 97 times
and only struck out 69 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pick my spots,'' Palmeiro said. ``I'm not a guy like (Jose)
Canseco, where's it's all or nothing. He's still a great hitter,
but if he's up there with runners at second and third, he still
going to try to pull the ball out of the ballpark. He's not going
to try and hit a line drive over second base.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said the important thing is Greer is already a .300
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy who hits .300 can learn to hit with power,'' Palmeiro
said. ``It's almost impossible for a guy who hits for just power to
learn to hit .300.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez had a similar breakthrough last year. A
.300 hitter the previous four seasons, Rodriguez hit .332 last year
but also went from a career-high 21 home runs in 1998 to 35. He
also drove in 113 runs which, combined with his defense, earned him
the American League's Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Pudge it was a combination of things,'' Rangers hitting
coach Rudy Jaramillo. ``His conditioning program helped make him
stronger, and his mechanics were smoother. But part of it, too, was
being more selective at the plate, looking for his pitch and
driving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer is among the best hitters in the game. Besides hitting
.300 or better in five of six seasons, he has scored at least 100
runs and driven in at least 100 runs in three of the past four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But, while he remains the one of the most popular Rangers, he
has received little recognition nationally. He has not be selected
to the American League All-Star team, and honor usually reserved
for power hitters
</P>
<P>
   ``People who go to The Ballpark know what I can do,'' Greer
said. ``They know I'm going to go out there every night and perform
to the best of my ability. Not everybody can be a national name.
There are guys who are known nationally, and that's OK. I like to
blend in the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go quietly about your business, you get things
accomplished, almost like sneaking up on people. A good way to get
things done by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Power hitters don't surprise people. Rusty Greer could in time.

ATHLETES SPOTLIGHTED IN BATTERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER AND LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - It's happened again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems to be happening all the time.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres outfielder Al Martin, whose off-season home is
in the Phoenix area, was arrested Tues day, March 21, on domestic
violence charges.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Phoenix area's third incident of domestic violence
involv ing a professional sports athlete in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   One week before, Arizona Cardinals running back Mario Bates
spent a night in jail on two misdemeanor domestic violence charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Bobby Chouinard faces a more
serious charge after allegedly pulling a gun on his wife on
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Every few days, it seems, the na tional media report on another
professional or collegiate athlete get ting busted for beating up a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful, warns Richard Lap chick, director of
Northeastern Uni versity's Center for the Study of Sports in
Society: The prevailing public sentiment _ that college and
professional athletes are more prone to assault women _ is flat
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not in any way with athletes,'' Lapchick said.
``The prob lem is American men.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressions of athletes are inspired by American media, he said,
which report on about two assaults weekly by sports professionals.
Each time a jock gets busted for hitting his wife or girlfriend,
Lapchick said, journal ists call in search of a trend story.
</P>
<P>
   What goes unreported, he added, are the 8,200 other batterings
and 2,014 other rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lapchick said research clearly shows that athletes are more
likely to avoid arrest, conviction or severe penalties when they do
attack women. But that's also true of other wealthy males who can
afford good lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is truth to stereo-typi cal notions of locker-room
machismo which degrades women, and to the idea that athletes are
pampered and protected.
</P>
<P>
   Those attitudes clearly affect the romantic and sexual relations
be tween athletes and women, he added, but they don't translate
into higher rates of physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Lapchick said, most research ers have found that
assaults by males on females cross every professional, social,
racial and economic line.
</P>
<P>
   The O.J. Simpson murder case, more than any other, inspired
academic research and journalistic investiga tion of female assault
by high-level athletes.
</P>
<P>
   What investigators found, in most cases, was inconclusive. Some
re searchers reported evidence that jocks have a heightened
propensity for violence against women, but most said the athletic
celebrities merely got more publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Al Martin was arrested on domestic violence assault and threats
charges, both misdemeanors, while Shaun Haggerty-Martin, who claims
to be Martin's wife, was arrested for do mestic violence assault.
Both spent the night in the Scottsdale city jail and appeared
before a judge Tues day, March 21, morning.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Police Sgt. Doug Dirren added that police are
investigating Haggerty-Martin's claim that Martin is married to
more than one woman. If so, Martin could face felony bigamy
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin also told police that Monday, March 20, wasn't
the first time she and Martin had fought. According to a police
report, she said when the two lived in Florida a couple of years
ago, he beat her severely, requiring her to go to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Scottsdale in No vember, Haggerty-Martin added
they have had several fights, one in which Martin allegedly pinned
her to the bed, choking her and stuck the barrel of a gun in her
mouth, threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's, March 20, fight, she says Martin said, ``If you
cheat on me, lie to me, betray me, I will O.J. (you) so quick. I
will torture you. I'll tie you up and cut you and pour alcohol on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego general manager Kevin Towers said Tuesday, March 21,
he and Padres owner John Moores spent about 90 minutes with Martin
and the woman reported to be his other wife, Cathy. Towers
described Martin as ``not in a good emotional state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't condone domes tic violence,'' Towers said.
``It's unacceptable. But before we come down on Al, we want to get
all the facts from both sides of it before we discipline him.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers said to the best of his knowledge Haggerty-Martin is ``an
acquaintance (Martin) has known for four or five years since his
days in Pittsburgh'' and that they have ``had some problems in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's wife knows of her,'' Towers said. ``We did not get into
the depth of what has happened in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   After her release Tuesday, March 21, Haggerty-Martin _ who had a
large bruise on her chin _ declined to say whether Martin was still
married to his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   On the Padres' Internet site, Cathy is listed as Martin's wife
and the mother of his 8-year-old son, Bran don.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates on Feb. 23, was not
at Peoria Sports Complex on Tuesday, March 21, as the Padres won
over the Chicago Cubs. Towers said he ex pects Martin to take some
time off.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale police said they will inves tigate Haggerty-Martin's
claim of bigamy. Martin told police he at tended a ceremony with
her in Las Vegas in 1998 but did not believe it to be a real
wedding ceremony. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The vandalism appeared to be another in a disturbing
pattern of desecrations of Roman Catholic icons. And once more it
was in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a two-foot-high concrete statue of Jesus, its arms
detached, was discovered Tuesday morning on a patch of grass in
front of an Episcopal church in Park Slope.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, after the police had strung crime-scene tape
and detectives had asked questions, investigators said that the
incident did not appear connected to a recent string of 11
anti-Catholic incidents in which sculptures throughout the borough
had been smashed or toppled.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion, though, offered little comfort to Catholics
across Brooklyn, who since Sept. 26 have watched with consternation
and sadness as the faces of statues have been shattered, their arms
and hands torn off, in front of churches, convents, a Knights of
Columbus hall and even a private house.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Inspector Barbara Sicilia, the commander of the police
bias unit that has been investigating the vandalism, said
detectives believed the 11 desecrations were committed by one
individual or a group working together.
</P>
<P>
   Chips and markings from the statues have revealed, she said,
that the same ``hammer-type instrument'' and a ``chisel-type
instrument'' may have been used in all 11 previous cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sicilia said the latest incident did not appear to be connected
to the earlier ones because it did not involve a Catholic church
and because there was no mutilation of the statue. No one has
reported missing a figure of Christ like the one found Tuesday at
All Saint's Episcopal Church at 282 Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Sicilia said police officers throughout the borough have been
alerted to watch for the vandals, and patrols have been added on
weekend evenings, when most of the vandalism has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also met with church officials and asked
parishioners to provide any tips or recollections of suspicious
activities. ``Everything that could be humanly thought of has been
done,'' Sicilia said. Evidence that might lead to a suspect,
though, has been scant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we know is that every single one of these
attacks has been anti-Catholic,'' Sicilia said. ``What their
motivation is, what the thinking behind it is, we're open to any
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sacrilegious act,'' said Guylaine Bordes, a
longtime parishioner at St. Jerome Church on Newkirk Avenue, the
first church to report the defacing of a statue. ``It's almost like
you have a war with God, attacking him one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the vandalized statues have been sculptures of the
Virgin Mary, but statues of Christ have also been defaced.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident in January at the Knights of Columbus hall in
Canarsie, a statue of Saint Pius X, who was pope from 1903 to 1914,
was decapitated. A sign found taped to the remains called the
current pope, John Paul II, ``Satan who deceives the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened the first time, it was shock,'' said Msgr.
Rollin Darbouce, the pastor of Holy Cross Church, on Church Avenue,
where a 53-year-old statue of Mary was defaced last week. The
statue's face was smashed and its hands lopped off in the last act
of vandalism in the pattern. ``When it happened the second time,
it's indignation and rage and anger because you do not expect
something like that to happen in a civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   Public officials, Catholic leaders and other concerned citizens
have offered rewards totaling $76,000 for information about the
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one seems to have a clear explanation for the
incidents, some said they saw the vandalism as a vicious
desecration of sacred icons that was ``aimed at things that are
uniquely Catholic,'' said Patrick Scully, spokesman for the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, which monitors
anti-Catholic sentiment and actions.
</P>
<P>
   The statues ``have been there for years,'' he said, ``and they
mean a lot to people. This is an attack on people and the images
that they hold dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Mottley, a parishioner at St. Francis of Assisi-St.
Blaise Church on Maple Street in East Flatbush for more than 20
years, said she and others at the church had been especially
disheartened that vandals struck their church twice.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend of Jan. 8, someone lopped off the arms and heads
of statues of Our Lady of Fatima and St. Francis of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on March 12, a wooden sculpture of Christ, which had been
mounted on a cross in front of the church, was found in pieces on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' Mottley said, likening the vandalism to someone
smashing photographs of her family. ``This is a part of the church.
This is what we grew up with. You cannot have a church without the
statues. This is what we know.''

EDITORIAL: REUNITING A FATHER AND SON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 22:
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing a lawsuit by relatives of Elian Gonzalez who
sought political asylum for the 6-year-old Cuban boy, U.S. District
Judge K. Michael Moore has essentially upheld the decision of
Attorney General Janet Reno and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service that the boy should be repatriated to Cuba to rejoin his
father. Moore's ruling should be read as affirming INS Commissioner
Doris Meissner's declaration in January that Elian is too young to
make legal decisions for himself and that his father has the sole
legal authority to speak for him in immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking political asylum for Elian, his Miami relatives are
asking the government to make a judgment about the best interests
of a child that contradicts the expressed wish of his only
surviving parent. A powerful tradition in American law has
repeatedly asserted that parents, not the state, know what is in
the best interests of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, the only basis for removing a child from his or
her parents is demonstrated abuse, neglect or abandonment by a
parent. To date no one has produced any evidence to suggest that
Elian's divorced father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is anything but a
devoted father. INS officials interviewed Gonzalez at length in
Havana last December and were satisfied that he had maintained a
close and involved relationship with his son.
</P>
<P>
   It is now nearly four months since Elian was rescued at sea from
the incident that killed his mother and several others. His Miami
relatives have indicated they plan to appeal Moore's decision. That
is their right. But each passing day further postpones a
long-overdue reunion between a father and his son. In light of the
clearly articulated views of the attorney general and the
Immigration Service that Elian should return home to Cuba, his
relatives in Miami ought to prepare to comply with the law and let
him go.

   PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. _ Don't open the refrigerator down in Room
37 in the basement of the research-minded Paul D. Schreiber High
School. What looks and smells like a science experiment going on in
there actually  &UR; is  &LR; a science experiment. But it doesn't belong to
Viviana Risca. Hers was made famous last week in Washington, where
she won the nationwide Intel Science Talent Search (and a $100,000
scholarship) with a project that encoded a secret message in a
strand of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Except for her fanciful misconception that a computer mouse
would resemble a little gray rodent rather than a blob of plastic
(the reality, which descended in seventh-grade, was a
disappointment), Risca, a 17-year-old senior, has always been a
glutton for fact-finding. She first became ``a research groupie''
in ninth-grade, on the day a light went off in her head,
Edison-style. It happened during a class next door in Room 36 when
she figured out how DNA works: ``I fell in love with biology.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was a sophisticated student _ at her request, her
maternal grandparents read her Greek myths _ before she arrived in
New York in 1992 from Drumul Taberei, near Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   A nervous third-grader who spoke only fragmentary English, she
was installed in the same grade, no remedial arrangements
necessary, in the Sachem district, on Long Island, just two days
after saying goodbye to her home, friends and, chaperoned by
grandma, taking her first international flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents threw me right into the waters _ they indoctrinated
me pretty early that hard work is what matters,'' says Risca. Her
parents, both engineers, left Romania ahead of her in 1991 and
pursued workaholic schedules here so that she and her younger
sister, Anca, would want for nothing, especially not a college
education.
</P>
<P>
   For Risca, a worrywart who recalls obsessing about the bill for
her college education ``ever since I was in elementary school,''
winning the top Intel prize over 39 other finalists has removed an
old stress and replaced it with new ones. Which college should she
attend, Stanford or Yale or MIT or Harvard or Princeton or ... you
get the problem. And if she goes to a science school like MIT, to
pursue a head-spinning double major in computer science and
biology, will she miss out on her second passion, the humanities?
</P>
<P>
   According to her, ``the depressing part'' of being the big
winner is this: Even $100,000 doesn't take care of the whole
enchilada anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always tell me not to worry,'' she says in her
quick, accented English, ``but it's too late for that. I worry.
Sometimes I theorize that I should just go and be a farmer in the
Great Plains states.'' (That's a carry-over from weekend hikes in
the Carpathian Mountains with her grandparents, who taught her to
love nature.) Instead, she's on a path that carried five previous
winners of the competition to a Nobel Prize; might her
inquisitiveness take her that far?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to fathom; so is that $100,000 scholarship, which she's
still not sure she deserves. (Risca confesses that the Intel
project that impressed her most belonged to a Florida girl who,
without benefit of a mentor like hers, Dr. Carter Bancroft at Mt.
Sinai School of Medicine, created a poison for a weed that was
choking her community's fields.) ``The way she persevered, that's a
great example of a scientist following a theory to the end,'' she
says. Then again, Risca wasn't even sure she deserved the oil
paints she got one birthday: ``I'm not that good of a painter.''
</P>
<P>
   What she is sure about is the impatience that led her to ignore
the Nancy Drew books the rest of the third-graders devoured her
first season in America _ ``Once you've read one Nancy Drew, you've
read them all'' _ and sneak to the science shelf for a dose of
Isaac Asimov. Then came her determination to find the source of
pulsating variables in stars, a quest that took her to Columbia
University's physics library at 14, the same year she spent her
summer as an NYU lab intern trying to isolate a gene in a parasitic
organism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a phase where I wanted to be a fashion
designer,'' she says. ``I had Barbie dolls, but I didn't play with
them. I made beaded outfits for them. But I outgrew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Risca, a poetry aficionado, dresses like a '50s beatnik,
long hair pulled into a massive bun, plenty of black on black, the
hem of her jeans artfully frayed above a pair of low-top sneakers.
You were expecting, perhaps, a lab coat, horn rims, sensible
brogues, and a fistful of dissecting tools? Not for this fan of
Frost and Plath who edits her school's literary magazine when she's
not busy cooking up experiments for the contests that dot the
calendars of teen-age scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure from all over the place,'' Risca observes of the new
phenomenon of the teen-age science nerd as a hot recruiting
property. And the competitions! Her Intel booty, the scholarship
check and a laptop computer, are still in the mail, but Risca has
already entered this week's Long Island Science and Engineering
Fair at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   The new project is called ``Image Scale Estimation Using Genetic
Programming in Java.'' To Risca, who believes silicon chips will be
outmoded soon, Java is computer-speak, not a beverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with the way robots see,'' supplies Phyllis
Serfaty, a biology teacher who heads the special science research
program Risca entered in her sophomore year. ``But it's way out of
my league. That's Viviana.''

IOWA STATE WON'T BE BRUINS' ONLY TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ As if the UCLA Bruins don't have enough to
worry about this week with Iowa State, All-American Marcus Fizer
and the pressure of a Sweet 16 showdown, there's the small matter
of ... FINAL EXAMS.
</P>
<P>
   Winter-quarter finals are this week - both on campus and in the
Bruins' hotel near The Palace of Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard for quarter-system schools,'' UCLA athletic
director Peter Dalis said. ``It's a very difficult situation. But
the coaches and academic staff constantly talk to the kids about
time management.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins block time each day for study hall, tutoring and
exams. Academic counselor Mike Casillas, who works for the college
of letters and sciences, keeps the exams in sealed envelopes.
Unless time zones, practices or games conflict, the players take
exams at the same time they're administered on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, professors eschew road-trip exams and insist the
players take makeup tests when they return to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is professor-specific,'' said associate athletic
director Betsy Stephenson, who oversees academic counseling. ``We
work with them and notify them at the beginning of each quarter
about each athlete's travel schedule. Traditionally, they're
flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the calendar, final exams usually conflict with the
second weekend of the NCAA Tournament, the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight
rounds. It's an odd way to celebrate. They returned from
Minneapolis late Saturday night, studied Sunday and Monday, then
left Tuesday morning for Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple finals Thursday and Friday, so I'll have to
take those on the road,'' freshman forward Jason Kapono said.
``We've got to play and take finals, so it's a full platter.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost a Cyclone: Bruins point guard Earl Watson was recruited
by former Iowa State coach Tim Floyd during his years at Washington
High in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is now the head coach of the Chicago Bulls, but he made a
lasting impression on Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa State was right there with UCLA from the beginning, but
I've wanted to play at UCLA since I was a kid,'' Watson said. ``I'm
proud of my decision and would never think about it again.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. tie: Current Cyclones coach Larry Eustachy attended Arcadia
High, Citrus College and Long Beach State. Although he was a big
UCLA fan and wanted to play for coach John Wooden, he's never
wanted to coach in Westwood. He prefers the small-town pace of
Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up, UCLA always had tape-delayed games at 11 p.m.
on the march to 10 (NCAA) titles,'' Eustachy said. ``I remember the
days of Henry Bibby. There wasn't a player in the country who
didn't want to go to UCLA. I went to Citrus College as a
non-scholarship player - that's how close I was to UCLA. I thought
I should have played at UCLA, and I was the eighth man at a junior
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a country boy. I grew up in L.A. and my parents live
there, but I like to live in places where you don't have prepay
gas. I like to pump and pay. Smaller towns are more my style.''

JONES WON'T ALLOW COWBOYS TO FALL FROM NFL GRACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Jones had nothing to say Tuesday. Odd but true.
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically about his old rivals, Eddie DeBartolo
and Carmen Policy, and about the ongoing tempest that swirls around
the San Francisco 49ers, the Cowboys owner took the high road and
sent word that he'd really rather not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people that Jerry considers his `fraternity
brothers,' and he feels that any comment he might make would be
inappropriate,'' a Cowboys spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers franchise is in transition, which is a polite way of
saying their Super Bowl owner is facing a felony offense, the
family has been fighting over its $1.5 billion, and come Thursday,
a federal judge in Minneapolis is going to help decide whether the
Niners cheated the NFL salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Did I mention the 49ers finished 4-12 last year?
</P>
<P>
   The free-fall in San Francisco might not be over yet, depending
on what NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is empowered by the judge
to do in the salary-cap scandal. The new 49ers owner, Denise
DeBartolo York, and her husband, John York, turned in the former
front office for irregularities in the contracts of quarterback
Steve Young, former tight end Brent Jones and former backup QB Jim
Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both the players' agents and the team could be fined
as much as $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the closing credits. The better story here is
that a proud franchise with a glorious Super Bowl heritage has
somehow gone down the porcelain bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a Cowboys fan, reading each day's episode, you
have to wonder: Could the Cowboys be the next 49ers?
</P>
<P>
   The happenings of this off-season loudly suggest that there's
not a chance. Amid speculation, some of it fueled by the owner
himself, that the Cowboys would enjoy a winter of frugal, more
measured spending, Jerry Jones has wheeled and dealed and spent the
franchise back into playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's signing of defensive lineman Alonzo Spellman was but
another example. With defensive end Greg Ellis' status still
uncertain after breaking a leg, the Cowboys could not afford to see
their line further disrupted by Spellman signing with the Green Bay
Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, since they meekly excused themselves from the postseason in
January, the Cowboys have lost Randall Godfrey, Kavika Pittman,
Jason Garrett and Eric Bjornson, and the departure of Deion Sanders
is imminent. But they added the most notable free agent available,
receiver Joey Galloway, and then signed cornerback Ryan McNeil and
tight end Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Count Do-Rag, the self-indulgent Sanders, the
Cowboys will go to training camp in July with more weapons on
offense and a capable fill-in for Deion in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   None of these moves will send Jones into bankruptcy court. He
has prospered financially mostly by being able to renegotiate
veterans' contracts and prorating signing bonuses. Jones has done
it with an eye toward the NFL's salary cap, both its current
ceiling and tomorrow's.
</P>
<P>
   It will be intriguing to see the particulars that spill out
Thursday in court in the 49ers' cap-cheating case. Two of the
agents involved, Leigh Steinberg and Jeff Moorad, know Jones and
the Cowboys well.
</P>
<P>
   Where Jones seemed to differ from Carmen Policy, DeBartolo's
former club president, is in knowing how much and how far to string
out the players' deferred payments. As a member of the NFL's
broadcasting committee and an oil wild-catter at heart, Jones has
correctly gauged the growth in the league's salary cap and spent
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, four of the five networks delivering NFL games
complained about declining audiences. Some owners wondered if a
prudent gesture wouldn't be giving the networks a rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Jones nearly choked. He urged the committee to swing open the
negotiations to other networks.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting eight-year, $17.6 billion deal delivers Jones and
each NFL owner $73.3 million per season. Jones has elected to turn
a significant portion of that back into signing bonuses each
season.
</P>
<P>
   The team will take a $3.2 million salary-cap hit when Sanders is
released in early June. The retirements of Daryl Johnston and
Michael Irvin would cost them another $2 million. But other than
the contracts of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Darren Woodson,
Jones will not be paying millions to a ``team'' already past its
Cowboys years. He learned that lesson when Jay Novacek, Charles
Haley and Tony Tolbert were forced to retire prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the DeBartolos announced that a settlement had
been reached in their long and bitter feud. The sister and her
husband get the 49ers and their planned new stadium on Candlestick
Point. Eddie, the brother, gets a turn in a Baton Rouge, La.,
court, where he is soon to testify in the extortion trial of
ex-governor Edwin Edwards.

EDITORIAL: FALSE MISSILE DEADLINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 21:
</P>
<P>
   With important technical problems still unresolved, the Pentagon
has now postponed the next, crucial test of America's projected
missile defense system for nearly two months, until late June. With
time needed to analyze the results, that means President Clinton
will be in no position to make an informed decision about whether
to build the system before this fall at the earliest. The issue is
too important to be decided in the heat of a presidential campaign
and should be deferred until Clinton's successor takes office.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is considering building a limited system of
radars and interceptor rockets based in Alaska and aimed at
countering future missile threats from North Korea, Iraq and Iran.
Constructing such a system, which would require modifying or
abandoning the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia, could
have weighty consequences for America's security and relations with
other nuclear powers. Any decision to proceed should be based on a
thorough testing program and careful diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the new testing delay, leading Republicans and
Democrats were urging Clinton not to rush a decision. The initial
summer deadline was set last year under strong Republican pressure
for quick action. But the politics of the issue have changed. Sen.
Joseph Biden, senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee,
recently joined Republicans like Sen. Chuck Hagel and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in urging that the decision be
left to the next president. Gov. George W. Bush declared last
December that he would not object to such a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has so far responded coldly to American proposals for
amending the ABM treaty to permit a limited defensive missile
system. But bargaining may be possible after Sunday's Russian
presidential elections. Washington needs to leave sufficient time
for negotiating possible revisions, which would have to be ratified
by Congress and Russia's parliament. Building a missile defense
against North Korea at the cost of a new nuclear arms race with
Russia would make little sense.
</P>
<P>
   There are also sound scientific reasons for delay. The main
prototype system for intercepting enemy warheads failed one test
and only partially passed another. That second test revealed
problems affecting the interceptor's vital heat-sensing system,
leading to the latest postponement. Missile threats from North
Korea, and possibly Iran and Iraq, will need to be taken seriously
during the next decade. But before Washington decides to build a
system, it must be certain the weapon works. Clinton is not likely
to know that during the remaining months of his presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maj. Ivan Hirst, the British army officer responsible for
getting the Volkswagen factory running again after World War II in
what is now Wolfsburg, Germany, died March 10 at his home near
Marsden, in Yorkshire, England. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Without his efforts, Volkswagen probably would never have
shifted from its failed dream of producing a people's car for the
Third Reich into the economic powerhouse that built the Beetle, the
symbol of German recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who drives a VW owes a lot to Major Hirst,'' said Ryan
Lee Price, editor of VW Trends magazine, a publication for Beetle
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Hirst was born March 4, 1916, in Saddleworth, England. He
studied at the University of Manchester and worked for a time in
his family's optical instrument business.
</P>
<P>
   He turned a youthful interest in motor vehicles into an
assignment in the tank repair service for the British army during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, he was evacuated at
Dunkirk after the fall of France in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Later transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers, he returned to Europe as head of a tank repair group in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   It was from there that he was ordered in August 1945 to the
former ``Strength Through Joy'' City, a sprawling forced-labor
factory between Berlin and Hanover. The city was soon renamed
Wolfsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Captured by the Americans, the mile-long, bombed-out plant
Hitler had built was then turned over to the British.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's last wartime products were parts for V-1 rocket
bombs and stoves for soldiers on the Eastern front. The work was
done by about 15,000 slave laborers, prisoners of war and others.
</P>
<P>
   Sent to the plant without orders, Hirst found the workers still
there and on his own initiative decided to use them. In his repair
and motor pool service, he found fearful ex-Nazi administrators,
refugees from the Soviet sector 15 miles to the east and former
slave laborers mingled suspiciously in an economy where the prime
currency was American cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The slave laborers were soon sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst recalled in a 1962 magazine article that he and his
commanding officer, Col. Michael McEvoy, who had driven an early
version of the Volkswagen in 1938, spray-painted army green one of
the few Beetles around and drove it to their local headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1945 the two officers persuaded the British
military to place an order for 20,000 vehicles to serve local
troops and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Without that order, the machinery in the plant would probably
have been disbursed among the occupying powers and the factory shut
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst scrounged for steel and other rare materials to keep the
plant going.
</P>
<P>
   By 1946, 8,000 workers were producing 1,000 vehicles a month.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1949, Hirst helped recruit Heinrich Nordoff to take
over management of the company, and he led VW until 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst left in August 1949, when the company was set up as a
trust run by the new West German government.
</P>
<P>
   Nordhoff later said that ``by one of the ironic jokes history is
sometimes tempted to produce, it was the occupation powers who
brought Hitler's dream into reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In another twist of fate, after 1945 the British motor industry
proceeded to decline while the German automobile industry that
Hirst helped revive flourished, leading the so-called German
economic miracle of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Rootes, a longtime leader of the British auto
industry, told Hirst that his factory would collapse within two
years. A formal engineering evaluation of the Volkswagen undertaken
by the British military also found little potential, declaring
``the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirements
of a motorcar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too
ugly and too noisy,'' he continued, then added famously, ``If you
think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody
fool, young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was by no means a perfect car,'' acknowledged Hirst in a
1999 BBC interview, ``But in its time, it was a damn good little
car.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the original Beetle surpassed the Model T as the
most-produced car ever; to date, about 22 million have been made
and limited production continues in Puebla, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   William Bowman of St. Louis, a collector of old Volkswagens, was
one of a group of Beetle fans who visited Hirst last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sharp as a tack and had wonderful stories,'' Bowman
recalled of an evening spent with the Hirst in a pub in Marsden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't understand why we thought what he had done was
such a big deal,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   A familiar figure at the pub, with his clipped white mustache,
ascot and pipe, Hirst reminisced until nearly midnight.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the army, Hirst worked for the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. He retired in 1975
and his wife, Marjorie, died some years ago. He had no children.

 &HT;    Gun maker rejects settlement on guns
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice and Alfred Charles
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Glock Inc. has decided not to join a handgun
settlement that the federal government reached last week with Smith
&AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest firearm manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Glock officials made the decision Tuesday afternoon during a
one-hour conference call between the firm's Smyrna manufacturing
plant and headquarters in Austria. The ultimate decision was made
by Gaston Glock, the company chairman and inventor of the pistol
that bears his name, said Paul F. Jannuzzo, Glock Inc. vice
president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more expensive this way, but we're doing it
because our company is run by one man and he's a highly principled
individual,'' Jannuzzo said from his Marietta, Ga., home. ``He's
just simply not going to kowtow to this kind of extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's decision comes as Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and
other big city mayors are expected to announce a plan today to
purchase weapons only from firearm manufacturers that agree to
install safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is scheduled to make the announcement during a joint
news conference in Washington, D.C., with Andrew Cuomo, secretary
of the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department, and mayors of
Miami, Detroit and nearly a dozen other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   The cities, which purchase firearms for their law enforcement
officers, hope to use their combined buying power to try to force
the nation's gun manufacturers to follow the lead of Smith &AMP; Wesson
and sign on to last week's landmark pact that requires new handgun
safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Glock could be affected because more than half of all U.S. law
enforcement departments use the company's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   HUD is involved because there are 3,200 public housing
authorities nationwide that purchase handguns for their officers.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for last week's agreement, the Clinton
administration and 15 of the 29 municipalities that have filed suit
against U.S. gun manufacturers agreed to drop pending litigation
against Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of the cities that filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beginning step toward making our communities
safer,'' said Campbell, who spent much of Tuesday attending the
funeral for slain Fulton County Sheriff's Deputy Ricky Kinchen,
gunned down last week while attempting to serve a warrant.
Campbell's office said he has already issued an executive order
stating the city's preference for buying guns from manufacturers
that agree to install safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Glock executive Jannuzzo, who participated in the secret
negotiations that led to the agreement, said he heard from scores
of police officers and other Glock enthusiasts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 197 to 5 against the deal,'' Jannuzzo said. ``Cops
don't like this any better than any of us. They don't like the idea
of preferences. The most important thing is user confidence. If
they have to buy a gun because the government blackmailed them, I
don't think it inspires that kind of confidence.''

WILL INDOOR GAME BE GOOD FIT FOR MARINOVICH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Avengers' practice pants didn't
arrive in time for the first morning of training-camp drills Monday
- such is life for an Arena Football League expansion franchise -
so the team arranged to borrow gear from USC.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why one Avenger spotted a familiar name inscribed
in faded ink on the waistband of the pre-owned white britches he
received from equipment manager Richard Rubio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still had MARINOVICH written on them, with about five
other names, crossed out,'' Todd Marinovich said. ``And they still
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich told that story Tuesday for the benefit of anybody
wondering if the decade since college has damaged his physique as
much as his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   A lanky 205 pounds, he can squeeze into the same pants in which
he practiced to beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day
1990 and win a classic shootout against UCLA later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll slip back into big-time professional football as
easily, using the Arena League as an audition stage the way Super
Bowl MVP Kurt Warner did, is a bigger question.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years have passed since Marinovich's NFL career ended with
the Los Angeles Raiders releasing him after two seasons best
remembered for the day he skipped practice to go surfing (naked).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he served three months in jail on felony
marijuana misdemeanor drug convictions; he tried without success to
pass tryouts with NFL teams from Seattle to New Orleans; and he
tried the Canadian Football League twice, backing up Marcus Allen's
brother Damon with the British Columbia Lions last year.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1999 season ended, the California native decided to
call it a CFL career and come home. After Arena League owners
settled a contract dispute with players earlier this month,
permitting roster moves to resume, Marinovich's agent contacted the
new L.A. team.
</P>
<P>
   How convenient, since the new L.A. team had been thinking about
Marinovich for months. A contract was signed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great name in L.A.,'' Avengers owner Casey Wasserman
said at the team's West Los Angeles College training camp. ``Todd's
clearly a talented football player and we think he can help this
team. Does he have some history? Yeah. But he's 30 years old now
and he probably has some perspective he didn't have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wasserman noted, the 14-year-old Arena League has ``the
strictest drug policy in all of sports,'' featuring random surprise
tests, one-year suspensions for first-time offenders and lifetime
bans for repeaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a place to screw around, this is not the
league to do it in,'' Wasserman said. ``This is a chance for him to
go one of two ways. This could be a great place to rebuilt his name
and relaunch his career. Or, who knows, this could kind of be the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman himself is only 25, the grandson of former
MCA/Universal boss Lew Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   Being five years older than the owner might be the least of
Marinovich's obstacles as he prepares for the 14-game Avengers
schedule that begins April 15 in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   There's the fact arena football, played with eight-man sides on
a 50-yard artificial turf field and emphasizing quick-release
passing, bears only a little more resemblance to the football
Marinovich is used to than miniature golf to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   There's the arena game's image as a novelty sport, perhaps
insufficient to hold the interest of a man like Marinovich, whose
passions run to painting, wood sculpture and rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the sobering news that, at least at first,
Marinovich will be the Avengers' backup quarterback, watching and
learning from Arena League veteran Scott Semptimphelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is going to be, will he get bored?'' said
head coach Stan Brock, the former NFL lineman. ``He already knows
he's very good at the other (outdoor) game. Will he able to
challenge himself to learn a new game which is perceived as semipro
football? If Todd can handle it mentally, and not being the guy at
the beginning, then he has the skills to play this game, no
question about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically saying, `I was wrong, I did a lot of wrong
things, and I'm going to try to do something correct now.' If he
can accomplish this, there will be a lot of NFL people saying, `He
can handle our system again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, who is living in Marina del Rey, insisted he isn't
thinking about his troubled past or a future in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (arena ball) is a good game for a quarterback to
work on his skills,'' he said, sunglasses tilted back on a freckled
forehead. ``But I'm not looking that far down the line. Hopefully,
I'm going to compete, be a starter on this team and help them win.
I look at it as a great opportunity to get back and play some great
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, working out on a West L.A. College field marked in
arena dimensions, the old left-hander showed the familiar zip on
his fastball and appeared quite fit in those old Trojans pants.
What we know so far is that the Arena Football League has expanded,
but Todd Marinovich hasn't.

PROJECT EQUALITY TO OVERSEE ADAM'S MARK HOTELS' COMPLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Adam's Mark hotel chain agreed Tuesday to settle racial
discrimination lawsuits brought by the U.S. Justice Department and
others. Project Equality, a small nonprofit agency based in Kansas
City, was chosen to monitor the hotel's compliance with the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark Hotels &AMP; Resorts, based in St. Louis, has 21
properties in 14 states, including the Adam's Mark near the Truman
Sports Complex. The company was sued last year by the government
and private plaintiffs, including the NAACP, over alleged
discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stemmed from incidents last spring in Daytona
Beach, Fla., when guests at a black college reunion alleged they
were singled out as security risks and required to wear bright
orange wristbands.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark agreed to pay $4.4 million in damages to reunion
guests and $1.5 million to the state of Florida to establish
scholarships as well as hotel and hospitality management
internships at four historically black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest and most comprehensive settlement ever of a
racial bias case involving hotels, attorneys said. The settlement
terms still must get the approval of a Florida federal district
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam's Mark is committed to equality and has never
intentionally done anything wrong,'' President and Chief Executive
Fred Kummer said Tuesday. ``We apologize for any actions that may
have made any of our guests feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, at a Washington news conference,
hailed the agreement as ``a model for the future'' and said Adam's
Mark ``is the first hotel chain of its kind to take such
comprehensive affirmative steps to prevent discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said in Baltimore that ``with this
agreement, the call for economic sanctions against the hotel chain
has been suspended.''The NAACP helped bring the private lawsuit and
has urged people to boycott the chain.
</P>
<P>
   The government selected Project Equality, a 35-year-old,
church-based nonprofit agency, to act as its compliance officer
during the four-year settlement period.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will investigate complaints, design and monitor
diversity and nondiscrimination training programs for 9,000 Adam's
Mark employees, oversee ``secret shopper'' tests to ensure
compliance, and develop a marketing plan to reach
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring role is one of the largest tasks ever undertaken
by Project Equality, said Kirk P. Perucca, its president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The organization conducts workplace audits and provides
diversity training for its members and others, including scores of
churches, national and regional religious organizations, the
American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association
and the YWCA of the USA.
</P>
<P>
   It also publishes an annual buyer's guide of goods and services
that lists more than 3,000 companies that meet Project Equality's
diverse work-force standards.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark hotels have been listed in the buyers guide since
1987 and last year became a $1,000 annual corporate sponsor of
Project Equality, Perucca said.
</P>
<P>
   The still-undetermined value of the Adam's Mark monitoring
contract for the government will likely dwarf Project Equality's
annual budget of around $300,000. More employees will be hired to
supplement the full-time staff of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new opportunity for us,'' Perucca said at a news
conference Tuesday in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the undertaking in 14 cities, Perucca said his staff was
undaunted and experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what discrimination is all about,'' he said.
``Our goal is to make sure Adam's Mark values every guest that
walks through their doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Equality was retained by Adam's Mark last year in the
wake of the lawsuits to audit its policies and practices and
conduct training for workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department on Dec. 16 charged Adam's Mark with
discriminatory practices, alleging that black guests were being
charged more than whites, often for less-desirable rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, the Florida attorney general filed a motion to
intervene in the NAACP's class-action lawsuit filed in May alleging
that Adam's Mark discriminated against black college reunion
visitors last April.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Adam's Mark noted Tuesday that the chain's
Daytona Beach hotel later this month will be a host location for
the annual black college reunion gathering.

REPEAL OF GAS TAX IS A NO-WIN SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress apparently has dropped its bid to repeal the
4.3-cent-per-gallon fuel tax to help motorists pinched by rising
pump prices.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons make sense but also reveal how tax policy is often a
no-win situation for those paying the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   When the tax was imposed, it was to ameliorate record budget
deficits. The deficit problem abated, but the tax was retained to
finance transportation outlays. Proponents claim the revenue is
still needed even though much of the fuel tax money isn't being
used for its intended purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest economic argument against repeal is that
it would make it easier for OPEC to keep oil prices high. Another
argument, noted in an analysis by the House Transportation
Committee, was that eliminating the tax wouldn't necessarily
translate into lower pump prices. This is especially so for this
particular tax. It isn't collected at the pump, but just after it
leaves the refinery. Thus it's highly questionable whether all the
intermediaries involved from production to pump would pass along
the savings instead of pocketing it.
</P>
<P>
   As much sense as these arguments make, they also raise a
compelling question: Why do those elected to represent our
interests devise taxes whose repeal seem to benefit everyone except
those who pay the tax?
</P>
<P>
   This tax's supporters have an answer for that question too. It
would cost us jobs and money. Repeal would mean the loss of 840,000
high-paying jobs in 2002 and 2003. Tens of millions of dollars in
spending on construction equipment and materials also would be
lost. Speaking of money, a breakdown by transport committee
analysts shows Missouri losing $460 million in highway funds in
2002 and 2003 and Kansas losing almost $217 million. All states
would lose a grand total of nearly $19 billion over those two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is the worst of all worlds. OPEC's pricing
hand is strengthened, upward of a million good jobs are lost, and
states lose infusions of billions critical to improving
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises several other questions. What happened
before the advent of this tax? What happened after 1993 that made
this tax so critical to our well-being? Most important, why not
just cash in IOUs from the Highway Trust Fund to cover losses from
the tax's repeal?
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund, after all, has swelled from $9 billion to $24
billion since the mid-1990s. Isn't this a good time to dip into
this rainy day ``savings''?
</P>
<P>
   The committee report addresses this option by noting it would
require ``using most of the non-Social Security budget surplus for
transportation (needs).''
</P>
<P>
   What, you may ask, has the non-Social Security surplus got to do
with it? Well, this surplus is the most obvious source of funds
needed to redeem the Treasury IOUs constituting the Highway Trust
Fund. There's no real money in the fund, which means real money
must come from elsewhere in the budget to cash in the IOUs.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the $15 billion in pump taxes collected that
were transformed into trust fund IOUs instead of paying for
transportation stuff? It was spent on general budget outlays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, taxpaying Americans were left holding a bagful of
government debt in the form of trust fund chits.

SPELLMAN AGREES TO MULTIYEAR DEAL WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In signing defensive lineman Alonzo Spellman to
a one-year deal during training camp last year, Dallas Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones acknowledged he was taking a risk on a player
with a troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Spellman, 28, were rewarded for their gamble
Tuesday when the two sides came to an agreement on a new multiyear
contract. Details of the contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The former Ohio State star was unavailable for comment
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success he enjoyed and the contributions he made was
beyond anything I could have expected,'' Jones said. ``This is one
of the real positive sports stories about an individual being
challenged and meeting those challenges. This deal is justified in
terms of what he did for the team, how he played and how we expect
him to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement culminates a glorious comeback for Spellman. The
eight-year veteran played with the Bears from 1992-1997 before
sitting out the 1998 season after a string of bizarre off-the-field
incidents stemming from his battle with bipolar disorder, a mental
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Spellman _ who originally chose the Cowboys because
of the support programs provided by the team's behavioral
department _ not have any problems last season, but he made a
successful move from defensive end to defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Initially thought of as a fill-in for suspended defensive tackle
Leon Lett, Spellman played so well that Lett couldn't supplant him
as the starter when he returned midway through the season. Spellman
led the Cowboys with 22 quarterback pressures, tied for second with
five sacks and totaled 43 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo has been ``pleasantly surprised'' with
Spellman.. ``He was a good football player prior to getting to
Dallas,'' Campo said. But we didn't know what to expect. We are
fortunate that he has made the progress he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's presence makes the Cowboys' tackle rotation, which
also includes Lett and Chad Hennings, the strength of the defense.
Campo said Hennings and Spellman will be the starters heading into
training camp, though both will be challenged by Lett.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is also hoping Spellman can be an influence on newly
signed defensive end Dimitrius Underwood, who is trying to resume
his career after a series of troubles in 1999, including a suicide
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that he'll be a big influence
on a guy like Dimitrius,'' Jones said. ``How could it not be? A guy
that had to resurrect his career.'' HARRIS LOOKING TO BE STARTER
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones emphasized Friday that the signing of tight end
Jackie Harris had no impact on David LaFleur's status as the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Harris would serve as a complement to LaFleur, as an
H-back.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to introduce himself to the local media
yesterday, Harris, 32, emphasized that he chose the Cowboys over
his old team, the Tennessee Titans, because he was told he would be
given a chance to supplant the maligned LaFleur as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that if you produce, then it's a job that could
be yours,'' Harris said. ``David is the starter. Either David will
be better or he won't he the starter. All I wanted was a chance to
be the starter.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Smith is in the process of turning part of his $1.885
million base salary for next season into bonus money to help the
Cowboys with the salary cap. The Cowboys are also reworking the
contracts of other players.
</P>
<P>
   _ The search for a backup quarterback continues Wednesday, when
former St. Louis Rams quarterback Paul Justin comes in for a
workout.
