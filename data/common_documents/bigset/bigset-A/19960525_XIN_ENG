<HEADLINE> Germany Supports Poland's Bid for NATO, EU Entry, EU: Kinkel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany hopes Poland will be one of
the first east European countries to negotiate with the European
Union (EU) and NATO on membership, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with his Polish counterpart Dariusz Rosati, Kinkel
said that Germany will continue to support Poland's entry into the
EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's support follows Rosati's comments today in a German
newspaper urging NATO to decide on Poland's membership at the turn
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Rosati, who is in Germany for a day-long visit, said that by
then there won't be "any reason" for NATO to refuse his country
entry into the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Poland will have strengthened the civil jurisdiction of its
army and further promoted the coordination of its military
structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers also discussed bilateral
relations. Rosati said that Germany is Poland's "most important"
political partner in Europe and its largest economic partner.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, KEDO Sign Protocol to Protect Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) will guarantee the rights and legal basis for
international personnel to work in building light-water nuclear
reactors in the country.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and the Korea Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) have reached an agreement on protecting
international personnel in a consular protocol signed today in New
York.
</P>
<P>
South Korea today hailed the agreement, saying in a Foreign
Ministry statement that it "paved the way for the KEDO to proceed
with" the DPRK's nuclear reactor project, said reports from Seoul.
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington-Pyongyang Geneva framework
agreement signed in October 1994, two 1,000-megawatt light-water
reactors will be provided to the DPRK in return for freezing its
nuclear program. South Korea is the prime supplier of the
light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, the KEDO will enjoy diplomatic privileges
and immunities similar to those granted to international
organizations like the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the KEDO staff and government representatives from
KEDO member countries will be granted privileges and immunities
similar to those given to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the DPRK and the United
States in June last year, the KEDO, a multinational consortium led
by the U.S., South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying
two reactors to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Exports to Cyprus Hit All Time High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The economic ties between Cyprus
and the United States have witnessed a significant increase in
recent years, said the U.S. ambassador to Cyprus today.
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. pavilion of the Cyprus International State Fair,

<HEADLINE> WHO Concerns About Growth in Global Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
today warned against the growing tobacco consumption globally,
saying unless the trend is reversed, people killed by tobacco will
hit 10 million annually in less than 30 years, up from some 3
million in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of those deaths will occur in the developing
countries, where 50 percent of males on average smoke. In rich
nations, 62 million people, half of them middle-aged, will die
from smoking during the second half of this century.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts told a news conference that over the last decade,
tobacco consumption dropped in developed nations, but increased in
developing countries, particularly in China, which consumed 17
trillion cigarettes in 1993, or 31 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
The annual cigarette consumption per adult rose from 1,410 in
the early 1970s to 1,660 in the early 1990s globally. It grew from
860 to 1,410 in the less developed countries, from 730 to 1,900 in
China, and dropped from 2,910 to 2,570 in rich countries.
</P>
<P>
Notably, female smokers have been on the rise, especially in
rich nations, where only 2 percent of deaths among middle-aged
women was due to smoking in the 1950s, compared to 15 percent in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts said that studies show the death rates among
smokers, if they smoke long enough, three times higher than among
non-smokers, and that at least half the smokers will be killed by
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
In addition, passive smoking has become a cause of increase in
deaths among non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the tobacco-caused economic loss is estimated at 200
billion U.S. dollars annually, WHO experts quoted sources from the
World Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The world has now about 1.1 billion smokers, 300 million of
them in developed countries, 800 million in developing countries;
900 million of them males and 200 million females, consuming 15
cigarettes each day on average.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, they consumed over 52 trillion cigarettes. The three
countries of China, the United States and Japan alone accounted
for 47.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts said among tobacco control strategies so far
adopted, including requirements for warning on cigarette packages
and ban on smoking in public sites, heavier taxation on tobacco
products has proved very effective, which however implies
potential for increased smuggling.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the current 49th session of the World Health
Assembly (WHA) in Geneva approved two resolutions on tobacco
control today, one of them a framework global convention.
</P>
<P>
They are on top of 14 resolutions adopted by the WHA from 1970
to 1995.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Chechen Rebels to Hold Talks in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin will
hold talks with Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev here on
Monday to declare a ceasefire in the 17-month Chechen war and
start the peace process, reports reaching here quoted the top
Chechen military commander as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the talks, there will be a ceasefire ordered
by the two presidents. And at the end, they will sign a document
to declare the end of the war and the opening of a peace process,"
Aslan Maskhadov told western reporters in southern Chechnya
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said for the Chechen rebels "the first aim is to end the
war," but "We do not foresee any concession on the status of the
republic, but we are ready to put this question aside."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was expected to attend
the talks, said that leading opposition groups in the breakaway
republic today for the first time responded actively to the idea
of holding talks.
</P>
<P>
The heads of about 20 parties and movements opposed to
Chechnya's pro-Russian government called the planned talks "the
first step toward ending the war," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, during campaigning in the northern Russian city
of Archangelsk, confirmed Thursday that he had agreed to meet with
Yandarbiyev in Moscow before visiting Chechnya later this month.
</P>
<P>
Influential military commanders from the two sides might attend
the meeting, Yeltsin added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would be the first time the leaders in the 17-month
war have met and could mark a breakthrough in efforts to end the
Chechen war, although neither side has shown any sign of
compromise on the major sticking points.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Filatov, a close Yeltsin aide, said today that the
president had ruled out granting independence to the Muslim-held
republic.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is seeking "peace, preservation of Russia and its unity
and restoration of constitutional order in the Chechen republic,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Forces "not supporting the peace process and continuing to
terrorize society must either leave, or be destroyed, " he quoted
Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the head of Chechnya's pro-Russian government, Doku
Zavgayev, told Itar-Tass reporters that the Chechen opposition
leaders "are ready to make proper compromises for ending the war
and wish Moscow could hold a similar stand."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Parliamentary Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said today
that the talks which Yeltsin "timely and correctly" decided to
hold "will be beneficial in every way."
</P>
<P>
Russian troops today took control of Bamut, the last stronghold
of Chechen rebel fighters, which has held out for more than a
year, Russia's chief of staff General Mikhail Kolesnikov claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya declared itself independent in 1991, but Russia never
recognized this and sent troops to end the rebellion in December
1994.

<HEADLINE> New York State Outlaws Ephedra-Based Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, May 24 (Xinhua) -- New York state has imposed a ban
on the sale of ephedra-based products which were blamed for 15
deaths nationwide, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Classified as a natural herb and not a drug, ephedra can induce
a euphoric feeling or heart palpitations when taken in excessive
doses.
</P>
<P>
Sold in health food and novelty shops in the form of pills,
powders and sodas, the ephedra-based products have been promoted
as safe natural food supplements by about 100 companies and have
become increasingly popular among youths.
</P>
<P>
Last month the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned
consumers of the danger when taken in excess, especially to people
with high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, six carbonated beverages that contain ephedra will
be recalled.
</P>
<P>
The ban will be enforced by local and state public health
officials who will do spot checks of stores. Merchants violating
the ban will face fines of 2,000 U.S. dollars and prison terms of
up to one year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, according to the FDA, about 400 people have
reported adverse reactions to ephedra-based products, and 15
people have died.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today pledged to further strengthen
the partnership between the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a 90-minute meeting in the U.S.
Midwest metropolis of Milwaukee, Clinton said he and Kohl shared
common positions on an array of foreign affairs issues, including
the NATO expansion, the forthcoming Russian presidential elections

The United States and Germany today signed two agreements on
air safety and skies opening.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the partnership between our two nations has taken
another important step forward," Clinton said at a joint press
conference with Kohl. "The two aviation agreements we just signed
will strengthen our cooperation in this vital economic sector. The
safety agreement will help us to clear the way to better, safe air
traffic."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and German leaders said that they agreed to strengthen
the role of the western military alliance in the post-Cold War
changed world.
</P>
<P>
"We think NATO does have a role to play in order to secure
freedom for the peoples of the world," Kohl said. "And I think
that we should do everything, we should use prudence and
far-sightedness and wisdom, and to bear in mind also the changes
in the world today, and that we should pursue a course that bears
these changes in mind."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Kohl urged the international community to step up
efforts for the full implementation of the Dayton accord and
economic reconstruction in the former Yugoslav republic.

<P>
BONN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- German investment in overseas areas
increased by 80 percent over the previous year to an all-time high
of 48 billion marks (about 32 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Germany focused its investment mainly in Europe and the United
States while investment in Asia dropped slightly, the German
Economics Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Germany was 14 billion marks (10 billion
dollars) in 1995, a 2.7 billion marks (1.8 billion dollars)
increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
British investment to Germany was 2.7 billion marks (1.8
billion dollars), the biggest in all foreign investors. Asia also
doubled its investment in this central European country with an
investment of one billion marks (0.67 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said most investment was in the chemistry,
automobile, insurance, transportation and communications areas.

BONN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- German businessmen and industrialists
set up a new business group today to stimulate economic
development in southern Africa and to strengthen Germany's trade
links with the region.
</P>
<P>
Visiting South African President Nelson Mandela attended the

</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz boss Juergen Schrempp said at the launch ceremony
that southern Africa was a large and attractive market and would
soon be seen as an "African tiger" comparable to the fast-growing
economies of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Germany would back
southern Africa's economic integration and hoped that trade talks
between South Africa and the European Union would come to a
successful conclusion soon.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researcher Finds Immune System's "Off Switch" Protein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian researcher has identified
a protein that "flips the switch" to shut down the T-cells, the
white blood cells that kill invaders.
</P>
<P>
The finding of the protein, known as SYP, opens the possibility
of developing drugs to help boost defenses against cancers or
AIDS, or to control autoimmune diseases such as lupus or diabetes,
according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
SYP is a type of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, and is
produced within the cell on orders from a molecule on the cell
surface.
</P>
<P>
"The switch molecule, CTLA-4, acts as the general, ordering the
proteins, which are like privates, to do the physical work of
halting activity in the cell when the immune defense is complete,"
the paper quoted the researcher, Dr. Luc Marengere of the Ontario
Cancer Institute, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown in the chain of command allows the immune cells to
remain potent attackers and begin to attack friendly cells. Attack
by uncontrolled T-cells is believed to be behind many autoimmune
diseases such as lupus, diabetes and rheumatiod arthritis,
Dr. Marengere said.
</P>
<P>
SYP is the first of the proteins to be identified and there may
be others with specific effects that moderate immune responses and
shut the cell off, he said.
</P>
<P>
A different kind of proteins acting on another receptor gives
the order to turn on, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we can develop therapeutics that make use of this to
manipulate the immune system," either encouraging the chain of
command or breaking it down. However, the treatments on humans are
likely to be several years away, he added.

<HEADLINE> German Exports to Asia-Pacific Boom in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- German exports to the Asia-Pacific
region increased to 105.3 billion marks (68.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1995, a 12 percent increase over 1994, according
to figures released by the Economy Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The export boom has halved Germany's trade deficit with the
region from 17.3 billion marks (11.2 billion dollars) to 8.5
billion marks (5.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise in exports mainly to a program
known as the Asia Initiative, launched jointly by the German
government and industries.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the Asia-Pacific accounted for 16 percent of the
country's total foreign trade, making the region Germany's second
biggest trading partner after Europe, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Most German exports, mainly machinery, automobiles and
electronics, went to South Korea and Southeast Asia. Imports such
as textiles, food and electronic products came mainly from South

<HEADLINE> Nepali Climber Conquers Mt. Qomolangma 10th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali climber Ang Rita Sherpa
Thursday rewrote his own world record when he reached the world's
highest Qomolangma Summit for the 10th time.
</P>
<P>
Reports from base camp said that Sherpa scaled the peak along
with two members of a Sweden expedition through the tough south
pillar route.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Sherpa, owner of a Kathmandu Trekking agency,
had reached the summit of world's highest mount for 10 times since
 1983, and he never used oxygen in his climbing attempts.
</P>
<P>
Besides his outstanging feat of scaling Mt. Qomolangma, Sherpa
has climbed Mt. Cho-Yu and Dhaulagiri for four times, Kanchenjunga
 twice and Makalu and Sisapangma once, all these mounts above
8,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 13 climbers of two different expeditions succeeded
in conquering the 8,848-meter summit Thursday after waiting in
their camps for good weather in the past days.
</P>
<P>
Among them were four members of a Qomolangma expedition from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
David Finlay Breashears, 41, the expedition leader, and his
teammate Edmund Karl Viesturs, 37, succeeded to reach the peak in
their third attemp. Austrian film maker Hans-Robert Schauer, 43,
also scaled the peak.
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old Spainish physical therapist Aracei Segarra Roca
topped the summit with her teammates.
</P>
<P>
The weather in the Qomolangma region is reported to be normal
at present and all the climbers are safe.
</P>
<P>
A blizzard hitting the region earlier this month claimed nine
lives of climbers, including two Americans, two New Zealanders,
one Japanese, three Indians and one from Chinese Taipei.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Government Works Out Export Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
reportedly worked out a strategy to gradually increase the volume
of processed and refined goods in the country's export.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the strategy, according to a local press report
today, is to bring up the value of its export products.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, the industry's goals will include
diversifying export goods, broadening export markets, and shifting
to production and export of refined and processed goods.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese exporters are also urged to adopt measures to limit
environmental pollution in the production process of export goods.
</P>
<P>
In the last ten years, the industry focused on exporting crude
and semi-processed goods such as oil, rice and coffee.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Vietnam's export markets have been extended to the
Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 80 percent of the
country's total export value. Meanwhile, its export revenue has
increased annually by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total export earnings in the 1986-1995 period reached more
than 19 billion U.S. dollars, mainly from semi-processed farm
products such as rice, coffee, cashew nuts and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is targeting an export turnover of 45 billion dollars
under the government's economic development plan for the next five
years up to year 2000.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: Refugee Return Progress in Great Lake Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that the voluntary repatriation of
refugees in the Great Lake region has not progressed as it
expected, particularly "in light of funding problems."
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told a press briefing that the
UNHCR had received as of May 14 only 95 million U.S. dollars of
the 288 million it required this year for the repatriation program
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region were urged to do more to allow the
return of refugees. Redmond said that in April, only 3,000
refugees returned to Rwanda, compared to over 30,000 in the
earlier month.
</P>
<P>
According to him, representatives from the Organization of
African Unity, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, the United
States, the European Union (EU) and the UNHCR were meeting here
today to discuss the Burundi voluntary repatriation program for
1.7 million Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed the recent conflict in Eastern Zaire and its
security implications for the region at the technical-level
meeting. The UNHCR voiced concern over the increasing involvement
of neighboring areas in the conflict, which also threatened
humanitarian operations there.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said that the UNHCR is also concerned about the
situation in Burundi, especially "the fact that over recent weeks,
border controls have tightened, denying asylum to people who want
to go to Zaire and Tanzania."
</P>
<P>
Now the two countries together host over 200,000 Burundi
refugees. Since late April, he said, about 25,000 Burundi refugees
have flooded into Eastern Zaire, and several thousand more have
arrived in Tanzania.

</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said he had also met with

practical problems in the implementation of the peace agreement
and some problems of the local population and he would convey
these problems to international High Representative Carl Bildt

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Go Ahead with Privatization Drive: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Privatization is the
fundamental policy of the African National Congress (ANC) and
would be implemented as government policy, President Nelson
Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his return to Cape Town from his three-day state
visit to Germany, Mandela said privatization has always been an
element of government policy.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Germany, the president assured German
bankers that his ANC-led government was committed to
privatization.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said privatization should be a gradual
process, taking into account the conditions under which it has to
be brought about.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had received support from all the German
political, banking, industrial and cultural groups during what he
described as a successful visit.
</P>
<P>
This included support for investment, development aid,
education and South Africa's free trade negotiations with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the resistance to privatization by the
Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), Mandela said:
"we have to discuss it and bring our allies on board. I don't
believe that this will be difficult."
</P>
<P>
The president came out strongly in favor of COSATU's links
with the ANC and dismissed comments by Deputy President F. W. De
Klerk's statement that it is unacceptable for the federation to
be that close to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
"I can't prevent people from dreaming, COSATU is our ally.
They have a responsible leadership, far more responsible than
some political leaders in this country," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the government is prepared to discuss
the problem with role-players, adding privatization is the
fundamental policy of the ANC and is going to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the southern African economic summit in Cape Town
earlier in the day, De Klerk said COSASTU's resistance was the
main stumbling block to privatization in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his National Party is not opposed to unions, but
feels it is unhealthy for a union to have such a close
relationship with a political party.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Names US Ambassador to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today named Congressman Douglas "Pete" Peterson as the first
American ambassador to Vietnam in more than 20 years, the White
House announced.
</P>
<P>
Peterson, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of
Repreentatives since 1991, served as a fighter pilot and commander
in the U.S. Air Force from 1954 to 1981, reaching the rank of full
colonel. He spent six and half years as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the normalization of relations between the
United States and Vietnam in 1995 under growing pressure by
American business leaders and Congressmen to open up vast markets
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
But there are reportedly some 2000 American servicemen still
missing from the Vietnam War. U.S. officials believe that the
exchange of ambassadors between the two nations will help bring
about the best possible accounting of those missing people.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.S.) administration's emphasis is on full as possible
accounting of those missing in action," White House spokesman Mike
MaCurry told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clinton "will be addressing that issue
coming up as we get to the question of staffing levels for the
embassy in Vietnam."

<HEADLINE> Investors Have Nothing to Fear: De Klerk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Investors have nothing to
fear in South Africa and could rely on the continued application
of an acceptable economic policy, Deputy President F. W. De Klerk
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the southern African economic summit in Cape Town,
De Klerk said the African National Congress (ANC) has no reason,
nor could it afford, to change the economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the trade imbalance between South Africa and her
neighbors, De Klerk said economic development in those countries
have to take place before the imbalance could be addressed.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has to avoid the impression that it tries to
dominate the region with its economic power, he noted.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also said he is confident the country could establish
a "beach-head" for investment and development in the region, but
this has to be done "with our neighbors and not for them."
</P>
<P>
In this respect, South Africa should not be prescriptive, he
said, adding South Africa's stability depends on the stability of
her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said at the summit on
Thursday South Africa should seek to solve the problem of trade
imbalance with its neighbors, adding his government would soon
formulate policies to protect its industries.
</P>
<P>
While Botswana President Ketumile Masire said on Friday that
trade imbalance was harmful to the regional cooperation, but he
urged countries in the region not to resort to a trade war.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 southern African economic summit, which started on
Wednesday, is jointly organized by the world economic forum of
Geneva and the Southern African Development Community.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Prime Minister Urges Students to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi today asked the striking students to take a responsible
move and end their class boycott, which has entered its fifth
day.
</P>
<P>
"We'll demand they take full responsibilities for their
action," the prime minister told a briefing in Maputo, warning
that the government's prudence should not be misunderstood as
tolerance to law breaking.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi made the remarks after the students of the
University of Eduard Mondlane delcared an indefinite boycott of
class on Wednsday.
</P>
<P>
The students are demanding the minimum subsidy be raised to
400000 Meticais (about 36.3 U.S. Dollars) while the university
has promised to raise the miminum from the previous 140000
Meticais (about 12.6 U.S. Dolars) to a level ranging from 16000
to 250000 Meticais.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite boycott followed a round of seven-hour talks
between the students and University President Brazao Mazula on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The students, who have been insisting on meeting the prime
minister or Finance Minister Tomaz Salomao, began the strike on
Monday. The prime minister told reporters that he was too busy,
declining to say whether or not he or Salomao would meet the
students.

<HEADLINE> US Offers Nothing in Maritime Talks, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Participants to maritime
transportation negotiations under way here today voiced
disappointment about the position of the United States, which made
no offer in the multilateral talks to liberalize especially the
global port services market.
</P>
<P>
Peter Collins, head of the U.S. delegation to the negotiation,
said that the U.S. "has every intention of keeping the market just
as open in the future as it is now."
</P>
<P>
He said offers so far presented with the only exception of
those from OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development) countries are sadly short of the U.S. objectives and
that the U.S. could not see how offers of the major countries
could meet its expectations.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to see how the talks could be brought to a
positive end, he added.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations of the maritime transportation market opening, an
issue left over from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trading
talks, started in 1995 and is scheduled to conclude six weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
So far, 15 countries, with the European Union (EU) as one, have
submitted offers.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the talks said at the regular meeting today
that they are disappointed about the U.S. statement, and they
urged the Americans to re-consider.
</P>
<P>
Both the EU and Japan said the U.S. statement is totally
unacceptable. Without naming the United States, Japan said it is
concerned and disappointed that the offer from one major country
remains missing, which prevents progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The EU expressed serious annoyment, saying it is absolutely
unacceptable that six weeks before the deadline, one major partner
was continuing to remain passive and that whatever result in
future is not enough.
</P>
<P>
The EU added that the U.S. position is "incompatible" with what
it at Brussels has received from U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Japan were joined by other countries at the meeting in
criticizing the position of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, without mentioning the name, said one major country
has not lived up to the minimum responsibility of at least
submitting an offer.
</P>
<P>
According to it, the U.S. statement is "prejudging and
preempting" and Hong Kong does not share the U.S. assessment of
the offers submitted by others.

<HEADLINE> Israel Makes Effort to Turn Desert into Orchard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
decided to invest 1 billion shekels (about 333 million
U.S. dollars) to transform its barren Negev Desert into a
flowering region of orange groves.
</P>
<P>
The Negev Desert, which accounts for 60 percent of Israel's
territory, is visualized by the public largely as a geopolitical
asset and a backyard for heavy industry and military training
grounds.
</P>
<P>
The most visible impact of the ambitious program called Action
Plan Negev will be the orange groves already beginning to take
root in the Besor region.
</P>
<P>
Within six years, 50,000 dunams (4,695 hectares) of citrus are
to be planted in areas in the Negev that until a few decades ago
had been barren desert wilderness.
</P>
<P>
These transplanted groves will help maintain oranges at the
forefront of Israeli agricultural exports. The warmer climate will
enable Negev oranges to reach European markets ahead of foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
As incongruous as the orange groves in the desert are the
olive orchards whose planting has begun. Some 5,000 dunams (469.5
hectares) of olive trees in Ramat Hanegev area will provide the
base of an export-oriented olive oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The Action Plan will enable local farmers to tap into
high-tech hothouse agriculture, which would normally be beyond
their economic and technological reach.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for construction of hothouse parks in which
farmers will be able to rent completely outfitted hothouses and
be furnished with New Age technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
The sandy soil in much of the region is ideal for hothouse
growing. Alternatively, an infrastructure including packing
plants, refrigeration facilities and energy sources will be
provided alongside tracts on which farmers will build their own
hothouses.
</P>
<P>
In either case, the future of Negev agriculture rests in large
part on the growing for export of high-priced produce -- including
flowers, vegetables and seeds in the carefully controlled
environment of hothouses whose costs range from 50,000
U.S. dollars to 200,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin May Meet Chechen Rebel Leader: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
may meet Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in
Moscow Monday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said the information was provided by "a well-informed
source" on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, a working group of the
State Commission on Chechen Settlement held a session today to
prepare the upcoming meeting between Yeltsin and Yandarbiyev, who
became the leader of the Chechen separatists after Dzhokhar
Dudayev's death.
</P>
<P>
The group worked on documents expected to be signed at the
meeting and proposed May 27 as the date satisfying both sides,
Interfax said, adding that, however, the final decision is upon
Yeltsin, who is expected to return to Moscow Saturday from an
election campaign trip to Arkhangelsk and Vorkuta in northern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said earlier today
that Moscow had received "the first positive response" from
Chechen separatists to Yeltsin's proposal to hold peace talks
between the Russian president and Yandarbiyev with the
participation of Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"Other (Chechen rebel) field commanders who influence the
situation" may take part in the talks as well, Chernomyrdin
said. He also said that the meeting may be held "in the nearest
future," without giving an exact date.

<HEADLINE> Senate Confirms 3 Clinton Judge Appointees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-led Senate has
confirmed only three of U.S. President Bill Clinton's federal
court nominees this election year, but one leading Republican said
prolonged foot-dragging may reflect "unwise, short-term thinking."
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said in a recent speech, "Just because we
Republicans now control the Senate and the Democrats control the
presidency is no reason for us to ignore our fundamental
principles of fairness, decency and respect for the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
"When we are dealing with something as important as the
judiciary, we Republicans must think for the long term," Hatch
said.
</P>
<P>
He said some have urged Senate Republicans to "force floor
fights and hold roll-call votes on almost every single Clinton
nominee who does not share our judicial philosophy," or simply to
refuse to confirm judges.
</P>
<P>
"I think that these positions are flatly wrong, and that they
reflect unwise, short-term thinking," Hatch said. "First of all,
shutting down the Clinton nomination process ignores the fact that
there are numerous nominees whom Republicans support."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, it is not the job of the Senate to choose judges,
and I believe that the Senate must defer to the president's
choice, so long as the nominee is qualified, intelligent,
experienced in the law and understands that it is the job of
judges to interpret the law, not legislate from the bench," Hatch
said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine judicial nominations are awaiting action.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will travel to Europe in early June for a series of
"important meetings" with leaders and senior officials of the U.S.
allies in Europe and NATO, the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press briefing here
that Christopher had invited the presidents of Croatia, Bosnia and
Serbia to meet in Geneva on June 2 to "maintain the momentum on
the implementation of the Dayton peace accords."
</P>
<P>
It will be a new initiative by the Clinton administration for
the full implementation of the U.S.-brokered peace agreement in
the former war-torn Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the scheduled meeting "is consistent
with the secretary's determination that the United States remains
centrally involved in the effort to convince these parties to
commit themselves fully to implementing the Dayton accords."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Washington has been pressing the
leaders of the three Balkan nations to hold a free election in
Bosnia to establish executive and legislative structures.
</P>
<P>
Following the Geneva meeting, Christopher will participate in
the North Atlantic Council ministerial meeting in Berlin, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary will meet with foreign ministers from
Central European countries and Russia, the spokesman added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations General
Assembly today adopted a resolution and annexes to it on
restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the
economic, social and related fields.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly called upon the relevant intergovernmental
bodies to fully implement the measures for the restructuring and
revitalization, according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Annex I to the resolution noted that there was a need for a
substantial increase in resources for operational activities for
development, on a predictable, continuous and assured basis,
commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to mobilize the political will should be intensified
in order to achieve the objectives outlined in the present chapter
regarding funding of operational activities for development," it
said.
</P>
<P>
There was an urgent need to strive for the fulfilment of the
agreed target of 0.7 percent of the gross national product for
official development assistance as soon as possible, the annex
continued.
</P>
<P>
It said that the fundamental characteristics of the U.N.
operational activities should be their universal, voluntary and
grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism as well
as their ability to respond to the needs of developing countries
in a flexible manner.
</P>
<P>
"The operational activities of the United Nations system should
be carried out for the benefit of the developing countries, at the
request of those countries and in accordance with their own
policies and priorities for development," it added.
</P>
<P>
The annex also stressed priority to low-income countries, in
particular the least developed countries, and the countries with
economies in transition.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today said in a
statement that the new resolution is the first to have emerged
from a number of General Assembly working groups examining a wide
range of issues relating to the reform and renewal of the
Organization.
</P>
<P>
With the resolution, member states had reconfirmed the validity
of the role of the U.N. in operational activities for development,
fostered greater harmonization of the work of the Second and Third
Committees of the General Assembly, strengthened the capacity of
the Economic and Social Council and reinforced cooperation between
U.N. and the Bretton Woods institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the resolution launches an important series of
reviews to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
subsidiary bodies of the Council," he said.

<HEADLINE> CBI Cuts UK Economic Growth Forecast to 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown in manufacturing
industry has prompted the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
to cut its forecast for UK economic growth this year from 2.1
percent to 2.0 percent, well below the Treasury's forecast of 3.0
percent expansion.
</P>
<P>
The CBI says in its latest economic report today that there are
uncertainties about short-term economic growth, such as continuing
weak growth prospects in Europe and how far companies meet demand
by running down stocks, which may hold it even below its 2.0
percent forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI believes that the economy will "step up a
gear" in the second half of the year and through 1997, driven by
consumer spending and company investment in capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
The CBI predicts that the economy will expand by 3.0 percent in
1997. Manufacturing output growth is meanwhile expected to pick up
from just 1.0 percent this year to 4.0 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates are forecast to remain at the current 6.0 percent
for the remainder of this year and through 1997.
</P>
<P>
The most significant revision in the CBI's forecast is a more
pessimistic projection for government borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The public sector borrowing requirement prediction for 1996-97
has been raised from 24 billion pounds (36 billion US dollars) to
26.1 billion pounds (39.2 billion US dollars) and the forecast for
1997-98 from 20.5 billion pounds (30.8 billion US dollars) to 23.5
billion pounds (35.3 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> US Teen-Age Cigarette Smokers on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more u. s. young
teen-agers are becoming life-long cigarette smokers, which has
aroused grave concern by federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
The overall percentage of teen-agers 17 or younger who reported
smoking in the month of May was 34.8 percent up from over 30
percent in the same month of 1993 and 27.5 percent in 1991,
according to survey results reported on Thursday by Federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
The survey results culled from a sample of nearly 11,000
students in grade 9 through 12, which is consistent with the other
major research program tracking teeen-age smoking, an annual
survey by the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Health officials also found that cigarette retailers are not
serious about efforts to observe bans on cigarette sales to
children under 18. More than 75 percent of underage students who
bought cigarettes in the month before they were surveyed said that
they had not be asked to show proof of their age.
</P>
<P>
"Today's data from the C.D.C. provide the most dramatic
evidence to date of the need for strong measures to protect
children from tobacco marketing and sales," William D Novbelli,
director of th e Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington
lobby group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insists on Arrest of Indicted Bosnian Serb Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
categorically rejected the reported arrangement about the two
indicted Bosnian Serb leaders, stressing that they must be
arrested and sent to the international war tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
U.S. press reports today quoted Balkan and European Union
officials as saying that the United States and its NATO allies had
accepted arrangement where Bosnian Serb leader Radovan karadzic
and General Ratko Mladic remain in power as long as they withdrew
from public views and shed all formal duties.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was reportedly reached during a meeting between
U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum, top
international civilian representative in Bosnia Carl Bildt and
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the story, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns told reporters at a press briefing here that the reported
deal is not true and there was no "no deal" about the fate of the
two indicted Serb leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not agree to any deal for Karadzic
and Mladic," the spokesman noted. "They are indicted war
criminals. The only deal for them is to be arrested and brought
to the The Hague for prosecution, for a trial as war criminals."
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not be party, now or in the future,
to any set of negotiations that tries to let these two guys off
the hook," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
But Burns said that Washington welcomes the assurance that
Karadzic will be effectively marginalized over the next couple
of months.
</P>
<P>
"That's better than the current situation, where he remains an
actor in political life, but its' not good enough," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Credits for Two African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced
the approval of two credits totaling 116.4 million U.S. dollars
for Tanzania and Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
One credit of about 105 million dollars will be provided for
Tanzania's Urban Sector Project. The project is designed to
alleviate rising urban poverty and improve provision of basic
urban social services, both of which have worsened under the
strain of a 6.6 percent annual increase in the urban population in
the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The project offers funds for infrastructure improvements in
eight towns, and Dar es Sallam and Dodoma. The project finances
rehabilitation and expansion of roads, sanitation, and solid waste
management, a community-based infrastructure upgrading program,
training and technical assistance to strengthen local government
management.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of 11.4 million dollars is earmarked for Cape
Verde Private and Financial Sector Project. The project is
intended to generate employment in the formal sector through
increased foreign investment and foreign exchange earning
capacity, and to strengthen and improve the financial sector by
enhancing the functioning of the central bank and domestic
financial intermediation. The credit will also finance development
of an export processing zone, construction of factory shells to be
rented to investors, promotion of manufacturing activities and
tourism. The overarching project goal is to assist the
Government's efforts to integrate Cape Verde into the regional and
global economies.
</P>
<P>
The two credits will be provided through the International
Development Association (IDA), a concessionary lending arm of the
World Bank for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin May Meet Chechen Rebel Leader Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin may
meet Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Moscow on
Monday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said the information was provided by "a well-informed
source" on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, a working group of the
State Commission on Chechen Settlement held a session today to
prepare the upcoming meeting between Yeltsin and Yandarbiyev, who
became the leader of the Chechen separatists after Dzhokhar
Dudayev's death.
</P>
<P>
The group worked on documents expected to be signed at the
meeting and proposed May 27 as the date satisfying both sides,
Interfax said, adding that, however, the final decision is upto
Yeltsin, who is expected to return to Moscow on Saturday from a
election campaign trip to Arkhangelsk and Vorkuta in northern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said earlier today
that Moscow had received "the first positive response" from
Chechen separatists to Yeltsin's proposal to hold peace talks
between the Russian President and Yandarbiyev with the
participation of Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"Other (Chechen rebel) field commander who influence the
situation" may take part in the talks as well, Chernomyrdin said.
He also said that the meeting may be held "in the nearest future,"
without giving an exact date.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Industry Remains Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing demand in Britain
remains weak, with orders at their lowest for two and a half years
in May, says the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in its
latest monthly industrial trends survey which was published today.
</P>
<P>
A net balance of 17 percent of the 1,300 companies surveyed,
those saying orders are above normal set against those saying they
are below, reported order books below their usual levels,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The CBI says this figure, the same as in the previous survey,
shows clearly that orders are not improving and have been below
normal for nine successive months. It is also the lowest level in
a CBI monthly survey since December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders are concerned that the build-up in stocks of
finished goods, the highest recorded level of stocks since June
1991, poses a threat to the industr's recovery.
</P>
<P>
CBI leaders say that manufacturing demand is likely to remain
weak while the slight revival in exports over the past month
remains fragile as short-term growth prospects in Britain's key
European markets are poor.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fairness of Bangladesh's Coming Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Many Bangladeshis are worrying about
the fairness of next month's general election following this
week's near- mutiny in the capital and some find the official
version of the incident puzzling or a rather fishy story,
commentators and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Abdur Rahman Biswas, who has the Defense
Ministry under his charge, ordered the retirement of Chief of Army
Staff A.S.M. Nasim for disobeying the order to sack two of his
fellow army officers allegedly involved in political activities.
</P>
<P>
On that night, Dhaka residents were alarmed to see tanks
rumbling through the streets and troops guarding important
establishments such as the presidential palace, as forces loyal to
Nasim started to march towards Dhaka from the northern districts
of Bogra and Mymensingh.
</P>
<P>
However, the mutinous troops ceased their rebellion by Tuesday
evening and returned to their barracks after Nasim and some other
senior officers were put under military custody.
</P>
<P>
The bloodless end to the potentially violent developments,
though sparing the country another turmoil, has not dispelled the
fears for a disturbing prospect of the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
The former opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League accused President Biswas of acting in a partisan manner,
and termed the incident as a conspiracy of the ex-ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to spoil the June 12 poll.
</P>
<P>
AL chief Sheikh Hasina charged that Biswas, a bonafide BNP
follower, keeps the Defense Ministry under his jurisdiction as
part of the BNP's "preplanned conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
Controversy surrounding the president's action surfaced after
Nasim's interview with a foreign news medium in which he alleged
Biswas intended to use the army to rig the coming election in
favor of the BNP.
</P>
<P>
Both the president and the BNP have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Biswas argued that he was exercising his constitutional power
as supreme commander of the armed forces and by being in charge of
the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The BNP accused the AL of resorting to conspiracies to create
anarchy in the army and plotting to grab power through
unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
Some press reports said Biswas fired the army officers after he
got evidence of a planned coup designed to topple the caretaker
government, which included 17 audio cassettes of taped
conversations between the officers and leaders of an unnamed
political party.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said Nasim, who had initially inclined to the
BNP, made a U-turn to seek the AL's support for his position in an
alleged power struggle with his rivals in the army following the
forced step-down of the BNP government on March 30.
</P>
<P>
Each side is trying to lay the blame on the other, but the
attempted mutiny ended apparently in favor of the BNP, analysts
said, judging by the fury of the parties led by the AL over the
affair.
</P>
<P>
The former opposition parties demanded the president hand over
the Defense Ministry portfolio to the caretaker government in the
interest of holding the election in a "free and fair" atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
But AL chief Hasina refused to make clear whether her party
would withdraw from the polls again as it did in the February 15
election, if the president still keeps the defense portfolio
during the June 12 election. "Only time will say that," she said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed, however, that the election would be
held on schedule as neither of the rival sides could afford to
bear the blame for disrupting the poll and dampening people's
longing for stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
As well, the AL, whose popularity has risen since the BNP quit
power, would not let the chance of winning the election slip by
easily this time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sources said, some Western donor countries
have also warned the AL against making extreme reaction to the
recent incident in the army.
</P>
<P>
However, the fairness of the election remains in doubt, with
the army's dubious role in the election and a suspected diarchy in
the country's political regime, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A local weekly questioned in its latest commentary the future
role of the army, adding that while a neutral caretaker government
is charge, placing the armed forces under a "partisan president"
could not but be eyed suspiciously by the political parties other
than the BNP.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM to Present New Cabinet Line-up Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa is expected to present a new cabinet line-up to King
Bhumibal Adulyadej for royal approval Monday.
</P>
<P>
Banharn made urgent consultations today with leaders of the six
other coalition parties on the formation of a new cabinet,
following resignations of 10 cabinet members in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
The en masse resignations involved five members of the Therd
Thai faction of Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party and five
of the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) party.
</P>
<P>
The resignations resulted from a no-confidence debate at
parliament from May 8 to 10, when the opposition accused some
ministers of the Therd Thai faction of making personal gains
through power abuse and involvement in land and loan scandals.
</P>
<P>
The Therd Thai faction demanded that the Palang Dharma quit
the coalition for not casting the supporting vote for Deputy
Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen, a key member of the faction
and a major target of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Palang Dharma party responded by moving to leave a cabinet
that it said includes members unpopular to the public.
</P>
<P>
Palang Dharma leader Thaksin Shinawatra announced the
resignation of all its five ministers at a mass gathering last
night in a bid to seek public support for its Bangkok Governor
candidate Chamlong Srimuang.
</P>
<P>
A source from the New Aspiration party said today its party's
ministers are also ready to quit the cabinet, so as to give Prime
Minister Banharn a free hand to reshuffle the seven-party
coalition government.

ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto met here today a visiting Chinese delegation led by Li
Chengren, deputy head of the International Liaison Department of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto said that since the establishment of the
Pakistan-China diplomatic ties 45 years ago, the bilateral
relationship has been developing smoothly. China is a friend
trusted by Pakistan, she said.
</P>
<P>
She praised the role played by China in promoting peace and
maintaining stability in the region, adding that she hoped China
would play a more important role in international affairs.
</P>

The Pakistani prime minister reiterated her country's support
for China's stand on the issues of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet and
expressed the hope that the two countries will further enhance
their economic and trade relations and increase exchanges between
the parties and peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Li Chengren reaffirmed the CPC's four
principles governing inter-party relations: independence, complete
equality, mutual respect and non-interference into each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC has established friendly relations with
Pakistan's main political parties, including the ruling Pakistan
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the CPC and Pakistan's political parties
will be conducive to the enhancement of the traditional friendship
of the two peoples, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace Moves on Cyprus to Intensify in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Next month will witness a
stepped-up diplomatic activity on the solution to the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has announced that President Glafcos
Clerides will fly to Geneva on June 11 to see U.N. Secretary-
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
On June 18, he will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington and a day later British Premier John Major.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
will also meet the U.N. chief in Geneva around June 11.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, who suffered a heart attack earlier this year, had
hoped to confer with the U.N. chief in Istanbul, where he will
open a U.N. conference on June 3, but Boutros-Ghali agreed to meet
him in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
These meetings will take place following a stalemate in the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities on the island, which was divided in 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took control of northern third
following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
There have been no face-to-face meetings between Clerides and
Denktash since a series of informal talks in Nicosia in October,
1994 under the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the intensified diplomatic move was
appointment this month of a new U.N. special representative for
Cyprus, former foreign minister of the Republic of Korea Han
Sung-Joo, who is expected to visit the island early next month.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Britain named its former U.N. ambassador Sir David
Hannay as its representative for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has both a presidential emissary for Cyprus, Richard
Beattie, and a State Department co-ordinator, James Williams,
while Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum visited the
island last month.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have indicated that they may launch an
initiative on Cyprus after the May 26 parliamentary elections on
the island, which aims at bringing about a Clerides-Denktash
encounter in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts here have expressed their doubt
that the forthcoming peace moves would lead to a face-to-face
meeting between Clerides and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has denied an earlier report that
Clerides would be meeting with Denktash in June.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides has said that before the start of direct
talks, there should be an approach on decisive aspects on the
Cyprus problem including demilitarization, the withdrawal of
Turkish troops, security and future guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"Unless common ground is found on the basic aspects of the
problem, talks of any kind are doomed to failure," the president
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also called for a coordinated action on
Cyprus, saying that the efforts of the U.N., the U.S., Britain,
the European Union and Russia should be coordinated "so that we
don't get a Babel, but one concerted action".

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Minister: All Citizens to Get Equitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government will deliver
to its citizens equitable quotas of foodstuff that will be
purchased under the oil-for-food agreement between Iraq and the
United Nations, Iraqi Minister of Commerce Mohammed Mehdi Saleh
has said.
</P>
<P>
All the Iraqi citizens, including the inhabitants of the
autonomous region of Kurdistan, will get these quotas that will be
equal in terms of quantity and quality, the local Arabic daily
El-Gomhuria quoted Saleh as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organization on humanitarian program will take over
the distribution process in Kurdistan on behalf of the Iraqi
government, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United Stated and Britain tried to
discriminate against a certain section of the Iraqi people in the
distribution of the foodstuff when they meddled in the
Iraqi-U.N. talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi delegation insisted on the equitable
distribution among all the inhabitants of Iraq, including those of
Kurdistan, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The foodstuff that will be distributed according to the ration
cards will meet the needs of citizens in terms of quantity and
quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement will enable Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars of oil every six months to buy food and medicine for
its people hard hit by the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraqi
troops invaded Kuwait in August, 1990.

<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese traditional medicine
manufacturers are required to obtain quality licenses if they want
to export their products.
</P>
<P>
This is part of China's efforts to improve the quality of
Chinese traditional medicines and protect their overseas markets,
which have been shrinking in recent years, a Chinese traditional
medicine trader said.
</P>
<P>
"All Chinese medicines and their manufacturers must pass
quality checks by a quality inspection agency designated by the
State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine," according
to a new set of regulations issued jointly by the State
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, the Trademarks Bureau of
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and China's
General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
"Medicines and manufacturers who pass the quality inspection
will be issued quality registration certificates," the regulation
says.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign trade companies are only allowed to export the Chinese
traditional medical products manufactured by the enterprises which
have been awarded quality registration certificates," the
regulation continues.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will
implement strict quality control over Chinese medicine
manufacturers. "Those who are found to have quality problems will
be stripped of their quality certificates," the regulation says.
</P>
<P>
"The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will
demand that enterprises which have caused economic losses due to
poor quality pay recompense," according to the regulation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cities Strive to Increase Non-Grain Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Officials from China's ten biggest
cities have vowed to work harder to provide more vegetables, meat,
eggs, milk, fruit and aquatic products for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The officials met in this major port city in north China from
May 23 to 25 to discuss ways to strengthen the production and
marketing of non-grain foods.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the cities will introduce more
scientific achievements to boost agricultural production. In the
meantime, measures will be taken to enlive and standardize
vegetable circulation channels.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the markets for vegetables and other daily food products
were booming, thanks to the efforts of municipal governments, and
the demand was balanced by the supply.
</P>
<P>
In particular, meat production last year was 50 million tons,
an increase of 11 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials noted, with higher purchasing power and
the growing populations in Chinese cities, there is an
increasing demand for agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, farmland around cities is shrinking, the prices of
means of production for agricultural use are rising, and the
markets are not in good order.
</P>
<P>
All these problems should be promptly dealt with, the officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Meet Chechen Rebels in Moscow on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
today he will hold talks with Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev here Monday to end the 17-month war in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
But he vowed the rebel republic "will remain in Russia."
</P>
<P>
The talks will mark the first meeting between opposing leaders
in the Chechen conflict and could lead to a breakthrough in
efforts to stop the fighting as both sides seem to have
temporarily put aside the key issue of the status of the oil-rich
rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
"On Monday we will have discussions with all parties concerned,
including the armed forces, and I think that we will reach
agreement on a complete end to fighting," Yeltsin said in Vorkuta,
a northern city, where he was campaigning for his June 16 re-election.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-populated Chechnya will "remain in Russia, a united
and indivisible Russia," Yeltsin stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, Yandarbiyev, successor to former hardline rebel leader
Jokhar Dudayev, who died late April, told the Interfax news agency
Friday that both sides "are ready to make some comprises" at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, also expected to attend the
talks, is was reportedly busy heading a team drafting documents to
be signed at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Rebel military commander Aslan Maskhadov said Friday that
the talks will focus on a ceasefire and put the thorny issue of the
status of Chechnya aside.
</P>
<P>
"At the start of the talks, there will be a ceasefire ordered
by the two presidents. And at the end, they will sign a document
to declare the end of the war and the opening of a peace process,"
Maskhadov told reporters in southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of Chechnya's pro-Russian government, Doku
Zavgayev, told Itar-Tass reporters that Chechen opposition leaders
"are ready to make proper compromises for ending the war and wish
Moscow would hold a similar stand."
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have taken control of Bamut, the last stronghold
of the Chechen rebel fighters, which has held out for more than a
year, Russia's chief of staff General Mikhail Kolesnikov claimed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya declared itself independent in 1991, but Russia never
recognized this and sent in troops to crush the rebellion in
December 1994.

<HEADLINE> APEC Senior Officials' Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific region's economies
seek to build an APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation)
"community spirit" in efforts to translate a free trade dream into
reality, senior APEC officials said today at the close of a
four-day meeting in Cebu.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Federico Macaranas,
the meeting's chairman, said the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum's ambitious plan for a vast free trade area could only be
realized if member economies would succeed in obtaining the
support of businessmen and the region's population.
</P>
<P>
"The APEC community is more than inter-governmental," he said.
"It is more than business. It also includes civil society."
</P>
<P>
As a step toward building a form of "development cooperation,"
APEC needs to foster such cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"APEC is very diverse and the interests of some developing
member economies are precisely in the area of development
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Falling under this scheme are projects that aim to reduce
poverty, narrow down wide income gaps, increase the private
sector's role in the grouping's decision-making process, and
foster peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, all the 18 APEC members submitted
preliminary "individual action plans" for carrying out the
blueprint on free trade.
</P>
<P>
The members promised to submit "improved and revised"
"individual action plans" by the time APEC trade ministers meet in
Christchurch, New Zealand, in July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grouping also nominated representatives to the
APEC Business Advisory Council, a group of business leaders tasked
to advise APEC economic leaders.
</P>
<P>
It agreed to participate in the APEC business forum, a
gathering of business leaders to discuss a wide range of topics.

HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven more government
departments, which have extensive contacts with the public, have
joined a pilot scheme to promote the wider use of Chinese in their
daily work, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner for Official Languages Yvonne Choi said that this
would bring to nine the total number of departments joining the
pilot scheme.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the pilot scheme is one of the measures
recommended last September by the Working Group on the Use of
Chinese in the Civil Service.
</P>
<P>
"Their participation in the scheme will offer a most valuable
field from which the rest of the civil service can obtain
practical experience in the use of Chinese," Choi said.
</P>
<P>
She added that in order to assist civil servants in preparing
documents in Chinese, the Official Languages Agency has produced
the first batch of reference materials and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"This first batch focuses on general principles on official
Chinese writing, official correspondence and recommended

<HEADLINE> HK Service Industries Help Stabilize Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Fast-growing service industries
would help reduce economic fluctuations in Hong Kong and lead to a
 broader income range for the working population, according to the
 latest issue of Hang Seng Economic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Hong Kong has firmly established itself as
 a service center with the sector contributing to over 80 percent
of GDP (gross domestic product) and employing more than 78 percent
 of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
It said that underpinned by rapid economic growth in China and
other nations in the Asia-Pacific region, the service sector would
 continue to be a major source of output and employment growth in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's service sector focuses on a diverse range of
industries such as banking, transport, insurance, retail trade and
 personal services. The sector had the highest growth rate in the
world from 1980 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
China's increasing participation in international trade and
investment will reinforce Hong Kong's role as an enterpot and the
demand for trade-related services will increase. The territory
will also continue to play an important role as a major
fund-raising center to finance developments in China and the
region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out that to maintain the sector's
competitiveness, efforts are needed to overcome capacity
constraints and to improve labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's related department has generated a framework of
action to improve the productivity of the service sector and
expand the territory's service industries in overseas markets, so
as to ensure Hong Kong's continued success as a major global and
regional service center, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Holds Talks with Mubarak in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi held
talks here today with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
bilateral relations and a number of regional and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to deal with the latest developments in
the Middle East and the U.S. allegation that Libya is building a
nuclear weapon plant, according to Cairo press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has alleged that Libya is building the plant into a
mountain at Tarhunah, 65 kilometers southeast of Tripoli. Gaddafi
has categorically denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who arrived in Cairo today, had traveled to Egypt by
land because of a four-year-old U.N. ban on air travel in or out
of Libya.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to comply with a Western
demand for extraditing two Libyan nationals, who were suspected of
bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. A total of 270 people were killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, accompanied by a number of ministers, arrived in the
Egyptian border city of Salloum near the Libyan border Friday and
was greeted by Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif and
thousands of cheering people.
</P>
<P>
From Salloum, he drove to the Mediterranean port of Mersa
Matruh, about 200 kilometers from the Libyan border and left late
Friday for Cairo. He spend the night on the way.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi chose to drive all the way to Cairo despite an Egyptian
airport near the border.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who met with leaders of Awlad Ali, a tribe from the
Western Sahara, in Mersa Matruh Friday, would discuss with Mubarak
the building of a railway linking the Egyptian border town of
Salloum with the Libyan city of Tobruk, some 110 kilometers west
of the Libyan-Egyptian border.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss extending a pipeline from Libya to
Egypt's second largest city of Alexandria, local press said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi last visited Egypt in January, when he held talks with
Mubarak at a military base at Sidi Barrani, some 80 kilometers
east of the Egyptian-Libyan border.

MACAO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A set of advanced landing-aide
equipment has been put in use at the Macao International Airport
to help planes land in bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Cheng Pou reported today that the new
equipment will offer much convenience in landing and improve
safety.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that without the equipment, a pilot needed to
locate the airport in a distance of 800 meters and 66 meters above
 the airport, but the new equipment helps reduce those distance to
 350 meters and 37 meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Macao is the first one to use such a
system in south China, and is expected to offer help to airports
in neighboring regions when bad weather conditions occur.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urges Iraq to Implement All UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said Iraq must implement
all U.N. resolutions and protested against suggestions made by
World Health Organization (WHO) officials on lifting the embargo
against Iraq following the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food agreement,
according to local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers carried reports in their front pages quoting
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah as saying in London Friday that Iraq now
should implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions
related to its aggression against Kuwait, especially the release
of the detained Kuwaitis and the return of the looted Kuwaiti
properties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspapers quoted Kuwaiti Health Minister Abdul
Rahman Salem Mohailan as saying that Kuwait "protested in the
strongest possible terms to the director-general, Hiraoshi
Nakajima, about a report on the health situation in Iraq" and
dismissed the suggestion as beyond the limits of WHO's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Mohailan said in Geneva that the Iraqi government's statistics
on which the report was based "was not a reliable source of
information."
</P>
<P>
He noted that food and medicine have always been exempted from
the embargo and the sufferings of the Iraqi people have been a
result of it's leadership's non-compliance with United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Iraq agreed on implementing
U.N. resolution 986 Sunday which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of crude oil over six months on the world
market. Iraq will use part of the the proceeds to purchase food
and medicine to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people who
have been struggling under tough living conditions caused by the
embargo the U.N. imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister al-Sabah, on behalf of the Kuwaiti
government, welcomed the signing of the agreement Monday.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Survives Confidence Vote at Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
and his newly-elected center-left government survived a confidence
vote in the Senate today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi and his cabinet, of the so-called Olive Tree coalition,
won by 173 votes to 139 with one abstention at the upper house of
the Italian parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old former economic professor defeated former prime
minister Silvio Berlusconi, of the center-right Freedom Alliance,
in the April 21 general election.
</P>
<P>
The confidence vote was the first test for the new government,
which was sworn in last Saturday. "I am very satisfied," Prodi
told reporters after the vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the government still faces a similar vote in the
630-member Chamber of Deputies, or the lower house of the
parliament, next Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his speech at the Senate today, Prodi expressed the hope
that he could hold the premiership for a full term. "Five years
of work await us. I ask you the help me not to waste this great
historic opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were referring to the fact that the average life of
Italian governments since World War II has been less than one
year.
</P>
<P>
The Olive Tree coalition is dominated by the ex-communist
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). Its victory in the election
brought the left into the government for the first time in nearly
50 years.
</P>
<P>
Among Prodi's priorities for running the office are a federal
reform drive to modernizing Italy's centralized system of
government and public administration, and spending cuts to reduce
the country's huge budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he would try to meet the criteria
for Italian membership of a planned single European Union
currency before early 1998.

<HEADLINE> Mediterranean Countries Seek New Ways of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Mediterranean countries are
making efforts to fight regional pollution by using polymer
technology, according to a report of Weizmann Institute of
Science.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of scientists from the Mediterranean region and
elsewhere in the world met in Israel last week to exchange views
and experiences on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first international attempt to tackle the
pressing pollution problems in the area on a regional basis
through the use of polymer technology, provided the scientists
with a chance to foster joint efforts in approaching environmental
issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that polymers can be used to clean up the
environment because these giant carbon-containing molecules are
hollow in structure and can therefore absorb various
pollutions. On the other hand, because many polymers, such as
plastics and nylons, are not biodegradable, they constitute a
major environmental problem. Ways of reducing pollution caused by
these materials were also discussed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the specific topics discussed during the session on
polymers included filtering pollutants out of drinking water with
the help of polymeric membranes; extracting toxic metals, such as
mercury and zinc, from the sea off the coasts; developing
biodegradable plastics as a possible approach to reducing the
amounts of solid waste and reducing pesticide use thanks to
transparent polyethylene sheets that eradicate pests in the soil
by harnessing solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
While the Mediterranean region was a major focus, many of the
approaches are relevant to other parts of the world.

However, he said the reported agreement could not be officially
confirmed either as his office is still trying to contact its
headquarters to discuss the latest development.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Rabbani and Hekmatyar signed an agreement
on Friday near the Afghan capital of Kabul, which calls for
cessation of hostilities and restoration of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Hekmatyar's troops had joined the
government forces to defend Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Gul Zai said Rabbani and Hekmatyar had been engaged in talks
over the past few months and a "good understanding" had been
reached on policies in a number of fields.
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting of the Supreme Coordination Council of
Islamic Revolutionary Afghanistan (SCCIRA) is being held in the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif to discuss negotiations
between Rabbani and Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
The SCCIRA, a four-party opposition alliance including
Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group), has been reportedly pursuing a
united policy regarding any agreement with Rabbani.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A 10 percent growth in oil
consumption is reported in Uganda, leading a 6.5 percent growth
in gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The local daily "The New Vision" said today that the east
African country's GDP has grown at an annual rate of 6.5 percent
since the launching of the economic recovery program in May 1987.
</P>
<P>
A country's fuel consumption corresponds closely to economic
growth, suggesting that Uganda's economy will continue to grow
for some time to come, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's annual fuel consumption of 350,000 tons, however, is
still very small and wouldn't warrant heavy investment in
refinery plants, the daily quoted leading business sources as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's DYP Decides to Withdraw Support from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's coalition partner True
Path Party (DYP) decided to withdraw its support from the
coalition government with the Motherland Party (ANAP) and asked
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to render his resignation to the
Turkish president.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the semi-official Anatolia news agency
here this morning, the DYP made the decision at a meeting of the
DYP executive committee late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, DYP Deputy Chairman Ismail Kose told
reporters that "It is necessary for Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
to submit his resignation to President Suleyman Demirel".
</P>
<P>
On Friday, DYP Chairwoman Tansu Ciller announced the end
of the three-month-old coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's statement came from Madrid where she was attending a
conference on the subject of "Europe's Future".
</P>
<P>
She reiterated her views about her partner Yilmaz, saying his
government is finished both "legally and practically."
</P>
<P>
Ciller accused Yilmaz of ignoring the decision of the
Constitution Court annulling the vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, the court upheld an appeal by the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP), which argued that the vote of confidence in
March was against the procedure code of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government set up by the ANAP and the DYP won
257 and 207 votes respectively in addition to 80 abstentions, thereby
failing to gain an absolute majority, as stipulated in the
procedure code of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Economic Summit Ends With Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The three-day 1996 southern
african economic summit ended yesterday in Cape Town with
political and business leaders calling for greater regional
cooperation and increased efforts to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was organized jointly by the Geneva-based
World Economic Forum and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), was attended by SADC's political leaders and
more than 400 senior businessmen from around the world.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's "The Citizen" daily today quoted the organizers
as saying that concrete progress towards reducing trade
restrictions had been made at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session, South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki said: "We have to manage a very sensitive
relationship in the region, taking into account the realities of
South Africa's dominance."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said a trade
protocol within the SADC could be expected in August.
</P>
<P>
Referring to "an academic fear" that South Africa might
overrun industries in neighbouring countries, Mbuende said the
cost of non-integration was higher than that of integration.
</P>
<P>
The existing trade imbalances between South Africa and its
neighbours were criticized by some SADC member states. Zimbabwe
warned at the summit that it would formulate policies to protect
its industries if the problem remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
However, delegates at the summit formulated broad
recommendations for the region, including cautious privatization
of state assets, the liberalization of exchange controls, and the
need for free trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is clear evidence thast visions would be now be
translated into action, Said Neal Chapman, Chairman of South
Africa's Southern Life Association.
</P>
<P>
Next year's summit is scheduled to take place in Harare,
Zimbabwe.

prize-awarding ceremony that five TV films and six documentary
films, all award winners, will be shown in mid-June on CCTV and
BTV (Beijing Television).

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Help Blacks Enter Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government plans to
facilitate funding for black participation in all sectors of the
tourism industry, one of the fastest-growing industries in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Environment and Tourism Chen Chimutengwende said
on Friday in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, that
the government is requiring the redressing of the acute imbalance
in terms of business ownership between the black majority and
white minority.
</P>
<P>
He noted that of the 436 operators in the tourism industry
countrywide, only 38 were indigenous and of these, only 25 were
registered with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"In all sub-sectors, the majority of blacks appear to be
employed as guides, drivers, mechanics, teachers, cooks, stewards
who do not figure highly in the management and ownership," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government will endeavour to identify sources of funding
for the black participation "and my ministry would certainly
guarantee its implementation," according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Last year tourism earned the country more than 100 million
U.S. Dollars, or four percent of the year's gross domestic
product.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Demands Israel's Withdrawal from South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz has reiterated his country's demand for an Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon in exchange for security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated the demand in an interview with
Beirut's Safir Daily, which carried a story on the interview
today.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Boueiz stressed that U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 425 and 426 are "the best mechanism for achieving the
firm and rooted security in the South since they are based on the
 equality of exchanging the Israeli withdrawal for the security
and stability."
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure from Bonn to Paris Friday to continue his
European tour, the Lebanese foreign minister described a
cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on
April 26 as a "temporary transitional phase."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-mediated understanding put an end to 16 days of
Israeli military strikes in south Lebanon, in which some 200
civilians were killed and four hundred others wounded.
</P>
<P>
"It was necessary to pass through a temporary transitional
phase aimed at curbing the situation of security in the
South" in order to protect civilians from military attacks,
Boueiz pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the mechanism of monitoring the cease-fire
in south Lebanon, which is derived from the April understanding,
"should be military, not political."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister disclosed that a U.S. attempt to set up a
political mechanism had been thwarted during meetings of
representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon
and Syria, which started in Washington on May 10.
</P>
<P>
"After so many negotiations to define the mechanism of
work for the (cease-fire) monitoring committee, we have agreed
that Naqura would be the place of meetings, the mechanism
would be military, and the chairmanhood would be rotated
between the United States and France," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has suggested the term of the chairmanhood
be six months, when we believe that a quick rotation in the
chairmanship is better."
</P>
<P>
Without specifying the names, he accused "some" of attempting
to utilize the monitoring committee in favor of Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in the next Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
"But Lebanon sees that the committee should be forged in
the best way serving the (April) understanding," he added.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from the five states are scheduled to
resume their meetings in Washington Tuesday to continue
their efforts to iron out the differences on the formation
of the monitoring committee, as stipulated in the cease-fire
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese press has expressed pessimism that the committee
could not be established before the Israeli elections are held
on May 29.

<HEADLINE> Mothers Call for Teaching Children for Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten women in the eastern Chinese
city of Ningbo have called on all mothers to bring up their
children for the nation's course.
</P>
<P>
In an open petition they wrote that "it is the families'
obligation to have their children well educated, and make them
useful for the nation".
</P>
<P>
The ten women, who have been given the title of "Best Mothers"
in their residential districts, also urged parents to improve
themselves and create a harmonious family atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
There has been a long tradition in China that parents regard
their children as not only family members, but the wealth of the
country. And moving stories have been told over the centuries on
mothers encouraging their sons and daughters to fight or even die
for the nation in war times.
</P>
<P>
City officials expressed the hope that all parents follow the
mothers' call and contribute to social advancement by bringing up
well-educated children useful for the country.

<HEADLINE> Former Albanian Leaders Receive Life, Death Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- An Albanian court today sentenced
former head of state Haxhi Lleshi and former deputy prime minister
Manush Myftiu to life imprisonment for alleged crimes against
humanity and political persecution while in power.
</P>
<P>
The court condemned three other former high-ranking officials
-- Supreme Court chairman Aranit Cela, prosecutor-general Rrapi
Mino and deputy interior minister Zylyftar Ramizi -- to death on
the same charges.
</P>
<P>
The court tried the five under an anti-persecution law forced
through parliament by the government late last year. The
contentious law stipulates that all officials of Albania's former
communist government who oppressed Albanian citizens for political
or religious reasons should be punished.
</P>
<P>
The law, which has provoked fierce protests from opposition
parties, also bans former communist officials from running for
political office or for positions in the judiciary and the media
until 2002.
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling, which came two days ahead of Albania's
third multi-party elections, was the most severe against former
communist government officials since the opposition Democratic

<HEADLINE> Russian Navy Can Use Ukraine Base, With Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian navy may be stationed at
the Ukrainian naval base of Sevastopol and may use its facilities
under certain conditions and during certain periods, Ukrainian
Prime Minister Evgeni Marchuk said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ukrainian constitution, Sevastopol is a municipality
directly under the central government and also a glorious Crimean
city belonging to the Ukrainian, Russian and Belarussian peoples,
Marchuk told reporters in Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
But settling differences over the division of the Black Sea
Fleet, which is based in Sevastopol, was not an easy task, the
prime minister added after meeting commanders of the Ukrainian
Navy.
</P>
<P>
The fleet of 54 warships and other support vessels is to be
divided between Russia and Ukraine, but disputes have arisen over
Russia's demand to base its part of the fleet in Sevastopol and
for Ukraine to move its navy to nearby ports.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Marchuk and Russian Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin, who visited Ukraine yesterday, reportedly had a long
discussion about the Black Sea Fleet. Both said they were
satisfied with the talks but disclosed no details.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP to Up 10.4 Percent in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP) of
the country is predicted to increase by 10.4 percent in the first
six months this year over the same period of 1995, according to
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the commission were quoted by today's "Shanghai
Securities News" as saying that total investment in fixed assets
will grow by 19.2 percent, and the retail price index will go up
by around 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the increase in short-term loans of banks
and other financial organizations is expected to promote
industrial production in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the operation of newly-approved investment
projects, exports will gradually edge up starting from the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Considering the ratio of supply and demand, the economic
increase rate in the second quarter will be higher than the first
quarter, with the national GDP rising by 10.4 percent and total
industrial output value up by 16.2 percent, the sources were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets in the second quarter will be 20.5
percent higher than that of the first quarter, and the figure for
the first six months is predicted to increase by 19.2 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Residents' consumption in the second quarter will continue to
increase markedly in the second quarter as in the first three
months, as a result of rapid increase in bank savings and a strong
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The total social retail sales in the first six months is
expected to reach 1,140 billion yuan, up by 21.3 percent, or an
actual increase of 12.3 percent with the price factor deducted,
the sources predicted.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate of retail prices will be around 8 percent and
that of the national consumer price index about 10 percent,
according to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
Total exports and imports in the January-June period are
predicted to reach 66 billion US dollars respectively, striking a
balance in general.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Inflation, Deficit Rise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation and the
current account deficit rose in the first quarter of this year,
but the economy slowed down as expected.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was 7.4 percent and the current account deficit was
81 billion baht (3.24 billion US dollars), up 31.6 percent from
the same period last year, according to the National Economic and
Social Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The economy is unlikely to grow by more than 8.5 percent this
year, a review of the economy for the first quarter by the board
said.
</P>
<P>
The higher-than-expected inflation in the first quarter may
result in a rate of at least 5.5 percent for the whole year, up
from the previous forecast of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The current account, after an adjustment based on
newly-released figures from the Bank of Thailand, is expected to
be 7.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, down
from 8.1 percent of GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production index increased by 8.8 percent compared
with 17.6 percent during the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in production was caused by the nationwide flood
last year, which interrupted distribution and left adequate stocks
of commodities.
</P>
<P>
And exports in the quarter registered 11.6 percent growth,
against 28.2 percent in the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
For the quarter, there was a reduction in exports of frozen
shrimps, textiles and apparel, shoes, and canned seafood.
</P>
<P>
However, exports continued to expand in computers and parts,
integrated circuits, sugar, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports grew by 13.7 percent compared with 33.8
percent in the corresponding quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Total trade deficit in the quarter was 107 billion baht (4.28
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the current account deficit to 7.8 percent of
GDP this year stems from a slowdown of the economy, the weaker yen
which will reduce the cost of capital imports, and the declining
price of oil on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The board said inflation and the current account deficit will
continue to remain the main concerns.
</P>
<P>
The board also recommended that monetary policy should aim at
controlling domestic spending so that economic growth will not
exceed 8.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
It called for reduction of cost of agricultural production,
including reducing the high price of animal feed.
</P>
<P>
It also requested reducing tariffs on luxury goods to encourage
Thais to shop at home and develop the country into a regional
shopping center, although this may cause a surge in imports of
goods in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The board also proposed encouragement of Thais to travel within
the country instead of going abroad, through public relations
campaigns, and establishing domestic tourism businesses with
attractive incentives for Thai tourists.
</P>
<P>
The short-term effects of an expected world economic growth
this year on Thai economy will be a slowdown of exports, the board
said.
</P>
<P>
With lower interest rates worldwide, the country's high
inflation rate and current account deficit will fuel high domestic
interest rates, thus encouraging an inflow of capital for interest
rate speculation, the board believed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Reopen Kabul Embassy Unless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KARACHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar
Aseff Ahmed Ali said here Friday that Pakistan would not reopen
its mission in Kabul unless the compensation was paid for the
ransacking of its embassy.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters, the foreign minister said, "we are
not going to reopen our diplomatic mission unless Rabbani
compensates the losses."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani embassy in the Afghan capital of Kabul was
ransacked and burnt down by a group of mob on September 6 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government blamed the government of Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani for failing to protect the embassy
and demanded a full compensation and an apology for the attack.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan government delegation, first of its kind in eight
months since the attack on the Pakistani embassy and the severance
of Pak-Afghan diplomatic ties, visited Islamabad early this month.
</P>
<P>
The delegation agreed in principle with Pakistan's demand. But
no detailed compensation has been worked out.
</P>
<P>
On the recently reported power-sharing agreement between
Rabbani and his arch rival Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the foreign
minister welcomed the reconciliation between the two main
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would support any move initiated for
peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan welcome each and every development for restoration of
a peaceful atmosphere in that country," said Aseff.

<HEADLINE> Preferential Treatment for 100 State Enterprises in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in northeast
China has selected 100 large and medium-sized state enterprises
for a trial effort at gradual overall improvement.
</P>
<P>
They are mainly involved in machinery, chemicals, metallurgy,
and light industry, in the cities of Shenyang and Dalian.
</P>
<P>
The businesses, with a total assets of 21.9 billion yuan in
1995, accounted for 6.17 percent of all the province's state-owned
enterprises. About 80 percent of the enterprises are lacking in
funds.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say that measures to be taken include providing
more investment for refurbishing the enterprises, implementing the
share-holding system, and returning more tax funds.
</P>
<P>
The province has set a goal of noticeably improving two-thirds
of its state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises by the turn
of the century, and will select 100 of them for overall upgrading
every year, the authorities say.

<HEADLINE> India's Samata Party Not to Support Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) has suffered a major blow to its efforts to survive a coming
vote of confidence in its minority government when one of its
major allies, the Samata Party, withdrew support to it, the
Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Samata Secretary General Om Prakash Chautala said in Chandigarh
on Friday that his party would not support the BJP in the vote of
confidence motion in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament)
scheduled for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the BJP government would not be able to
survive the vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Samata Party's senior official also said his party was
opposed to newspapers and televisions carrying the name of the
Samata party as an ally of the BJP.
</P>
<P>
The Samata Party, which won eight parliamentary seats in the
general elections, has been widely believed to be the second
largest ally of the ruling BJP. But the party did not join the
BJP coalition government which was formed on May 16.
</P>
<P>
The Samata Party's withdrawal of support will reduce the BJP
and its allies' total tally of seats to less than 190, far short
of a 269-seat simple majority needed to survive the vote of
confidence.

<HEADLINE> Over 50,000 Children Missing in Canada Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of missing children
reported to police across Canada increased to 55,749 in 1995 from
51,973 in 1994, said an annual report by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP).
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the children resulted from "parental or
stranger abductions, accidents, or other mishaps", and 78 percent
of them are runaways, said the RCMP report.
</P>
<P>
Of the new cases added to the Canadian Police Information
Center database last year, 93 percent were between the age of 12

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee has insisted that his party would face the trial of
strength in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) and there
was no question of his government resigning before it, the
National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after an hour-long parliamentary party
meeting of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday,
Vajpayee ruled out his resignation before the vote of confidence
takes place.
</P>
<P>
The situation, he said, was fluid and almost all political
parties, except those with one member of parliament each, were
assessing the changing political scenario.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, meanwhile, has issued a three-line whip, directing all
its members to be present in the House from Monday onwards.
</P>
<P>
Voting on the confidence motion proposed by the BJP-minority
coalition is scheduled for next Tuesday. But the BJP is still
trying to persuade the Lok Sabha speaker to postpone the voting
until May 30.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Govt., Hezb-i-Islami Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- An agreement has been signed
between the Afghan government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani
and its rival Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar group) on re-entering an
alliance, local press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Radio Kabul as saying that the six-point
agreement was signed on Friday at a town named Mahipar, about 35
kilometers east of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's military strongman Ahmad Shah Masood and his ally
Rasool Sayaf, leader of Ittehad-i-Islami, were present during the
signing ceremony, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Talking with Xinhua by telephone, an official from the
Hezb-i-Islami office in Islamabad, who refused to give his name,
said he could not deny the local press reports.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to give further comments on the latest
developments.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for cessation of hostilities and
restoration of peace and stability in the country, establishment
of an Islamic government, formation of an interim administration,
holding elections, setting up a national Islamic army and
upholding Afghanistan's sovereignty and unity.
</P>
<P>
The agreement did not say whether there are joint military
operations against Rabbani's arch rival Taliban Militia whose
heavy forces are stationed just outside Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman said on Friday
that Hezb fighters had already been involved in fighting against
the Taliban southeast of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted some sources in Kabul as saying that the
Hezb-i-Islami would be given the posts of prime minister, minister
of defense and minister of finance in the newly broadened
administration.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani and his allies would retain the offices of president,
interior and national security minister and foreign minister, they
added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed after a series of negotiations between
the two former rivals during the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, former Prime Minister of Rabbani's regime, split
away from the government on January 1, 1994, when he and Uzbek
General Rashid Dostum unleashed an abortive military coup.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Slams U.S. Human Rights Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday blasted Washington over its human
rights record and urged it to stop meddling in other countries'
internal affairs as a self-appointed "human rights judge."
</P>
<P>
A large number of working people, who form the majority of the
U.S. population, are denied the protection of the state and the
law and excluded from the country's political and economic life,
said an article published by the DPRK's official daily newspaper
Minju Choson (Democratic Korea).
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "Human Rights In The United States -- A
Self-styled Human Rights Judge", said large numbers of Americans,
especially women, blacks and Indians, are prevented from taking
part in such vital political activities as elections because their
right to vote has been made nominal by many restrictions imposed
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The article said the U.S. Congress is monopolized by a minority
of rich men, adding that in April 1994, 30 members of the 100-seat
Senate and 50 members of its 435-seat House of Representatives
were millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it added, the so-called "parliamentary democracy"
advocated by the United States has been reduced to outright
democracy for a small number of millionares.
</P>
<P>
The article said the U.S. Constitution falls short of
stipulating not only equality between ethnic groups, men and
women, and citizens, but also citizens' basic rights and right to
survival.
</P>
<P>
It also rapped the U.S. government for its failure to protect
women's rights, saying the wages American women earn for the same
work is generally about 59 percent of men's, but their
unemployment rate is more than double.
</P>
<P>
Rampant crime further mirrored the human rights record in the
United States, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article, citing figures released by the U.S. government,
said the number of inmates in the U.S. prisons had hit a
staggering 5.19 million by the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said, up to six million Americans are victims
of violent crime annually and 24,000 Americans are murdered
annually.
</P>
<P>
The article emphasized that the United States should first
improve its own human rights record instead of interfering in
other countries' internal matters by creating disturbances over
human rights on groundless charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- An international panel monitoring
implementation of the Dayton peace accord met here today to
discuss Bosnia's reconstruction, the repatriation of refugees and
procedures for elections due to be held in September.
</P>
<P>
Peace coordinator Carl Bildt presided over the meeting
attended by representatives of the Bosnia Contact Group --the
United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany -- member
countries of the Islamic Conference, Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said
the international community may reconsider its commitment to
bringing peace to Bosnia unless all the parties there fulfilled
the pledges they had made under the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the time had come for attention to be
shifted from the military phase to cooperation between the
factions themselves as well as between the factions and the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Representatives at the meeting said elections must be held
within the peace agreement's timetable because they were essential
to setting up the required civilian institutions there.
</P>
<P>
The panel also discussed arrangements to be made following the
withdrawal of NATO peacekeeping troops from Bosnia by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Bildt called on international community to increase pressure for
the removal of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic from political
life. Karadzic's continuation in power has obstructed the
implementation of the Dayton agreement.

MANAGUA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaragua Interoceanic Canal
Consortium (CINN) is urging the government to proceed with plans
to build a railway across the country to connect the Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans to relieve cargo transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
A government commission has been holding discussions on the
construction of the interoceanic railway and agreements were

The commission opened the railway project to bids by
international consortia in February this year. Eight multinational
companies have shown interest.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the interoceanic railway, which would be an
alternative to the Panama Canal, would cost 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars and take three to five years, said the CINN source.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Won't Cancel Accord with Israel: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Oltan
Sungurlu today denied recent media speculation that Turkey may
cancel its controversial military accord with Israel due to
increasing pressure from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"Many questions were asked on this subject ... I said this
could be done legally but this was not an issue on the agenda,"
Sungurlu told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a military cooperation agreement on
February 23 in Tel Aviv, allowing either country's unarmed
warplanes to use the other's airspace for training.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which gives Israel much-needed additional
area for military training, led to angry reactions both from
Islamic circles at home and from the Arab world, especially Iran,
Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Sungurlu also denied that the accord foresaw joint military
maneuvers between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israel daily Ha'aretz reported earlier that the
Turkish-Israeli accord would allow eight joint military exercises
each year.
</P>
<P>
Sungurlu, asked about a four-day visit to Israel of Turkish
Admiral Guven Erkaya earlier this week, said it was just a
"fact-finding" visit.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Erkaya held talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres. Reports said their discussions focused on ways to
further develop defense cooperation between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Says Nearly 20,000 Servicemen, Chechen Rebels Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The 17-month conflict in Chechnya
has killed 2,483 Russian servicemen and 16,843 separatist
fighters, a spokesman for the General Staff of Russia's Armed
Forces said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest casualties were 25 Russian soldiers and 350 Chechen
guerrillas killed in the first three days of an offensive by
Russian troops to seize Bamut, a rebel bastion southwest of the
Chechen capital Grozny, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov told the
State Duma (lower house of parliament) that Russian troops had
captured Bamut, one of the few remaining rebel strongholds, today,
after five days of bitter fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kolesnikov claimed that all Chechen combatants in Bamut had
been killed or captured but failed to give precise numbers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said other Russian losses during the conflict
included 80 tanks, 729 armored vehicles, 93 rocket guns, four jet
fighters, 18 helicopters and 420 motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
He said the losses on the Chechen side were far greater but did
not give details.
</P>
<P>
He added that the morale of Chechen fighters, who have resorted
to guerrilla warfare in the mountains after being driven out of
most Chechen cities, had declined dramatically in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The conflict broke out in December 1994 after Russian President
Boris Yeltsin sent troops and tanks to end Chechen separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's independence bid.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has claimed nearly 30,000 lives, including Chechen
civilians, and uprooted tens of thousands of Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
The unpopular war has become a major obstacle to the Yeltsin's
re-election bid in presidential polls next month.
</P>
<P>
In the latest move to resolve the crisis, he has persuaded new
rebel chief Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev to hold face-to-face talks in
Moscow as soon as possible. Yandarbiyev took over late last month
from Dudayev who was killed not long ago by a Russian missile
attack.

MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin will
visit Ukraine before the June 16 presidential election, Russian
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A detailed itinerary will be decided by Yeltsin's schedule and
consultations between Yeltsin and Ukrainian president Leonid
Kuchma, Chernomyrdin told reporters today after returning to
Moscow from a one-day visit to Ukraine on Thursday.
</P>

Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine has been put off several times. If
the visit goes ahead in the next few weeks, the two presidents
will sign a series of documents on bilateral relations which
Chernomyrdin said he had prepared with Ukrainian Prime Minister
Evgeni Marchuk.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said some differences still exist between the two
countries, especially over the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have been at odds in recent years due to
differences over the division of the Black Sea Fleet, debt
repayment and territory.

<HEADLINE> Tariffs Cut Boosts Imports of Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's reduced customs tariffs have
led to a big increase of imports in Jiangsu, an economic power in
east China.
</P>
<P>
Imports in Jiangsu surged 24.8 percent to 930 million US
dollars in the first four months of this year, according to
figures released by the provincial commission of foreign trade and
economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Import deliveries in April, when the new tariffs were
introduced, were valued at 420 million US dollars, 82 percent of
the imports of the previous three months put together.
</P>
<P>
As the customs tariff favored raw and scarce materials and
high-tech products, Jiangsu's import of steel, plastics,
electronic and machinery products, rubber, fertilizer and farm-use
plastic film showed a sharp rise, said a local trade official.
</P>
<P>
However, exports in the first four months recorded a sluggish
growth with the export value remaining at three billion US dollars,
the same as last year's first four months.

<HEADLINE> Central, East European Forum Calls For Reforms to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on economic reform in
central and eastern Europe ended here today with a declaration
calling on countries in the region to continue reforms in line
with their specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians and ministers from the 39 member states of the
Council of Europe, and representatives from international
organizations, employers, trade unions and advisory bodies
attended the symposium from May 22 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Declaration said that the fruits of economic reforms
should be shared equitably among citizens and adequate funds must
be allocated to protecting public health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Rapid progress in most central and east European countries
during six years of successful reforms had laid the foundations
for social democracy and stability, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It called on central and east European countries to protect the
weak in society so that they would not lose faith in reform and
democracy following years of deprivation during the transition
period.
</P>
<P>
Social stability should not be ignored during the process of
economic reform, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Governments should encourage the development of small and
medium-sized enterprises and promote the development of
agriculture, it added.
</P>
<P>
This was the third symposium organized by the Council of Europe
since 1990. The first was held in Budapest, Hungary, in 1980 and
the second in Helsinki, Finland, in 1993.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Vows to Bring Serb War Criminals to Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said here today that no deals will be made to spare Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and army commander General Ratko Mladic
from prosecution for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Solana's remarks were apparently in response to reports that
the two Bosnian Serb leaders could be exempted from trials at the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague if they disappear
from public life.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said after attending a seminar here that NATO
troops in Bosnia have clear orders to arrest war criminals in
accordance with the Dayton peace treaty, which was signed last
November to end the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted by the tribunal for
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said Thursday that international arrest
warrants would be issued against indicted Serb war criminals if
there was enough evidence.
</P>
<P>
"If evidence supports allegations in the indictments," then
warrants would be issued for their arrest, U.N. spokeswoman in
Belgrade Susan Manuel told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
She said prosecutors at the tribunal will start presenting
evidence against the two Serb leaders next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Tribunal President Antonio Cassese has addressed a letter to
the U.N. Security Council which contains facts so as to exert
pressure and obtain the arrest of Karadzic and Mladic," Manuel
said.
</P>
<P>
International pressure has been mounting recently to force the
two indicted Serb leaders to step down and be extradited to The
Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic and Mladic remain in top posts although they should
have been removed under the Dayton peace agreement which also bans
them from standing in elections due to be held in Bosnia in
September.
</P>
<P>
So far, 54 Bosnians have been indicted by the tribunal, 47 of
whom are Serbs and the rest Croats and Muslims.

<HEADLINE> China Successful in Supervising Snow Storms with Hi-tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Satellites used with the functions
of remote-sensing to enable experts to warn against violent
snowstorms in China have helped reduce economic losses by up to 20
percent in the country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The special forecasts beam from the sky has helped scientists
to avert snow disasters by giving early warnings so that accurate
supervision and evaluation can take place.
</P>
<P>
Snow storms are frequent in the pastoral areas of north and
west China, where major snow storms are capable of killing half of
the cattle. Direct economic losses caused by snow storms in China
are estimated at several hundred million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To fight snow storms, the Chinese government listed the
supervision and evaluation of snow disasters with remote-sensing
technology as a key research program.
</P>
<P>
After five years of research, scientists of the Lanzhou
Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology, under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, have set up a system in which satellite
remote-sensing technology and geographic information systems are
adopted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the achievement was successfully used in Nagqu in
Tibet Autonomous Region, providing early information for decision
makers.
</P>
<P>
Local government has signed an agreement of co-operation with
the institute. Under the agreement, remote-sensing technology will
be utilized to supervise possible snow storms in Nagqu between
June this year and May next year.
</P>
<P>
The achievement will be able to help avoid 30-40 million yuan
worth of economic losses annually if it is put to use in the
pastoral areas around the country, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Industry Puffed Out As Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's cigarette industry appears
to be losing its puff for the first time ever, with sales and
production falling in the first four months of this year, the
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide anti-smoking campaigns and rising production costs
have taken their toll on the industry, which fuels the habits of
over 300 million smokers.
</P>
<P>
The industry, boasting nearly 180 cigarette factories, churned
out 56.66 million cigarettes in the first four months of this
year, an 1.7 per cent drop from 57.625 million in the same period
last year, according to the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau(STMB).
</P>
<P>
A total of 54.21 million cigarettes were sold, down 2.3 percent
from the 55.465 million sold last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a normal situation, because usually cigarettes see
brisk sales prior to the Spring Festival. More often than not, the
sales drops markedly afterwards," an STMB official said.
</P>
<P>
"But the influence of the smoking ban in public places in 26
cities throughout the country cannot be ruled out," the official
added.
</P>
<P>
"Although we expect an upturn in the sales and production in
the second half of this year, the outlook is not rosy," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the national anti-smoking movements, STMB has
slashed its planned output to 1,712.5 billion cigarettes this
year, down from the actual production of 1,736 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
However, as one of the country's largest tax generators, the
industry turned in 25.5 billion yuan (three billion US dollars) in
profits and taxes, a marked 16 percent rise over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the rise in profits to the increased
production of famous-brand cigarettes and those with filter-tips,
which sell for a higher price.
</P>
<P>
Output of as many as 50 famous-brands has topped 17.34 million
over the first four months, accounting for 30 percent of total
volume, up 6.7 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, cost hikes in raw materials like tobacco, filter
tips, paper, and packaging as well as rise in prices of water and
electricity, has trimmed at least three billion yuan off the
expected revenue for the period," he said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Uses Technology to Promote Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The provinces of Qinghai, Gansu,
and Shaanxi and the Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Regions in northwest China are placing greater significance on
developing agricultural technology over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, in the northwestern part of China, plans a series of
key technical programs designed to produce 1,000 kilograms of
grain or 100 kilograms of cotton with one mu (0.06 hectares) of
land. Also, it aims to build several agricultural giants at
county and township levels.
</P>
<P>
The regional government also plans to speed up popularization
of agricultural technology and technical training among local
farmers and herdsmen, to turn the region into a large-scale cotton
production base and granary for northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province has focused on per unit grain production by
using technical achievements, especially new agricultural
technology, with more efforts put on raising the ratio of
technology-produced grain to over 50 percent, from the former 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has worked out plans to use 12 key agricultural
technical achievements for seeding of wheat and planting of rice
in different parts of the region, projecting improved seeds to
account for more than 90 percent of the region's grain, by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
The region, though rich in resources with great potentials,
lags behind other provinces and regions economically at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The five northwestern provinces and autonomous regions started
their respective agricultural-development-through-scientific
achievements projects five years ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the cities and counties and over 80
percent of the towns have set up centers to popularize science. In
addition, more than 50 percent of the villages have a deputy head
in charge of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Local governments also attach great importance to eliminating
illiteracy in science and technology among rural adults.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai provincial government, for example, has allocated
1.2 million yuan each year to acquaint more than 2.6 million
farmers with scientific and technological knowledge and technical
skills.
</P>
<P>
The government has established a responsibility system for
eliminating illiteracy and illiteracy rate among young people has
dropped to 15 percent, from 41 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
It has established more than 20,000 pilot households as
training bases, where 300,000 farmers and more than 1,000
agricultural technicians are trained each year.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 10,000 farmers' technical associations
in the northwest, which play a key role in agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, there were more than 2,000 scientific
and technological achievements made in forestry, animal husbandry,
fisheries and other areas, over 65 percent of which have been put
to use.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology have greatly improved the ability of the
localities to deal with disasters and helped increase grain output
by over 12 billion kilograms, and income of local farmers by more
than 16 billion yuan.

years old, and 20 of them are over 1,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
The oldest is a 28 m high Yunnan pine , which is said to be
1,800 years of age.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Seventy Percent of Beijing Farmers Shower at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Taking a shower after a day's work
used to be an extravagant hope for farmers, but now their dream
has come true.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's suburban Tongxian County the construction of
shower rooms at home has become the fashion. Solar heating boards
are seen shining on the roofs of many farm houses nowadays.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 70 percent of the county's 140,000 rural
households have built shower rooms, according to the "Beijing
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The county consists of 17 townships, but most of the towns and
villages are far away from the county town, which was the only
place in the county with public bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
It was hard for farmers to take a bath all the year round,
local people said. After a day's farming work, men sometimes
bathed in rivers, but women had to wash themselves with a basin of
water.
</P>
<P>
The booming of township enterprises over the past few years has
enabled farmers to become prosperous, and as a result they are
considering ways to raise the quality of their lives.
</P>
<P>
In addition to household shower rooms, all the county's 17
townships and towns have built public bathhouses.

<HEADLINE> New Bridge to Span Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A new expressway bridge over the
Yellow River will be built near this capital city of east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The 5,700-m-long and 35.5-m-wide concrete bridge will have six
two-way lanes, on which the designed speed limit will be 120 kph.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will be part of a new expressway between Jinan and
Dezhou, a traffic hub in northern Shandong. And it will be the
most expensive bridge over the Yellow River, since the whole
project is expected to cost about 700 million yuan (84.3 million
US dollars).

<HEADLINE> EU Administrator Confirms Postponing of Mostar Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union administrator in
Mostar, Ricardo Perez Casado, said on Friday that local elections
in the southwestern Bosnian city has been postponed until the
second half of June, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Casado confirmed at a press conference in Mostar that the Croat
and Moslem sides had reached an agreement to put off the elections
that had been scheduled for May 31.
</P>
<P>
But the specific date for the elections has yet to be worked
out, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The delay of the Mostar elections stemmed from Muslims's
complaint that the date previously chosen by EU would prevent
refugees abroad from participating in the elections. The Muslim
side has threatened to boycott the elections unless election rules
are changed.
</P>
<P>
Casado said that refugees from Mostar would be able to vote by
absentee ballot but said that it was yet to be determined how and
where they would vote.

<HEADLINE> British PM Visits Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British prime minister John Major
on Friday paid a one-day visit to Bosnia, including a stop at
Serbs-controlled city of Bania Luka, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Major
said that Britain wants to see the fulfillment of all obligations
under the Dayton peace agreement and attaches great importance to
the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic was quoted as saying that that he had warned Major
of the fact that negative elements of the Dayton peace agreement
were becoming more and more prominent, which "creates fear of
possible disintegration of the country among our people".
</P>
<P>
Major said that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and its
military commander Ratko Mladic, both indicted for war crimes,
should be sent to the Haigue international court, but he did
specify how this would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Nato-led Implementation Force (IFOR), of which Britain is a
member, has refused to go after Karadzic and Mladic for fear of
retaliation against its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Major visited British IFOR troops in
northwestern Bosnia and met with members of the local Serb
leadership in Banja Luka, whom are considered moderates compared
with hardliners such as Karadzic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Traded Higher Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged to the
highest level against the yen in more than a month Friday after a
senior Japanese Finance Ministry official doused widespread
expectations of higher interest rates in Japan.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar ended lower against the mark, which also derived
strength from a sell-off in yen. The dollar was mixed against other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m. in New York, the dollar traded at 107.80 yen, up from
106.93 yen Thursday and the highest level against the Japanese
currency since April 18. The dollar also traded at 1.5420 marks,
down from 1.5425 marks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eisuke Sakakibara, head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's
international finance bureau, made some remarks to a group of
Japanese business executives in Tokyo, which were viewed as
evidence that Japan's central bank won't soon raise rates in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said the dollar also drew support from a rally in
the U.S. bond market after the government reported weaker factory
orders for April, further evidence that U.S. economy isn't growing
at an inflationary pace.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researcher Finds Immune System's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian researcher has identified
a protein that "flips the switch" to shut down the T-cells, the
white blood cells that kill invaders.
</P>
<P>
The finding of the protein, known as SYP, opens the possibility
of developing drugs to help boost defenses against cancers or
AIDS, or to control autoimmune diseases such as lupus or diabetes,
according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
SYP is a type of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, and is
produced within the cell on orders from a molecule on the cell
surface.
</P>
<P>
"The switch molecule, CTLA-4. acts as the general, ordering the
proteins, which are like privates, to do the physical work of
halting activity in the cell when the immune defense is complete,"
the paper quoted the researcher, Dr. Luc Marengere of the Ontario
Cancer Institute, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown in the chain of command allows the immune cells to
remain potent attackers and begin to attack friendly cells. Attack
by uncontrolled T-cells is believed to be behind many autoimmune
diseases such as lupus, diabetes and rheumatiod arthritis, Dr.
Marengere said.
</P>
<P>
SYP is the first of the proteins to be identified and there may
be others with specific effects that moderate immune responses and
shut the cell off, he said.
</P>
<P>
A different kind of proteins acting on another receptor gives
the order to turn on, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we can develop therapeutics that make use of this to
manipulate the immune system," either encouraging the chain of
command or breaking it down. However, the treatments on humans are
likely to be several years away, he added.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Efforts to Combat Poverty Stressed at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Concerted national and
international action, more resources, debt relief and fair trade
practices were necessary to combat poverty, the Commission on
Social Development was told today.
</P>
<P>
When discussing strategies for poverty eradication at the
current session of the commission, representatives of developing
countries suggested preparing integrated strategies to meet basic
human needs and to ensure sustainable development. They also
stressed that the fight against poverty was a task for both the
developed and the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Yogesh Varhade of the Ambedkar Center for Justice and Peace
said that there were 560 million poor in south Asia. He stressed
the need for empowering those people, especially the
"untouchables" in India, and the fundamental rights to food,
health and education had to be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Sileshi Shewaneh of Ethiopia said that eradication of poverty
demanded concerted and united action. Intergrated strategies were
needed to meet basic human needs and to ensure sustainable
development. No part of the world was immune from poverty. The
shortage of resources, debt burden and the imbalance of trade
necessitated that action at the national level be complemented by
international action.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Lemarresquier, a representative of the United Nations
Development Program, said there was no one efficient way to fight
poverty without economic growth. If the fight against poverty was
a state's responsibility, it had to be recognized that the
globalization of the economy had a big impact on the development
of countries.
</P>
<P>
Amina Mesdou of Algeria said a true international partnership
was required to solve the problem of poverty. It was time for
structural adjustment to be given a second look. Algeria was
exposed to the instability in the international environment. It
was implementing economic reforms at considerable social cost.
Algeria needed international support to carry out its economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Kaba Camara of Cote d'Ivoire said that there was a need to
increase the flow of resources for poor countries to enable them
to implement programs to combat poverty. Urgent measures should be
taken to donor countries to implement measures recommended by the
Social Summit concerning the foreign debt problems. He also
complained fluctuations in commodity prices posed severe problems
for African states which depended on single crops.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Limjuco of Philippines said that development had to
include the enhancement of people's spiritual self while poverty
continued to exist with bounty. Strategies had to be designed to
be sustainable and to take into account the culture and psyche of
the people.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Jury Reach No Verdict Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Jurors in the Whitewater-related
trial Friday wound up a full week of deliberations without
reaching a verdict on Governor Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan
McDougal, President Bill Clinton's former business partners.
</P>
<P>
The jury weighing fraud and conspiracy charges against Tucker,
James McDougal and McDougal's ex-wife, Susan, in Little Rock,
Arkansas, returned today for a seventh day of deliberations but
were dismissed by the judge by lunchtime, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. decided to give jurors a
start on the three-day Memorial Day weekend. They are to return
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals, who were partners with then Gov. Bill and
Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater real estate development, and
Tucker are accused of conspiracy and fraud in obtaining 3 million
dollars in loans from two federally backed lenders during the
mid-1980s. Clinton gave videotaped testimony for the defense.

<HEADLINE> First Internet Bank Goes Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Investors embraced America's first
internet bank, the Security First Network Bank, with a high buying
volume, when it was listed on the stock exchange in New York
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Its shares more than doubled in price to 41 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank, starting from scratch, has been offering its services
on the Internet since October.
</P>
<P>
"Our business model has no branches," says Security First
President Michael Karlin in a letter on the bank's Internet site.
But it opens seven days a week, 24 hours a day, with the exception
that accounts filed in on Sundays will be handled the next day.
</P>
<P>
"Every day we received a huge amount of applications for
opening new accounts," said an official from the bank, declining
to reveal the exact number.
</P>
<P>
When a customer opens the bank's web site of
http://www.sfnb.com, he will first see on the screen a lobby like
an ordinary bank, with different counters dealing with "customer
service", "personal finance", "account setup" and an information
desk. The customer just point the arrow of the mouse to the desk
he wishes to reach and click and complete the task.
</P>
<P>
What makes bank more attractive is that it offers higher bank
rates and does not charge any fees for checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
"No bank art on the walls. No marble, bulletproof glass or
countless tellers and managers to ride herd over, and therefore,
significantly less overhead," Karlin says.
</P>
<P>
And that means the bank can pass the savings on to customers in
the form of low fees and high rates on certificates of deposit,
Karlin says,
</P>
<P>
A vital obstacle a bank has to overcome is to guarantee the
security of customers' accounts, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The customer's SFNB account is protected by a "military grade
operating system," said Karlin, adding that it is the same one
that protects sensitive information for defense and intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is fully insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDLC), generally up to 100,000 U.S. dollars
per depositor, per bank.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that doesn't necessarily make consumers feel
at ease. Traditional banks that add internet services have an
advantage because they are well-known and trusted institutions.
</P>
<P>
When a person opens his account, he sees first an account
summary. He can also jump off to many other points.
</P>
<P>
Quick pay is another useful feature of the banking system which
is used often to pay a bill. Still it is not an independent
system, the bank is linked with other major banks to allow people
to use an Automatic Tellering Machine (ATM) card or debt card on
the ATM machines on streets.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said these are not impediments to the future of
Internet banking. The bank raised 48.8 million U.S. dollars in its
initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen how quickly consumers will embrace
electronic commerce. "Will people choose a bank on the Internet
without being able to walk into the lobby once a year?" asked
Timothy Duncan, an expert on financial service on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Legal Challenge to EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government has formally
launched its legal challenge to the European Union's (EU) global
ban on British beef products exports, the BBC television reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The British government has earlier threatened to take the EU
beef ban to the European Court of Justice and the EU Veterinary
Committee's refusal to endorse an EU proposal of lifting the ban
on some British beef by-products has made Britain determined to
fight the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
A final ruling from Luxembourg could take a year or more, by
which time most people assume the ban will have been lifted in any
case, the BBC television report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain is calling for an interim ruling of lifting
the eight-week-old ban while the case is being considered.
</P>
<P>
The European Court's response to Britain's call for an interim
ruling lifting the ban may come in the next week or two, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say if the decision is in favor of the British
government, plenty of Europeans will find the situation very
ironic.
</P>
<P>
If the ban remains in place, the decision may add duel to the
British ruling Conservative Euro-sceptics, who are demanding to
obtain a clear EU timetable of lifting the beef ban.
</P>
<P>
The British government is undertaking a non-cooperation
campaign against the EU in a bid to get the world-wide ban on
British beef products exports lifted.
