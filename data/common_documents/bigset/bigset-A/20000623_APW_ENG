Texas Inmate Gary Graham Executed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Gary Graham, subject of the most contentious Texas
death penalty case since Gov. George W. Bush began running for president, was
executed Thursday night after putting up a struggle and insisting he was
innocent of a 1981 murder. Graham, 36, received a lethal injection for the
killing of a man in a holdup outside a Houston supermarket. The state parole
board and appeals courts rejected his arguments that he was convicted on shaky
evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a poor job. Bush
said he supported the execution and pointed out that Graham's case had been
reviewed by 33 state and federal judges.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel is prepared to give the Palestinians part of
Jerusalem and all of the strategic Jordan Valley, according to an American
document summing up the negotiations so far, Israel television reported
Thursday. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office dismissed the report as ''baseless
speculation.'' Larry Schwartz, the spokesman for the U.S. Embassy, said he has
seen the paper, but ''it is not an official American government document.''

Colorado Wildfires Nearly Contained
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Fires that burned 21,000 acres in Colorado's foothills were
close to being controlled Thursday, although crews continued to monitor hot
spots and watch for flare-ups. Firefighters also were on standby in Grand
Junction, Pueblo and Durango in case any new wildfires erupted. Thirty-nine of
Colorado's 63 counties had fire restrictions Thursday because of the dry
conditions that helped fuel the fires southwest of Denver and east of Rocky
Mountain National Park.

Gore Probe Is Urged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials Thursday confirmed that the most
recent prosecutor to question Al Gore about his 1996 fund raising is
recommending a special counsel investigate whether the vice president lied.
Thursday brought other menacing news for Democrats. Independent Counsel Robert
Ray reported ''substantial evidence'' Hillary Rodham Clinton played a role in
White House travel office firings, contrary to her denials, but said he would
not bring charges against her.

Prosecutor Cites Clinton Travel Role
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday that, despite
her denials, there is ''substantial evidence'' that Hillary Rodham Clinton
played a role in White House travel office firings, but the prosecutor said he
won't bring charges because there's not enough evidence to convict the first
lady. The announcement comes less than six months before the 2000 election. Mrs.
Clinton is seeking to become a U.S. senator from New York.

Senate Nixes Worker Protections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted tonight to block
proposed Clinton administration rules giving workers new protections against
repetitive motion injuries. The 57-41 vote was mostly along party lines, and
came several days after the House adopted a similar ban. Democrats said the
regulations developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration could
help an estimated 1.8 million workers who suffer from ergonomic injuries each
year. Republicans insisted that the new rules would cost businesses too much.

Congress Leaders OK Spending Pact

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate leaders broke a spending impasse
Thursday, agreeing to free $12 billion in long-delayed funds to help Colombia's
war on drugs, pay for U.S. troops in Kosovo and provide natural disaster relief.
The agreement came as the Senate voted 95-4 to endorse a $13.4 billion foreign
aid bill. The legislation contained just under $1 billion in anti-narcotics
assistance to Colombia. However, under the new agreement that amount will now be
increased to $1.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Intervenes on Patients Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert intervened
forcefully Thursday in negotiations on a long-stalled patients'
rights bill, joining in marathon talks aimed at uniting
congressional Republicans on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're making some progress,'' the Illinois Republican said as
negotiators took a brief break shortly before midnight. ''This is
hard work,'' he added of efforts to forge agreement on a bill to
strengthen the hand of patients in dealing with their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers met late into the night in the Capitol office of
Senate Republican Whip Don Nickles, who has played the lead role in
talks -- now suspended -- aimed at reaching agreement with Democrats
on the bill. They were joined for the first time by Rep. Charles
Norwood of Georgia, a rebel on the issue who has consistently
advocated a broader series of protections favored by the White
House and many Democrats but opposed by most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night talks marked the latest turn in a complicated
series of events surrounding the politically sensitive issue, in
which the House and Senate passed widely different versions of the
same bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill, which cleared over the objection of
Hastert and most members of the leadership, would empower patients
with a range of protections, including the right to sue their HMOs
for denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed measure, by comparison, applies to far fewer
individuals, and contains no new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills provide guarantees on other items, including access
to emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at forging a bipartisan compromise appeared to produce
progress at first, but then ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats brought the issue back to the Senate floor
earlier this month, attempting to win approval for the House-passed
measure. They failed, 51-48, and Senate Republicans made it clear
they would turn their attention to trying to find common ground
with House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, charged at the time that Democrats
were committing a ''cynical political act'' in forcing the vote.
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the private talks thus
far had been ''an endless road to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's personal involvement reflects his own long-standing
interest in the issue as well as a belief, often stated in private,
that President Clinton's signature on a compromise measure is vital
for Republicans this election year.
</P>
<P>
   And even agreement among Republicans doesn't guarantee passage
in the House and Senate, much less approval by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
Hastert has discussed the issue privately with Clinton in the past.
His participation in the negotiations in Nickles' office came after
a series of private meetings, including one with the Senate GOP
whip, one with Norwood, and another with the members of the rank
and file who had been involved in the formal negotiations with the
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE ECKEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- For six months, artist Janet
McKenzie has been steadily in demand for radio, television and
newspaper interviews. She has been deluged with letters and e-mails
hailing her as prophetic, begging to buy her painting.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the fame that has come from her work, ''Jesus of the
People.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction has been equal parts fury, as well: letters,
accusations of blasphemy, political correctness, racism, paganism
and ignorance. Framed Plexiglas now protects the painting's
dark-skinned, slightly feminine face crowned with thorns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not one single aspect of that painting that hasn't
been ripped up, shredded, denied, misinterpreted, thrown back in my
face; I've been told this is wrong on every level,'' says McKenzie,
51, at the Blue Heron Gallery in South Burlington, where ''Jesus of
the People'' was exhibited before moving to New York and around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   She details the complaints:
</P>
<P>
   ''His arms are closed. They should be open. Jesus shouldn't be
looking at us that way. He's smiling. He's crying. Why's he got a
crown of thorns? How come the halo's not gold? You have no right to
have a yin-yang symbol in there. Native Americans thanking me.
Native Americans telling me: 'How dare you offend us!'''
</P>
<P>
   She's able to laugh about it now.
</P>
<P>
   On December 14, National Catholic Reporter, a Kansas City,
Mo.-based weekly newspaper circulated in 96 countries, announced
the results of its Jesus 2000 contest. People had been invited to
send in their artwork with their interpretations of what Jesus
should look like in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   From nearly 1,700 entries, McKenzie's oil-on-canvas painting was
chosen as the winner. She received a $2,000 award, and the image
was reprinted on the newspaper's millennium issue cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was potentially a controversy, but we really had no
idea what to expect,'' says Michael Farrell, the paper's editor.
''We didn't think there would be such outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   As a model for the painting, McKenzie used a 25-year-old Vermont
woman of mixed race. Wrapped in a what appears to be thick shawl
and crowned by thorns, the figure looks at the viewer from a pink
background. Over the left shoulder is an eagle's feather, and over
the right, an Asian yin-yang symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a haunting image of a peasant Jesus -- dark,
thick-lipped, looking out on us with ineffable dignity, with
sadness but with confidence,'' wrote Sister Wendy Beckett, the
contest judge.
</P>
<P>
   Other reactions were equally positive.
</P>
<P>
   Some priests wrote National Catholic Reporter to say they had
referred to the painting in their sermons, Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordy Cwik of Landrum, S.C., first saw the painting in his local
newspaper. Though he grew up Catholic, Cwik, 56, says he's not
associated with organized religion now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It opened the door for me to think about Jesus in my own frame
of mind,'' says Cwik, ''not what I've been told what he is, by a
priest, or a rabbi, or a preacher or anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane'a Thomas, graduating from high school in Hampton, Va.,
says she cried when she saw the painting in an issue of Jet
Magazine. When she learned McKenzie was white, it gave the painting
more meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people, they see the typical Jesus as white, with
blue eyes and blond hair... The way she painted him, it was
everybody, all the skin colors mixed together,'' Thomas says.
</P>
<P>
   For others, McKenzie's Jesus resembled Jimi Hendrix, a drug
dealer, death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal or Michael Jordan. They
called it ''garbage,'' ''utter stupidity,'' ''an embarrassment.''
Some demanded it be destroyed. Some saw in the painting the
Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Hord of Fort Myers, Fla., stumbled across the painting
during his Internet wanderings, he instantly disliked it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that that painting won a contest really does offend
me,'' says Hord, a 54-year-old Methodist who runs a small business
selling goods to flea markets. ''It goes against everything I think
of when I think of Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the spirit of the painting -- dark and foreboding -- that's
troubling, he says; Jesus' image should be one of happiness, joy
and elation. He accuses McKenzie of what he calls iconoclasm and
''patently false feminist ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristy Moore, who attends a Southern Baptist church in Grand
Rapids, Mich., acknowledged nobody knows what Jesus looked like.
But the Bible gives guidance, she says, adding that she thought
McKenzie needed to study the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, people try to bend and shape the image of Jesus
...,'' says the 29-year-old homemaker. ''When it comes to Christ, I
don't think it's something to be played with. He's not just another
person.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie moved to Vermont from Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1976. Five
years ago, she began to include overt religious images in her work,
beginning with a depiction of St. James in a painting that was a
gift for a priest in Island Pond, where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   In painting ''Jesus of the People,'' controversy wasn't
McKenzie's intent. But she says she's glad the painting has made
people think. Her young mixed-race nephew in Los Angeles, she says,
would never have been able to see himself in more traditional
representations of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The painting ''isn't about race or gender, first. It's about the
essence of Jesus, which is about grace and love, first and
foremost,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not meant to fix the world's problems. It's really not
meant to be anything other than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   What's unfortunate, McKenzie says, is the prospect that people
might try to damage the painting. Last fall at the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, a dung-decorated painting of the Virgin Mary was vandalized
by a man who considered it blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the Plexiglas, which McKenzie feels detracts from
her painting.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no problems at the Schimmel Center for the Arts
at New York City's Pace University, which has exhibited 37
paintings from the Jesus 2000 contest since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been heated discussions, said Jillian Panfel,
managing director at the center. The exhibit has been the most
successful ever at the center, said Panfel, noting that McKenzie's
painting stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like it's brought nothing brought joy to me,'' she
says. ''But I'm Jewish. What I do I know?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesus of the People'' and the other paintings will be on
display at the Schimmel Center in New York through June 30, before
moving to the Catholic Theologic Seminary in Chicago as part of a
seven-city national tour.

<HEADLINE> Marlboro introduces ordinance to ban cell phone use by drivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARLBORO, N.J. (AP) - Officials last night took the first step
in an effort to ban the use of cellular phones while driving in the
township.
</P>
<P>
   The Township Council introduced an ordinance that would make it
unlawful for motorists to use cell phones. Violators would be fined
up to $250.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the ordinance is aimed at preventing deadly
crashes caused by drivers dialing or talking on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval of the ordinance could come after a public
hearing scheduled for July 13. The ordinance must also receive
approval from the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John O. Bennett III, R-Monmouth, the township
attorney, said the ordinance is necessary to stop a rising number
of fatal accidents caused by motorists using cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more voices that are raised, the more it can make a
difference to families that have suffered tragedies and can prevent
other families from suffering tragedies,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of 22 states that have proposed a ban on cell
phone use by drivers. A bill pending in the state Senate would fine
drivers using cell phones up to $250. A bill in the Assembly is
before the Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the N.J. Wireless Carriers Coalition said the
group has misgivings about Marlboro's proposed ordinance and
supports a pending state Senate bill that would create a task force
to study the problem.

<HEADLINE> Summer food programs struggle to reach schoolchildren  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After getting free or reduced-price meals
during the school year, more than a million kids fail to take
advantage of summertime food programs across the state, according
to a nutrition watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   The federally-funded Summer Food Program provided free meals to
325,500 children in New York state last year, serving food at
various neighborhood sites including playgrounds, schools and
community centers, according to the Nutrition Consortium of New
York State.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half of children in need - as defined by the
number of kids who take advantage of free and reduced-price school
meal programs - do not participate in the summer programs,
according to the anti-hunger activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they need the meals during the school year, chances are
they need the meals during the summer,'' said Lisa Harmon, of the
Nutrition Consortium of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In upstate New York, fewer than 14 percent of low-income
children took advantage of the program in 1999 and eight counties -
Greene, Hamilton, Lewis, Schoharie, Tioga, Tompkins, Washington and
Wyoming - had no sites operating in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the counties with the best participation rates in the
summer programs compared with the participation in the school-year
plans were: Essex (40.2 percent), Erie (29.9), Cayuga (24.6),
Franklin (24.5), Broome (24.4) and Onondaga (23.3).
</P>
<P>
   Of the counties that operated sites, those with the worst
participation rates were: Seneca (0.0 percent), Saratoga and
Genesee (0.5), Orleans (0.8), Allegany (1.0), Ontario (2.1) and
Delaware (2.5).
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference between the number of eligible and
participating children in the summer food program reveals a gaping
hole in our state's nutritional safety net,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for low participation rates including a lack of
awareness and a lack of sponsors in many areas of the state,
according to Edie Mesick, executive director of the nutrition
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines require that at least 50 percent of the
children living within the area of a summer meal site have family
incomes at or below 185 percent of poverty level. And, while city
neighborhoods can meet that criteria, suburban or rural communities
frequently can't.
</P>
<P>
   Program supporters also say it is difficult to find enough
agencies willing to host a summer meal site because of low federal
reimbursement rates. This year those rates are expected to total
$1.34 for breakfast, $2.37 for lunch and 55 cents for a snack.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the state has paid $3.3 million to help supplement
those rates, giving programs last year approximately 4 additional
cents for breakfast, 14 cents more for lunch and a penny extra for
the snack. But this year, even that supplement is uncertain because
New York City is expected to have a high summer school enrollment,
reducing the amount of state money available to other sites. ---

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 11, Giants 10  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Craig Paquette's RBI single off the glove of
reliever Mark Gardner gave the St. Louis Cardinals -- seven runs
down in the fifth inning -- an 11-10 victory over the San Francisco
Giants on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (4-3) hit Mark McGwire with a pitch to start the ninth
and Eli Marrero pinch ran. Ray Lankford singled with one out and
Paquette followed with a one-hopper to the mound that appeared to
handcuff Gardner. But the ball squibbed away near the third-base
line.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire tied Mike Schmidt for seventh place on the career home
run list, hitting No. 548 in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston tied his career high with six RBIs, and his
eighth-inning three-run homer -- his second home run of the game --
brought the Cardinals back from a seven-run deficit to a 10-9 lead.
Dunston, who batted leadoff for the first time all season, also
homered in the seventh and had a two-run double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent had a three-run homer to ignite the Giants' eight-run
fifth against Pat Hentgen, and tied it at 10 with an RBI single off
Dave Veres (1-2) in the ninth. A shaky outing from Shawn Estes
helped the Cardinals climb back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston's sixth homer came on an 0-1 count against Felix
Rodriguez and with an assist from left fielder Barry Bonds. Bonds
made a leaping attempt at the wall, but the ball bounced off the
heel of his glove and over the wall as Bonds sagged.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first homer in three games produced the game's first
run with two outs in the fourth. His 26th of the season tied Bonds
for the major league lead. It also was the Cardinals' first hit off
Estes, who contributed a two-run double in the fifth to give him
eight RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Estes struggled after the Giants sent 13 batters to the plate,
failing to retire any of the five batters he faced in the bottom
half of the inning. He walked Larry Sutton with the bases loaded,
threw a bases-loaded wild pitch, then exited after giving up
Dunston's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's homer came on a 2-0 pitch and traveled an estimated
475 feet to straightaway center, giving him 101 homers and 214 RBIs
in 212 career games at Busch Stadium. He's on pace to hit 59 homers
this season after hitting 65 last year and a record 70 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire reached 548 homers in 5,832 at-bats, while it took
Schmidt 8,352 at-bats. Earlier this season, McGwire passed Jimmie
Foxx (534) and Mickey Mantle (536). Reggie Jackson is sixth on the
career list with 563.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen walked eight and threw 106 pitches in 4 2-3 innings,
allowing eight runs on seven hits as his ERA rose to 5.85. Hentgen
won his previous two starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had five hits and five walks, two to Bonds, in the
fifth. Hentgen was chased after Marvin Benard, the 10th batter of
the inning, hit a two-run double. Bill Mueller added an RBI single
off reliever Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow hit his sixth home run leading off the sixth for the
Giants. Pinch-hitter J.D. Drew tripled and scored on Paquette's
sacrifice fly in the bottom half, and Dunston hit his fifth home
run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants are averaging a major league-leading 7.2 runs in
Estes' starts. ... The Cardinals lead the majors with 121 homers
and have connected in all but 14 of their 71 games. ... Before
Thursday, Cardinals starters worked five or more innings in 29
straight games dating to May 19. ... Kent's 70 RBIs are the Giants'
highest pre-All-Star break total since Bonds had 68 in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index rose Friday
morning on buying by institutional investors. The U.S. dollar was
lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 75.77
points, or 0.44 percent, to 17,181.78 at the end of the morning
session. On Thursday, the average closed down 104.07 points, or
0.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.58 yen in late morning, down 0.32 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 104.44
yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started lower in thin trading on
profit-taking by investors, who were discouraged by an overnight
decline on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nikkei average moved into positive territory as Japanese
institutional investors bought issues at dips toward the morning
closing bell, traders said.

<HEADLINE> Farming Key in Zimbabwe Election  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUTORASHANGA, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Eight days after he planted
tobacco seedlings, Bob Fraser-Mackenzie surveyed his crops on the
land his family has worked since his great-grandfather purchased it
in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has sprouted yet, but even when it does,
Fraser-Mackenzie and his family may not be around to see the long,
bushy leaves or pocket the profit from the crop.
</P>
<P>
   If President Robert Mugabe pushes ahead after this weekend's
parliamentary election with his threat to seize white-owned farms,
Fraser-Mackenzie will probably have to leave the only home he's
ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is rule of law, I will keep my farm,'' he said. ''If
there is no rule of law, I will move somewhere else. I prefer to be
a refugee.''
</P>
<P>
   His farm is not among the more than 1,600 occupied by black
militants, nor is it on a list of the first 804 farms targeted for
seizure. But Mugabe has said he would accelerate farm takeovers and
his hard-line stance has unsettled most of Zimbabwe's 4,000 white
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   An exodus of commercial farmers would likely crush an already
struggling economy. Tobacco exports are the single leading source
of hard currency, bringing in 35 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial farmers suffer from an overvalued currency rate
and are burdened by high-interest loans. James Jowa, an economist
with the National Chamber of Commerce, said the farm occupations,
which began in February, are expected to shave more than 10 percent
off Zimbabwe's economic output this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Zimbabweans, Fraser-Mackenzie agrees land reform is
sorely needed here, where a few thousand whites own more than a
fifth of the agricultural land and millions of blacks live in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to subdivide his farm in Mutorashanga, 60 miles
northwest of Harare, and sell some of the land. But authorities
have stymied such attempts by other farmers, said farm consultant
David Blackwell, and previous land redistribution efforts have been
mostly unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers see Mugabe's threat as a campaign ploy to win
support from blacks who have seen little or no improvement in
living standards during Mugabe's 20-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change,
says it would begin land reform by giving poor blacks underutilized
land, properties that were allocated improperly and land made
available through voluntary subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks farming communal land would get titles -- which they don't
have now -- said MDC legal adviser David Coltart, giving them
collateral for loans to buy machinery, seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Mhurudzekunze, 27, and her husband received a 12-acre
plot south of Harare four years ago as part of a redistribution
program, and have struggled to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Yields of maize, groundnuts and tobacco are low, and they can't
afford chemicals and tools to improve harvests. Still, she says
they are managing to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Mhurudzekunze supports land reform, but said recipients must
also get money and training so they can farm efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good for us to get land, but if we don't have money, we
can't (grow enough to) bring foreign currency into the country,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser-Mackenzie's crops will need to be harvested in six to
eight months and the processed leaves will be sold from May to
September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he has looked at Canada and Mozambique but
hasn't made any firm plans for himself, his wife and their two
young children.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Migrant Families Fear Worst  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANGLE, China (AP) -- Their grief-stricken wails filling the
two-room brick house, a dozen women mourn a young relative who was
trying to have herself smuggled into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   With no word on her fate, her family assumes the worst -- that
the woman in her 20s was among 58 Chinese found dead Sunday in a
truckload of tomatoes at the English Channel port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead left relatives in Changle, a southeastern
Chinese city surrounded by farmland and known as a hub for migrant
smuggling. Authorities have added to their distress by flooding the
area with police and launching a dragnet for migrant families.
</P>
<P>
   Police worked through the night Tuesday questioning families in
villages around Changle, but none admitted losing a son or daughter
in Britain, said an official contacted by phone at the city
management office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult,'' said the official, who would not give
his name. ''A lot of families don't want to admit they had people
on that trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed Chinese response reflects frustration at trying
to satisfy foreign pressure to stem an outflow of migrants
estimated by U.S. officials at up to 100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   China increased penalties last year for migrants, threatening
them with up to a year in jail if caught. And U.S. and Australian
diplomats have joined in publicity campaigns against dealing with
smugglers, known as ''snakeheads.'' Their gangs sometime hold
migrants for ransom or force them into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, migrants pay smugglers up to $60,000, going deep
into debt in hopes of finding menial work in restaurants or
sweatshops. Some travel by air on false papers. Others endure
weeks-long journeys by truck or cargo container.
</P>
<P>
   Today's migrants are following tradition in China's densely
populated southeast, which for centuries has sent people to seek
their fortunes abroad. Descendants of earlier waves of emigration
are the elite of Singapore and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants appear driven as much by ambition and the promise --
real or imaginary -- of foreign opportunity as by any economic
problems at home. Changle and surrounding Fujian province are
better off than some parts of China, bustling with construction and
exporting fish and produce. Money sent home by migrants has
financed houses and businesses -- though it also whets local
appetites for more.
</P>
<P>
   The outflow from many Fujian villages is so steady that they are
identified with the individual countries where they send migrants.
From Yanyu, they go to Germany, while from neighboring Zhanggang,
the destination is Japan. Nearby towns send people to Britain, the
United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary by destination, and people in the area say getting
to Britain costs $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''These deaths won't affect people's desire to go abroad,'' said
a 35-year-old truck driver in Changle who would give only his
family name, Chen. ''The chances to send home money are tremendous.
You can make a $1,000 to $1,300 a month in Britain. You can't make
that in a year here.''
</P>
<P>
   A heavy police presence made residents reluctant to talk to
reporters. The number of extra officers in and around Changle
appeared to number in the hundreds. Twenty cars from law
enforcement agencies swarmed over the nearby village of Jinfeng, a
close-packed gathering of ramshackle brick-and-concrete apartment
blocks lining narrow, dusty streets.
</P>
<P>
   In Yanyu, the home of the family mourning the female migrant was
so simple and plain that it had no pictures on the walls or other
decoration. Three women and a teen-age girl in worn work clothes
sprawled sobbing on a bed in the front room, while others sat on a
vinyl couch and rough wooden benches. The home was one of dozens
separated by narrow lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after a foreign reporter arrived, two police officers
pushed their way into the house past the mourners and ordered him
out of the town, shouting, ''No interviews! No interviews!''
</P>
<P>
   Six U.S. and European journalists who tried to visit towns
around Changle on Thursday were detained by police for several
hours and then ordered out of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Changle, the Fujian provincial government and
Beijing refused to release any details on the identities of the
migrants found dead in the British port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily identified one as a
24-year-old man from a village near Fuqing, a city southwest of
Changle. It quoted neighbors who said he hoped to make money abroad
after having suffered business losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government's mixed official feelings about migrants
echoed in a statement Thursday expressing sympathy over the deaths
in Britain. It accused foreign governments of encouraging migrants
by granting some political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain countries should learn from this tragedy,'' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.

<HEADLINE> Royals 4, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Belcher limited Kansas City to one
hit in the first six innings, leading the Anaheim Angels to a 4-3
victory Thursday night for his first win in eight career decisions
against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher (2-0), in his second start following a stint on the
disabled list, gave up three runs and three hits in six-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year veteran, who spent three seasons with Kansas City
before signing with the Angels as a free agent in December 1998,
had surgery on his right elbow last December and hadn't pitched for
the Angels until last Saturday at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye hit a two-run homer in the first off Belcher, who
left following Joe Randa's leadoff single in the seventh and Mark
Quinn's double. Mark Petkovsek, who allowed an RBI groundout to
Gregg Zaun, got eight outs for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina's two-run homer tied it at 2 in the second, and
the Angels took a 4-2 lead with in the third against Jay Witasick
(1-7), who was hurt when left fielder Johnny Damon allowed Darin
Erstad's leadoff single through his legs for a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro hit a go-ahead single, Mo Vaughn doubled and
Garret Anderson had an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Erstad, the Angels' leadoff hitter, singled three times
leading off an inning. ... Of the Royals' 25 hits during their
three-game series with the Angels, 22 were singles. Overall this
season, 69.3 percent of Kansas City's hits have been singles -- the
highest percentage in the majors. ... Kansas City was the only AL
team Belcher had never beaten. He had defeated every NL team except
Arizona and Colorado, the only two he has never faced. ... Royals
hitters have struck out 354 times, the fewest in the majors.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel is prepared to give the Palestinians part of
Jerusalem and all of the strategic Jordan Valley, according to an American
document summing up the negotiations so far, Israel television reported

Texas Inmate Graham Executed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Gary Graham, subject of the most contentious Texas
death penalty case since Gov. George W. Bush began running for president, was
executed Thursday night after putting up a struggle and insisting he was
innocent of a 1981 murder. Graham, 36, received a lethal injection for the
killing of a man in a holdup outside a Houston supermarket. The state parole
board and appeals courts rejected his arguments that he was convicted on shaky
evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a poor job. Bush
said he supported the execution and pointed out that Graham's case had been
reviewed by 33 state and federal judges.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday that, despite
her denials, there is ''substantial evidence'' that Hillary Rodham Clinton
played a role in White House travel office firings, but the prosecutor said he
won't bring charges because there's not enough evidence to convict the first
lady. The announcement comes less than six months before the 2000 election. Mrs.

proposed Clinton administration rules giving workers new protections against
repetitive motion injuries. The 57-41 vote was mostly along party lines, and
came several days after the House adopted a similar ban. Democrats said the
regulations developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration could

<HEADLINE> Yankees, Tigers Have Tentative Deal  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Yankees and Detroit Tigers agreed Thursday
to a tentative trade that could eventually bring outfielder Juan
Gonzalez to New York.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word of an agreement from either team, but the deal
was confirmed to The Associated Press by a baseball lawyer who
spoke on the condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, the lawyer said, would send outfielder Ricky Ledee,
minor league third baseman Drew Henson and pitcher Randy Keisler to
Detroit for the two-time American League Most Valuable Player, who
is eligible for free agency after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be for Gonzalez to waive his no-trade
clause. Only when that happens, would the Yankees be given a
72-hour window to sign Gonzalez to a contract extension. The
extension would be needed to make the trade final.
</P>
<P>
   ''What deal?'' Gonzalez said in Toronto before going 1-for-3 in
Detroit's 7-4 loss to the Blue Jays. ''Rumors. There's lots of
rumors. I'm going to talk to my agent after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gonzalez said he had made his decision, but he
didn't reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what are his favorite cities, he said: ''A quiet
city. A nice place.''
</P>
<P>
   While it appeared Gonzalez wasn't interested in New York, the
Yankees did not immediately receive a formal response, the lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Yankees acquired a slugger from Detroit, it
was Cecil Fielder, and he wound up helping New York win the 1996
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But while Roger Clemens and Chuck Knoblauch pushed for trades to
New York, others stars have stayed a way. In December, Ken Griffey
Jr. said he would block a trade from Seattle to the New York Mets,
and two months later the Mariners dealt him to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez refuses to go to New York, the Yankees probably
would turn their attention back to Sammy Sosa. Talks with Chicago
haven't progressed because of the Cubs' demands, two baseball
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A new contract for Gonzalez figures to be a major obstacle for
the Yankees. After acquiring Gonzalez from Texas on Nov. 2 in a
nine-player trade, the Tigers attempted to sign him to an
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was said to have offered a $140 million, eight-year
deal, which would be baseball's richest in total and average, but
Gonzalez was said to have wanted $148 million or more. The figures
have never been confirmed by the Tigers or Gonzalez's agents.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tigers general manager Randy Smith nor Gonzalez's
agents, Jim Bronner and Bob Gilhooley, were available for comment.
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as anything being close to happening, I don't know
anything more now than I did before,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said in Boston after lunching with owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Left field and designated hitter have been major disappointments
for the Yankees, causing Steinbrenner to push for change. Ledee is
hitting .239 with six homers and 28 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 30-year-old right-handed hitter, also has struggled,
batting just .260 with 13 homers and 30 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, who will be Michigan's starting quarterback this fall,
is a third-base prospect and was selected to play in baseball's
prestigious Futures game in Atlanta next month, but there's no
assurance he will choose baseball over football.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't like talking about it,'' Ledee said. ''If they
make it, they make it. It's not my choice, at some time, it can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have won three World Series titles in four
years, dropped a half-game behind Boston in the AL East with the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Yankees made a trade to address one of
their needs, acquiring ifielder Jose Vizcaino from Los Angeles for
utilityman Jim Leyritz. Vizcaino can serve as a backup at second
base to the scatter-armed Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   New York began the night ninth in the AL in home runs with 85
and sixth in batting average at .278.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees officials have argued that instead of offense, New
York should concentrate its efforts on pitching. David Cone (1-6)
and Clemens (4-6) have struggled, Clemens is on the disabled list
and Orlando Hernandez sprained an elbow last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at 4.43, the Yankees began the night with the league's
third-best ERA, trailing only Boston (3.95) and Chicago (4.34).

<HEADLINE> First Lady Won't Face Travel Charge  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New Yorkers weighing the U.S. Senate
candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton have been given a fresh
reminder of scandals that have dogged the first lady and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday that he will not
charge Mrs. Clinton over the 1993 firings in the White House travel
office but said there is ''substantial evidence'' she played a role
-- despite her denials.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs.
Clinton's statements and testimony about the matter were
''knowingly false.'' He has closed the investigation into the 1993
firings of all seven employees of the travel office, which spurred
one of the first major controversies of President Clinton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has not been a high-profile one in Mrs. Clinton's
campaign against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, but independent
pollster Lee Miringoff said ''it's obviously unwelcome news for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to lose the election for her, but it's not a
plus,'' added Jay Severin, a New York GOP political operative and
commentator. ''The biggest problem is that it reinforces a major
existing negative for her. It's a major reminder that she appears
to be among those who look like they're above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has denied playing any role in the firings, an
assertion challenged in a memo by former White House administration
director David Watkins. Ray concluded that Mrs. Clinton's
discussions with presidential aides and friends ''ultimately
influenced Watkins' decision to fire the travel office employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nevertheless, the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and
testimony regarding her involvement in the travel office firings
were knowingly false,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers served at the pleasure of the president and could
have been terminated without any reason.
</P>
<P>
   The White House conducted an internal review and issued a public
apology, saying the firings had been mishandled. It reprimanded
four presidential aides while recommending that five of the former
employees be given new government jobs. The former head of the
office was acquitted of financial wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators later concluded that deputy White House counsel
Vince Foster was despondent over the controversy before his 1993
suicide in a Virginia park. In a diary released by the White House,
Foster expressed concern that presidential aides would become
entangled in investigations and worried that a role by Mrs. Clinton
would be misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   The firings became a partisan issue, with Republicans accusing
the White House of pressing the FBI to open a criminal
investigation to justify the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Ray criticized the White House for what he
called ''substantial resistance'' to providing evidence, including
documents and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, accused the Independent Counsel of
politicizing an investigation that has dragged on far too long.
</P>
<P>
   ''After seven years and the expense of tens of millions of
taxpayer dollars, the Independent Counsel confirms what we have
said all along: There is no evidence that the first lady did
anything wrong,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio's campaign refused to comment on Ray's statement,
other New York Republicans said it would hamper the first lady's
run even if the GOP doesn't flog it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's got legs of its own,'' New York state GOP
Chairman William Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff noted that Ray's actual report is sealed for at least
90 days, meaning there could be fresh news reports on it at a key
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes out in September, the Clinton people will say
it's old news, but for those suffering from a heavy bout of Clinton
fatigue it's more of the same,'' said Miringoff, who heads Marist
College's Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Severin said it might have been better for Clinton's campaign if
Ray had said he would seek an indictment of the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''She always does better when she's a victim,'' said the GOP
strategist, who is not involved in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign and State Democratic Party Chairwoman
Judith Hope, a major booster of the first lady's Senate run, said
she didn't think the Ray report would have any impact on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically no news,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty million dollars, six years later, the report confirms
what Hillary has said all along, that she did nothing wrong,'' Hope
said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran New York Democratic operative Hank Sheinkopf agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saying somebody is heavily involved and calling them a crook
is entirely different,'' said Sheinkopf, who is not involved in the
Senate race. ''There is no hard proof that can wind up on a
television commercial that says in fact she did something wrong.''

<HEADLINE> PRI Faces Challenge in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For many Mexicans, the idea of a government
without the Institutional Revolutionary Party is almost
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But after 71 years in power, the party known as the PRI faces a
presidential election so tight -- and seemingly clean -- that it
could find itself, for the first time, in the opposition if
National Action Party candidate Vicente Fox wins on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it (the PRI) could stand it,'' said political
historian Lorenzo Meyer of the elite Colegio de Mexico. ''It would
be losing its backbone. I don't know if it would be capable of
continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-President Plutarco Elias Calles created the PRI in 1929 as
the party of government to unify the squabbling factions that had
won the Mexican Revolution and to create a system that transferred
power peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   It was a spectacular, if heavy-handed, success.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders who had vied for power were brought into the
party. So were unions and farm groups. Government workers were
forced to contribute. Government funds were regularly siphoned off
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   There was only a fuzzy line between government and party,
similar to that between the Soviet government and Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   One of Calles' successors, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, modernized and
broadened the party, cementing the president's domination. He also
started to wean it away from the military -- though every Mexican
president until 1946 was a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, those who challenged the PRI were labeled as
unpatriotic, and most were either bought off or crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's ideology is fuzzy, and often seemed more about power
than principle.
</P>
<P>
   For five decades it stood for big government, anti-clericalism
and -- at one point -- socialist education. Since 1982, three
successive presidents have turned it into a crusader for free
markets and private enterprise, not without resistance from the
rank and file. It has even made peace with the Roman Catholic
Church it once battled.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about its image abroad and pressured by reformers
domestically, the PRI gradually shed direct links with the
government and slowly transformed itself into something like a
normal party.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right National Action Party that now backs Fox was
gradually allowed to have a few congressmen. In 1989, it won its
first governorship -- a victory recognized by President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, whose own election had been stained by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms under Salinas and current President Ernesto Zedillo
created stronger rules against government meddling in elections.
Trying to reform itself, the PRI even held an open primary this
year, won by Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Yet party activists almost instinctively still look to the
president for guidance. A system that bans re-election to most
posts means congressmen, governors and others depend on
presidential goodwill to continue political careers.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, vast networks of labor, farm and business
organizations -- membership is mandatory in many -- are tied to the
PRI. They look to the government for patronage and for political
positions.
</P>
<P>
   If the PRI lost its backbone, the presidency, analysts say there
would be a nationwide struggle for power as governors and other
old-line PRI power brokers tried to fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect it to fall apart,'' said political scientist
Federico Estevez of the Autonomous Technical Institute of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter whether Labastida loses, the PRI will still be the
major party if not the majority party in the Senate'' and would
''still have 20 governorships and a very widespread apparatus at
the lower levels.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the PRI might move from its free-market stance to a more
populist position, battling with the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, to appeal to labor and farm groups that might be
opposed to Fox's conservative economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   For farm groups, ''you might switch off the PRD, but why go to
such a minority party?'' Estevez asked. ''You might as well stay
where you are'' and rely on PRI strength in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the PRI would probably lose much of its business
sector, which would find Fox more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Some PRI activists might jump to Democratic Revolution, which
already has a sizable faction of former PRI members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with a party that never, never, never in its
life experienced being outside of power,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm anxious to see how it is going to work.''

<HEADLINE> Economy Important in Japan Election  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The message from voters leading up to Japan's
parliamentary elections this weekend is clear: Get the shaky
economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
   How to accomplish that is more complex, sparking a sharp debate
between the Japanese ruling party and its political opposition --
and testing the nation's tolerance for change.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are weary of a long decade of economic weakness.
Unemployment is at a near-record high of 4.8 percent, the national
debt has ballooned and heightened anxiety is lifting crime and
suicide rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic recovery is the biggest overall issue in this
election,'' said Yoshiomi Takano, a 26-year-old bank employee in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition -- led by Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's
Liberal Democratic Party -- and its opposition offer sharply
different solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP wants to continue doling out public spending, while the
opposition wants to rein in the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that gets chosen in the vote on Sunday is critical
to Japan's economic future. More than 1,400 candidates are vying
for 480 seats in Parliament's lower house, the more powerful of two
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition isn't expected to topple the ruling coalition but
could give it a good scare, partly because of widespread
disenchantment over the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japan Democratic Party, the largest opposition group, tells
voters they must face up to the pain of ballooning national debt,
and pay higher taxes. It cautions against getting lured by promises
of more pork-barrel projects from the ruling coalition led by Mori,
who replaced Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi after Obuchi suffered a
stroke in April. Obuchi died in May.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is among the world's most indebted industrialized nations.
Its public debt exceeds $5.9 trillion, or nearly 130 percent of its
gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services it
produces. The U.S. national debt is roughly about half its GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Like smaller opposition parties, the Japan Democrats advocate
less government. Where they differ is pushing for the tax increase,
which would eliminate exemptions for nonworking spouses and elderly
dependents.
</P>
<P>
   Mori and his coalition partners argue against chasing ''two
rabbits'' at once -- spurring economic recovery while trimming the
national debt. They say the government can't risk choking off a
recovery with a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our most important task is to achieve economic recovery,''
Mori said recently. ''Signs of brighter times are beginning to
emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew a bare 0.5 percent last year but Mori is
touting that as a victory, coming after two years of contractions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling coalition says stability is key to that recovery, and
some economists agree.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenario is for the ruling coalition to stay in power,
said Yukari Sato, an economist with Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in
Tokyo, warning that debt reduction should wait a couple of years
until the economy is stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a vacuum in leadership is risky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the economic debate is structural reform.
</P>
<P>
   Change has come slowly to Japan, which is dominated by a myriad
of rigid rules left from a period following World War II when
bureaucrats helped orchestrate Japan's dramatic economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party is supporting such changes as looser
regulations, helping the technology industry through subsidies and
encouraging start-ups to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition says the LDP is too entrenched to enact real
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Liberal Democrats are too entangled in old-style politics
to bring change,'' said Noboru Usami, a Japan Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While the economy is the top issue in many voters' minds, a lot
of Japanese lack faith in the solutions offered by either side in
the election. A survey published Wednesday by the Asahi newspaper
showed 52 percent of voters did not support any party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cleric Clings To Monastary  </HEADLINE>
By JASMINA KELEMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) -- Father Sampson's home is a two-room
trailer with electric fans that do little to ease searing desert
heat. A bucket under a faucet catches scarce drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the hardships, the Chicago-born Russian Orthodox
monk plans to cling to the little corner of a West Bank monastery
he says belongs to his church.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who arrived in Jericho last month, is locked in the
latest battle between rival church factions that dates back to the
1917 Russian revolution. This time, the dispute has drawn in Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority on the side of the ''red'' Russian
Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
   The ''white'' church, to which Sampson belongs, split at the
time of the 1917 revolution, when communists gained control of the
Russian Orthodox Church. Refusing to bow to communist authority,
the white church became the church-in-exile, while today the red
church answers to its hierarchy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years, pilgrims and visiting clergy of the white church
could worship at the small stone chapel located on the grounds of
the Garden Monastery in the biblical West Bank town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   But since January, when Palestinian police evicted three white
church priests, Sampson's colleagues have been relegated to a
trailer in the corner of the compound. Now they are trying to
maintain a continuous presence on the grounds to stave off loss of
the monastery to the red church.
</P>
<P>
   The property dispute garnered international attention when
Sister Maria, the former Maria Stephanopolous of New York and a
sister of former White House spokesman George Stephanopolous, spent
six weeks holed up in the compound earlier this year with another
white church nun.
</P>
<P>
   In February, under pressure from U.S. diplomats, the Palestinian
police promised to treat both churches evenhandedly until the
property dispute was resolved. Father Sampson, however, says
treatment is far from equal.
</P>
<P>
   He said his movements are usually watched by a Palestinian
soldier and he is not allowed to come closer than 80 yards to the
monastery's chapel. Nuns affiliated with the red church enter the
chapel at will, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Father Sampson, who first came to Jericho two years ago to spend
a summer helping restore church property, said he made close
Palestinian friends during that sojourn. Now, though, some of those
friends have been interrogated by Palestinian police, and are
afraid to visit him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Father Sampson and Sister Maria, who was visiting the
compound Thursday, said they had been rebuffed in attempts to meet
with Palestinian officials. Emile Jarjoui, head of Christian
affairs for the Palestinian National Authority, said he was not
aware of any unfair treatment of white church clergy, and promised
to meet them later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1917 split, the white church has controlled Russian
Orthodox properties in the West Bank. The red church gained control
of property that fell within the borders of Israel in 1948, ceded
to it as a gesture of gratitude for the Soviet Union's early
recognition of the new state.
</P>
<P>
   The white church clerics and nuns in Jericho believe Palestinian
officials hope that hardships will force them to give up their
vigil. But both Father Sampson and Sister Maria said they were sure
their church could maintain its foothold until its claim could be
proven.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Agent Resurfaces in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Former CIA agent Philip Agee, a longtime friend of
communist Cuba who exposed purported CIA operatives in his infamous
book, has resurfaced in Havana, where he has launched what he says
is the first independent American business in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   With European investors and the state-run travel agent as his
partner, Agee has opened a travel Web site designed specifically to
bring American tourists to the island -- even if it means violating
the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The site, cubalinda.com, offers package tours within Cuba and
other help with Cuban tourism that is largely off limits to
Americans because of U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see people ignore the law,'' Agee said at a
press conference Thursday. ''The idea is to disdain this law to the
point that our grandfathers disdained Prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Agee has long enraged supporters of U.S. sanctions on Cuba by
his support of Fidel Castro's revolution and campaign to end the
nearly four-decade-old embargo, which limits American tourists from
spending money on the island -- effectively barring them from
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been accused of receiving up to $1 million in
payments from the Cuban intelligence service. He has denied the
accusations, which were first made by a high-ranking Cuban
intelligence officer and defector in a 1992 Los Angeles Times
report.
</P>
<P>
   Agee, 65, quit the CIA in 1969 after 12 years with the agency,
working mostly in Latin America during the years that leftist
movements were gaining prominence and sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   His 1975 book ''Inside the Company: CIA Diary'' cited alleged
CIA misdeeds against leftists in Latin America that included a
22-page list of purported agency operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush, the wife of former president George Bush -- himself
a onetime CIA chief -- in her autobiography accused the book of
exposing a CIA station chief, Richard S. Welch, who was later
killed by leftist terrorists in Athens in 1975. Agee, who denied
any involvement in the death, sued her for defamation and she
revised the book to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   Agee's U.S. passport was revoked in 1979. U.S. officials said he
had threatened national security.
</P>
<P>
   After years of living in Hamburg, Germany -- occasionally
underground, fearing CIA retribution -- Agee has decided to make
Havana his home and the seat of his new business.
</P>
<P>
   American companies have been barred from doing business with
Cuba since the embargo was imposed in the 1960s to put pressure on
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have a license. I don't have permission. I haven't
asked and I'm not going to because it's a question of principle,''
Agee said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the U.S. Treasury Department in Washington said
officials were unaware of Agee's plans and had no comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Agee said he received funding for the tourism project from
European investors, but declined to say how much or even who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not especially interested in advertising the fact
that they're involved with me here,'' Agee said, acknowledging his
own infamy.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which has been partially running since February,
on Friday is to launch its first major promotion targeted at
Americans -- a weeklong tour during carnival festivities in July and
August.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at around $600 inclusive -- although not including
airfare, which must be arranged separately and through a third
country unless the visitor receives a Treasury Department license,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tours must be pre-paid over the Internet to a European bank
account run by the company -- a rare concession to U.S. law in that
the money isn't directly deposited in a Cuban account.
</P>
<P>
   Agee said he has received no word from the U.S. government about
his dealings. But he has received threatening e-mails from people
he believes are anti-Castro Cuban-American exiles in Miami, who are
opposed to any dealings with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always nice to know that your enemy, or that your
unfriendly side, knows that you're in business,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fire in Australian Hostel Kills 15  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PASSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILDERS, Australia (AP) -- Terrified young travelers fled across
rooftops when a pre-dawn fire engulfed a hostel in eastern
Australia where around 90 international backpackers were staying
Friday, killing at least 15. Three others were missing and presumed
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Raging flames quickly overwhelmed the century-old Palace
Backpackers Hostel, a two-story wooden building in the small town
of Childers, and firefighters -- unable to enter the building
because of the thick smoke -- used hydraulic platforms to rescue
guests trapped on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Backpackers from at least six countries who were staying in the
hostel awoke to the sound of glass shattering and other guests
shouting warnings that the building was on fire, survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaped off the verandahs on both stories of the
Victorian-style building to shops located on both sides of it along
a main street. Others complained that some of the windows in the
rooms had bars on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lying awake and all of a sudden I heard the most
tremendous sound of cracking glass,'' one backpacker told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. ''I screamed at the girls in
my dorm, 'Wake up!' because I thought somebody was trying to break
the place up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as one of them woke up she smelled the smoke and
yelled 'Fire!' Another one tried the door but got her hand burned.
We ran out onto the verandah and escaped onto the roof of the shop
next door,'' said the survivor, whose name wasn't given in the
radio report. ''We were really lucky. We didn't see the smoke of
flames until we got out. Once we were out on the roof panic set
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the victims weren't immediately known. Police
said it would take at least 24 hours before the victims would be
identified and their families informed. Of the 15 fatalities and
three missing, 10 were from the United Kingdom, three from
Australia, two from Holland, and one each from Spain, Japan and
South Korea, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters spent four hours battling the blaze before it was
extinguished. The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard described it as ''a terrible
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Local fire commissioner Jeff Wright said the fire would have
spread quickly throughout the wooden building. ''These people would
have had no warning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said around 90 people were believed to be staying in the
hostel. Seventy of those had fled or were rescued by firefighters.
Nine of those saved were taken to a hospital. Fifteen people died,
and three were unaccounted for, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, Briton Keith O'Brien, said he had to kick down a
door and squeeze through window bars to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''The smoke was like, you couldn't see in front of your face,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the room the door was shut, so I ended up kicking the door
in and climbed out a window to a verandah. But there were bars on
the window, about a foot and a half by a foot, so I shoved by
friend through and she got pulled out and then some of the firemen
yanked me out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the building collapsed in the blaze, and charred debris
and the threat of falling walls were hampering authorities' ability
to search the site and investigate the cause of the fire, Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors interviewed at the scene said they could not
remember hearing a fire alarm. Wright said it was too early to say
whether fire security at the hostel was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Childers, a town of 1,500 people, relies on backpackers looking
for pocket money to pick vegetables and other produce from nearby
farms. As many as 500 backpackers a day descend on local farms
during the picking season, including some staying in surrounding
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Trevor said he was among farmers who had hired
backpackers, using them as pickers on his zucchini farm. ''Sadly, I
just found out that two of my workers yesterday were among those
killed,'' Trevor told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Heidrich, the editor of the town's newspaper, was one of
the first on the scene, and said terrified survivors were in shock
when he got there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The residents who had been evacuated were sitting across the
road watching the hostel burn,'' Heidrich told the ABC.

Texas Inmate Graham Executed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Gary Graham, subject of the most contentious Texas
death penalty case since Gov. George W. Bush began running for president, was
executed Thursday night after putting up a struggle and insisting he was
innocent of a 1981 murder. Graham, 36, received a lethal injection for the
killing of a man in a holdup outside a Houston supermarket. The state parole
board and appeals courts rejected his arguments that he was convicted on shaky
evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a poor job. Bush
said he supported the execution and pointed out that Graham's case had been

Report: Israel Ready for Concessions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel is prepared to give the Palestinians part of

   DENVER (AP) -- Fires that burned 21,000 acres in Colorado's foothills were
close to being controlled Thursday, although crews continued to monitor hot
spots and watch for flare-ups. Firefighters also were on standby in Grand
Junction, Pueblo and Durango in case any new wildfires erupted. Thirty-nine of
Colorado's 63 counties had fire restrictions Thursday because of the dry
conditions that helped fuel the fires southwest of Denver and east of Rocky

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday that, despite
her denials, there is ''substantial evidence'' that Hillary Rodham Clinton
played a role in White House travel office firings, but the prosecutor said he
won't bring charges because there's not enough evidence to convict the first
lady. The announcement comes less than six months before the 2000 election. Mrs.

The agreement came as the Senate voted 95-4 to endorse a $13.4 billion foreign
aid bill. The legislation contained just under $1 billion in anti-narcotics
assistance to Colombia. However, under the new agreement that amount will now be
increased to $1.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> State Assembly holds off on casino gambling bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Assembly decided late Thursday -
supposedly the last day of the regular 2000 session - not to take
any action on a measure requiring legislative and local
authorization before Indian tribes can open gambling casinos on
non-tribal lands in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members planned to reconvene Friday morning, but aides
said it was unclear whether the casino gambling bill would be
brought to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators on Thursday chose not to take up the bill after a
key supporter of the measure, Assemblyman Jacob Gunther, a Democrat
from Sullivan County, asked the Democrats in the majority for a
four- to five-month delay.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill last week and Assembly passage would
have meant final legislative approval. Gov. George Pataki would
still have had to approve it for the bill to become law, and he had
expressed some concerns with one provision.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would apply to construction of new casinos on
off-reservation lands once they are approved by the federal
government. It would also prevent the state's governor from
exerting executive authority over casino construction.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther apparently withdrew his support after extensive lobbying
by Arthur Goldberg, CEO of Park Place Entertainment, the world's
largest gambling company. Park Place had signed an agreement with
the tribal leaders of the St. Regis Mohawks to build a casino in
Sullivan County and viewed the legislation as a potential delaying
factor to its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day Thursday, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver had
expressed optimism that the legislation would be brought to the
floor and passed by his chamber, saying: ''We will have it on the
calendar today.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver told Albany radio station WROW-AM that the Democrats in
the majority in his chamber ''overwhelmingly'' said during a
closed-door meeting last week that they favored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has the support of casino magnate Donald Trump. The New
York billionaire sees the Legislature as a potential obstacle to a
proposed St. Regis Mohawk Casino in Sullivan County, which could
compete with Trump's Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawks received federal approval to build a casino on the
Monticello Raceway, about 90 miles northwest of New York City. But
it was uncertain what would become of that deal after Mohawk tribal
leaders signed the separate agreement for a Catskill resort not on
the raceway with Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports said Goldberg told lawmakers he has a billion
dollars that could be spent on buying land - including the raceway
- for the proposed casino and asked for a few more months to prove
his interest in investing in the county.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Park Place said, ''Mr. Goldberg is 100
percent committed to the project'' and that the company is
''confident that the Assembly will recognize the benefits to New
York state and Sullivan County of having a resort gaming
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Karr, chairman of the Sullivan County-based Coalition
Against Casino Gambling, also expressed doubts about the measure,
but for a different reason. He said the measure would make it
''less difficult'' to get casinos approved because lobbyists would
be hard at work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would effectively make an end run around the constitutional
requirement for a (statewide) referendum,'' Karr said. ''The
gambling lobbyists have demonstrated sufficient power that I don't
see the Legislature as a safeguard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's casino gambling bill is similar to a measure
proposed by Pataki in March, with one exception - there is no
mention of slot machines. One of the key provisions in Pataki's
proposal was to legalize slot machines in casinos as long as the
state receives 25 percent of the revenues from the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional slot machines are illegal under New York's
constitution, but Pataki has said that it isn't clear whether the
ban on slots applies to Indian casinos. He said that his bill would
have cleared up those issues.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also said he'd have ''reservations'' about
signing into law a casino bill without slots.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan County Legislature Chairman Raymond ''Rusty'' Pomeroy,
who supports building a Catskill resort but is against requiring
legislative approval, said the governor's bill would have also
''created an obstruction'' but at least ''solves a problem'' with
revenues from slots.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (the Legislature's) bill just creates problems,'' Pomeroy
said. ''I don't think the bill's necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: 'I Think Too Much'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore says thinking too hard is one of his
weaknesses and wife Tipper jokes about having had a ''full-time
career working psychologically with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, also admits in
an interview for ABC's ''20/20 Friday'' what many believe is true:
''I'm not a natural, back-slapping politician.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But you know, when the campaign gets going, I do enjoy it. I
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name his greatest weakness, Gore said it is that he's
too cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think sometimes I turn too much to my head ... in the sense
of trying to think through problems,'' he said in the interview
airing Friday night. ''And Tipper's taught me over the years to
feel the emotional dimension of the challenges that we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore said she always thought she'd realize a career
counseling children, for which she earned a master's degree. But,
''I have found that I have had a full-time career working
psychologically with this guy,'' she joked as Gore laughed.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she doesn't really read newspapers or watch
television.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also endured some ribbing about his reputation for
exaggerating and his claim to have created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that some of the stories about exaggerations are,
themselves, exaggerations,'' he said. ''What I said was that when I
was in the Congress, I took the lead on the policies ... in
creating the Internet, which was a mistake. I shouldn't have said
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he invent the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not, and I wish I hadn't managed to give the impression
that I did, either.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki and lawmakers in agreement on gun violence  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mandatory trigger locks and ballistic
''fingerprinting'' are two of the gun control provisions contained
in legislation agreed to Thursday by Gov. George Pataki and
legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also raise the legal age for purchasing
handguns in New York state from 18 to 21 and require background
checks on gun buyers at all gun shows in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate passed the legislation 39-20 Thursday night and
the state Assembly was expected to follow suit when it reconvenes
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called the gun bill ''historic'' and said he hoped other
states and the federal government use it as a blueprint for their
efforts to control guns.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said it shows that states can strike the
''appropriate balance'' between protecting the rights of citizens
not to be harmed by gun violence and the rights of sportsmen and
others who have legitimate reasons to have guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great day for New York,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece, dubbed the ''Gun DNA'' program by the
governor, would require New York handgun dealers and manufacturers
who sell to dealers in the state to submit shell casings from the
test firing of guns in their inventories to the state police's
forensic lab. Computerized images of the casings would serve as
''fingerprints'' for firearms and be kept on file.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would check the database against bullets and casings
recovered at scenes of gun violence to track the guns. The barrels
of guns leave telltale markings on bullets and shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
bullet samples for the government, contending that it is a
preliminary step toward national gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require any person or firm that sells
firearms to provide at the time of sale a trigger locking device.
Businesses selling firearms in New York would also have to post
notices regarding the use of trigger locks and safe storage of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would ban all assault weapons listed
under a 1994 federal law and makes it a Class D violent felony -
punishable by up to seven years in prison - to possess or sell any
banned assault weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the proposal on background checks would close a
loophole in the federal Brady Law which requires that gun sales by
federally licensed firearms deals must be accompanied by a
background check. Sales at gun shows currently do not require such
checks, however, unless the firearms are sold by a federally
licensed dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic senators who voted in favor of the bill said the
legislation did not go far enough, including the provision for a
statewide gun licensing program and a child access prevention
measure. The state's assault weapons ban was also not expanded to
include ''post-ban'' weapons, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a positive step, but we're doing nothing more than
taking the federal definition of weapons. We're not dealing with
the crime of after-ban weapons,'' said Sen. Richard Dollinger, a
Rochester Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor first unveiled the ballistic
fingerprinting program and other proposed measures in March. Most
of the provisions have been supported in the past in some form by
the Democratic-led Assembly. But the Republican Senate had not,
prior to Thursday, approved any of the anti-gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of the bill include:
</P>
<P>
   - A program would be created within the Division of Criminal
Justice Services to prevent guns from illegally entering the state.
</P>
<P>
   - All stolen guns would be required by law to be reported to
police within 24 hours of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   - Penalties would be established for individuals barred from
possessing firearms who illegally attempt to purchase weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Also late Thursday, the state Senate approved a bill that would
require a rating system for video games and prohibit access to
certain games - especially those depicting lifelike death and
injury by the ''firing'' of guns - to youths under 18. It would
also establish an advisory council on interactive media and youth
violence and a parent-teacher anti-violence awareness program and
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Michael Balboni, R-Nassau, said
the current rating systems are inconsistent.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty To Follow Bush  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gary Graham may be dead, but debate over
capital punishment will shadow Texas Gov. George W. Bush's White
House bid because his home state is scheduled to execute an average
of one man a week through Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has shrugged off doubts about the fairness of the justice
system, saying he knows of no innocent person executed in the
state. And he attributes the case's international attention to the
''emotionality'' of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize there are good people who oppose the death
penalty. I've heard their message and I respect their heartfelt
point of view,'' Bush told reporters in a statement near his suite
in the Capitol, as Graham was being removed from his cell and
prepared for execution in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was resolute in his support of the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''After considering all the facts, I am confident justice is
being done,'' he said. ''May God bless the victims, the families of
the victims and may God bless Mr. Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham at that point had minutes to deliver an angry diatribe
against capital punishment before being put to death by lethal
injection. At 8:49 p.m., his case was over.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush runs for president, he remains governor of a state
that has put more people to death in the last two decades than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of the furor over how the death penalty is meted
out in Texas is a window into his personality, giving voters a
preview of how he might deal with the nation's weightiest public
policy decisions, if he wins the White House, political analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someday, he might have to push a button that doesn't just fry
an individual but says, 'We are at war,''' said Marc Landy,
chairman of Boston College's political science department. ''The
issue with Bush is not does he have the guts to do it but is he a
judicious, thoughtful, mature leader?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's body language, rhetoric and demeanor in dealing with the
case gives voters a glimpse of his personality and character, added
Benjamin Page of Northwestern University. Bush was criticized for
laughing during a televised debate when asked about a pending
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the question of basic brainpower but also the question of
basic humanity and depth of feeling,'' said Page, a political
science professor. ''This issue is a keyhole into his character.''
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty protesters dogged Bush during a three-day swing
through Washington state and California this week, but he didn't
flinch. On Friday, Bush returns to the campaign trail for a day
trip to Alabama to raise money and tout his education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bush waited until Graham's appeals were completed
before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   He's said repeatedly he believes none of those put to death on
his watch were executed in error. But a majority of Texans believe
an innocent person has been put to death, according to a poll
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripps Howard Texas Poll found that 57 percent believe
someone has been mistakenly executed. Also, 87 percent said
death-row inmates should have access to free DNA tests to try to
prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Texans, however, continue to strongly support capital
punishment, with 73 percent of those surveyed favoring the death
penalty. A recent Gallup Poll showed that support nationally for
capital punishment has fallen to 66 percent, its lowest level since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those numbers and a moratorium on executions in
Illinois, Bush is sticking to his belief that executions ''save
lives'' as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a death penalty supporter and Bush's
Democratic presidential rival, declined to comment on the Graham
case, saying he did not know the details. But he renewed his praise
of Republican Gov. George Ryan for imposing the moratorium in
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Assembly, Senate enter home stretch of 2000 regular session  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Legislature and Gov. George Pataki
pledged Thursday to enhance penalties for sex criminals, including
those who use ''date rape'' drugs and for repeat child molesters.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the ''vile'' acts of sex offenders make them among
the most dangerous individuals in society. They should be punished
accordingly, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had insisted in recent weeks that he would hold out on
sex-crime legislation until he got agreement on significant
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is real. This is very real,'' he said late Thursday. ''It
does have teeth. Finally, we will bring our sexual assault laws
more in line with the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was quickly adopted by the Republican state Senate and
sent to the Assembly, where Speaker Sheldon Silver said it would
win final legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The sex crime measure was one of the linchpins of the
last-minute negotiations among Pataki, Silver and Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno on Thursday, when legislative leaders started
what they said would be the last meeting of their 2000 regular
session.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno stuck to that timetable, finishing his chamber's session
and leaving Albany for good after 2 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger and more contentious Assembly planned to return
Friday at about 9 a.m. to complete its work, possibly until the
next legislative session begins in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of this year's last-minute legislative drive
for adjournment was a gun-control package, a measure designed to
deter violence in public schools and a bill targeting bigotry
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative sources said a hate crimes bill was agreed to
Thursday, but was being held up by a spat over how much credit each
chamber should get for the measure. Both houses approved the bill
early Friday morning, with the Senate passing it 47-12, and the
Assembly 121-24.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes legislation would boost penalties for more than
50 kinds of crimes if it can be proven that an offender committed
the crime on the basis of the victim's personal characteristics
such as the race, religion, gender or sexual preference. Those
found guilty of hate crimes would be sentenced to penalties a step
higher than their offenses would normally carry.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the sex-crime reform package are
provisions to toughen penalties for use of so-called date rape
drugs which are employed by assailants to render victims
unconscious when the chemicals are slipped into drinks. Attackers
would face consecutive sentences for use of the drugs and for any
sex crimes they committed with the aid of the substances.
</P>
<P>
   The reform package would also create a new crime of ''forcible
touching'' - the fondling of sexual or intimate parts of a victim
for the purpose of degrading or abusing them. That would be
designed to deal with situations like the accosting of more than 50
females in Central Park after the Puerto Rican Day parade in
Manhattan earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The package would also institute a
''two-strikes-and-you're-out'' provision to enhance and make
mandatory penalties against repeat child molesters starting with
their second conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties will also be heightened against sex offenders who
accost young victims or those who are mentally disabled or
incapacitated, Pataki and legislative leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor called the sex assault reform ''really dramatic and
sweeping.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clearly the most important change in sex assault laws in
30 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in Albany, negotiations over the most-watched issues
before the Legislature as a session wound down took place in
private, mostly among high-level staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Silver insisted Thursday his Democratic members were kept up to
speed about the most important bills and how the measures have
evolved in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a general recognition (among state leaders) that
things get done sometimes when people talk to each other outside
the glare of the public,'' Silver told Albany radio station WROW-AM
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As far as how much New Yorkers know about issues under
negotiation, Silver said, ''the public really hasn't been deprived
of any rights'' in private bargaining sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also gave final approval Thursday to two traffic
safety measures aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   One calls for children under age 16 to wear seat belts when
riding in the rear of a car in New York. The other would require
some delivery trucks to be equipped with an electronic monitoring
device or one or more cross-view backup mirrors. Those mirrors are
designed to let drivers see directly behind the bulky vehicle.

<HEADLINE> President Begins Money Marathon  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- President Clinton, his party's fund-raiser in
chief, began a three-day money marathon Thursday with a warning
that even in the face of record budget surpluses, the good times
can't roll forever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing lasts forever; nothing bad, nothing good,'' Clinton
told a Democratic audience in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   First in Phoenix, then in San Diego, Clinton warned that huge
budget surpluses may not materialize. He declared that since that
is the case, the huge tax cuts and spending programs proposed by
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential
candidate, are imprudent and risky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say again, this surplus is projected,'' Clinton said, at a
fund-raiser for Susan Davis, a California state legislator who is
running for Congress. ''We don't have this money yet. How in the
world can we give it away?''
</P>
<P>
   And at every speech Clinton tried various versions of this line:
''You don't have to go out and say anything bad about the
Republicans; all you have to do is tell the truth about the
differences between the two parties. And if you tell the truth and
the people listen, the Democrats will win.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has been doing with heightened rhetoric in recent days,
Clinton took several swipes at the tax cuts favored by
congressional Republicans and Bush, the presumptive GOP
presidential candidate,
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question it will be very appealing for the
Republicans, beginning with the nominee for president, to say,
'Hey, vote for us and we'll give you a tax cut worth over a
trillion dollars over the next 10 years and we can easily afford it
because we're going to have such big surpluses,''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is much more prudent, and would not spend
money he might not have, Clinton continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is, you don't know any more than I do whether we're
going to have all that money over the next 10 years,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president made the same point before leaving the White House
on Thursday morning, even as he noted with satisfaction that
estimates of the nation's already soaring budget surpluses are
projected to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told The Associated Press that Clinton will soon
announce a projected surplus of $1.9 trillion over the next decade.
Clinton himself used that figure in passing in another political
speech in Washington on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because some economist says we're going to have $1.9
trillion over the next 10 years doesn't mean it's going to
happen,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is more than double the $746 billion the
administration projected in February. The figures exclude Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned 11 speeches in Arizona and California, all but
one of them fund-raising pitches, before returning to Washington on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   His back-to-back appearances at a reception and lunch at a posh
hotel in Phoenix were expected to raise $500,000 for the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC will reimburse the government for Clinton's travels and
pay the cost of a first-class airplane ticket for White House staff
accompanying him, said DNC spokesman Rick Hess. It is a payment
system instituted during the Reagan presidency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever the president travels outside Washington, D.C., to
raise money for the DNC, the DNC is fully responsible for paying
the U.S. government the costs of transportation in accordance with
government rules,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Trucker Charged in 58 Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By MAUREEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Dutch driver of a truck in which 58 Chinese
illegal immigrants died in an airtight compartment faces charges of
manslaughter, and police are interrogating four other people in an
effort to uncover the organizers of the disastrous smuggling
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   With victims' relatives in Britain -- themselves illegal
immigrants -- fearing to come forward, police are still trying to
identify the bodies that were found in the back of the truck with
two survivors when it arrived in the port of Dover off a ferry from
Belgium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's driver, Perry Wacker, 32, from the Dutch city of
Rotterdam, appears in court Friday, a day after being charged with
58 counts of manslaughter. He was also charged with smuggling the
two survivors and attempting to smuggle the dead victims.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster prompted an international police hunt for criminal
gangs who run lucrative smuggling rings, bringing to the West
burgeoning numbers of illegal immigrants from Asia, Eastern Europe
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims apparently came from China's southern Fujian
province, notorious for ''snake heads,'' the gangs responsible for
the human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Wacker has been held since the truck was seized in Dover. Kent
police are also holding two London-based Chinese suspected of
involvement in the smuggling gang. In the Netherlands, police have
arrested the 24-year-old owner of the trucking company, and an
unidentified 55-year-old man, who British newspapers reported was
Wacker's father.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail newspaper on Friday quoted the lawyer for Arie
van der Spek, the trucking company's owner, as saying his client
had no knowledge of the illegal migrants and was devastated by news
of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Spek was recruited in Rotterdam last week by two men
whose identities he did not know, said the lawyer, J.H. Van Meurs.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies on the victims completed Thursday showed the 54 men
and four women, all in their 20s, died of respiratory failure due
to asphyxiation, officials said. They had been sealed in the back
of the truck, which took a five-hour ferry voyage from Zeebrugge,
Belgium, the vehicle's cooling system turned off on one of the
hottest days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two survivors, who left hospital under police guard for a
safe house and have started talking to police, are key to helping
trace the racketeers and to identifying their dead companions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two young men, who both suffered dehydration and
shock, was found still breathing under the bodies of his
compatriots, said a police source cited by The Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives in Britain who may be able to identify the
dead have been slow to come forward for fear of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Five illegal Chinese immigrants in Britain have told lawyers
they are sure relatives were in the truck and want to get residence
permits in exchange for helping identify the bodies, their
attorney, Wah-Piow Tan, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry charged that Western
countries encouraged racketeers by granting political asylum, but
also pledged to crack down on snake heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain countries should learn from this tragedy,'' spokesman
Zhu Bangzao added.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair met Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao,
who was on a routine visit to Britain, and urged better
British-Chinese cooperation, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that the victims were part of a group
detained in Belgium in April and later released without escort.
However, Britain's Sky television reported Thursday that police
fingerprinting indicated the victims were not from the same group.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgian Interior Minister Antoine Duquesne told
lawmakers that police did not check the truck at all before it left
Zeebrugge.

<HEADLINE> North Dakotans Sick of Rain  </HEADLINE>
By BLAKE NICHOLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakotans traditionally usher in
summer by opening umbrellas instead of sunscreen. But after a week
and a half of damaging heavy rains and flash flooding, waterlogged
residents welcomed a chance to dry out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's constantly gloomy,'' Daniel Kouba, a farmer in
northeastern Walsh County, said Thursday. ''Today we see the sun,
and we are in our glory.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota officials plenty of practice in dealing with the
aftermath of floods -- this is the eighth straight year the state is
seeking a federal disaster designation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's good news and bad news,'' said Gov. Ed Schafer. ''The
bad news is ... it's difficult. People's lives are affected. Their
incomes are affected. It's a very tough issue to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the good news side is, we've been dealing with it ever
since shortly after I was elected (in 1992), and we've got a lot of
experience in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Walsh and Pembina county commissions
declared a drought emergency after two months of little
precipitation. Since then, nearly 5 inches of rain has fallen in
the area, flooding out some crops and hay land.
</P>
<P>
   In Fargo, a downpour earlier this week dropped 7 inches of rain
in 6 hours. Last week, some parts of Grand Forks County reported 20
inches of rain over two days.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding has plagued various parts of the state since 1993, much
of it around Devils Lake, a closed basin in north-central North
Dakota. The lake has risen nearly 25 feet since 1992, gobbling up
roads and fields and causing millions of dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's worst disasters was in 1997, when a winter of
severe blizzards followed by Red River flooding forced the
evacuation of Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies finally arrived in flood-stricken areas Thursday,
but in many cases, the wind kept people indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a little slow -- about half of what we're used to,''
said Ardis Aasen, owner of Apple Grove Golf Course in Minot. ''I
don't like that kind of weather. I thought we were going to get
blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain last week forced officials to close the course for two
days, Aasen said.
</P>
<P>
   In Grand Forks, pizza delivery driver Todd Thompson was enjoying
the break from the wet weather, which he said makes driving harder
and more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets to be kind of old after a while,'' he said Thursday.
''Traffic will tend to slow down somewhat, some streets start to
fill up. This is the first sunny day since last Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather pattern that brought the soggy conditions to the
state is typical for this time of year, said Len Peterson, a
National Weather Service technician in Bismarck.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the jet stream moves farther north and allows moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico to meet with cooler Pacific and Canadian
air, producing severe storms that bring floods.
</P>
<P>
   ''On average, it's our wettest time of the year,'' Peterson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bismarck, rain fell every day but one between June 9 and 19,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Emergency Manager Doug Friez said he could understand the
frustration with the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is, how long can this go on?'' Friez said earlier
this week. ''It's tough on people, it's tough on their way of life,
and it's tough on the economy of the state.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton faces fresh reminder of White House scandals  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New Yorkers weighing the U.S. Senate
candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton have a fresh reminder of the
scandals that have dogged her husband's presidency and her possible
involvement in them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obviously unwelcome news for her campaign,'' said New
York pollster Lee Miringoff on Thursday after independent counsel
Robert Ray said there is ''substantial evidence'' the first lady
played a role in White House travel office firings, contrary to her
denials.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ray said he won't bring perjury charges against
her.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans said the Ray report couldn't help but hurt
Clinton's campaign while Democrats said it was not likely to have
any impact.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Thursday, Ray said he could not prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that ''any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and
testimony regarding her involvement in the travel office firings
were knowingly false.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray issued the statement after closing out the investigation
into the 1993 firings of all seven employees of the White House
travel office, which spurred one of the first major controversies
of President Clinton's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Clinton's Republican Senate rival, Rep. Rick
Lazio, refused to comment on Ray's statement. But other New York
Republicans said the travel office report would hamper the first
lady's run even if the GOP doesn't flog it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's got legs of its own,'' New York state GOP
Chairman William Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, independent pollster Miringoff noted that while Ray's
actual report is sealed for at least 90 days, that means there
could be a new round of news reports on it come early autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes out in September, the Clinton people will say
it's old news, but for those suffering from a heavy bout of Clinton
fatigue it's more of the same,'' said the head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to lose the election for her, but it's not a
plus. The biggest problem is that it reinforces a major existing
negative for her,'' said Jay Severin, a New York Republican
political operative and television commentator. ''It's a major
reminder that she appears to be among those who look like they're
above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin theorized it might have been better for Clinton's
campaign if Ray had said he would seek to indict the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''She always does better when she's a victim,'' said the GOP
strategist, who is not involved in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope, a major booster
of the first lady's Senate run, said the Ray report would have no
impact on the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically no news,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty million dollars, six years later, the report confirms
what Hillary has said all along, that she did nothing wrong ... The
operative sentence to me is that the evidence was insufficient to
prove to a jury that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements were
knowingly false,'' Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran New York Democratic operative Hank Sheinkopf agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saying somebody is heavily involved and calling them a crook
is entirely different ... There is no hard proof that can wind up
on a television commercial that says in fact she did something
wrong,'' said Sheinkopf, who is not involved in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said he also didn't
believe Ray's report would affect the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers have made up their minds about this a long time
ago and they know there's no there there,'' the Clinton aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby shared that view, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who hate her will say, 'This is why we hate her,' and
those who love her will say, 'Why don't they leave her alone?'''
Zogby said. ''I don't think it amounts to anything.''

<HEADLINE> Green Party To Nominate Nader  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Delegates to the Green Party National Convention
are meeting this weekend to nominate Ralph Nader as their candidate
for president, hoping he can provide the party with the higher
profile it needs to make significant inroads in states where their
issues play well.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a lifelong consumer advocate, concedes it will be
difficult to break the monopoly Republicans and Democrats have on
the White House and is looking for a bigger prize.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to use his increasing clout to push favored issues,
such as election reform, health care and fighting what he says is
the concentration of power in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, could give the party more power in the United
States than in Europe and other countries where Greens hold office.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have a lot more leverage in this country in another
way and that is by determining the margin of victory between
Democrats and Republicans,'' Nader said in a telephone interview
from the campaign trail. ''It's not a spoiler role, it's a leverage
role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is Gore worried about California? Because it's a
winner-take-all, whereas in Germany you wouldn't be worried about a
Green thing because if they got 5 percent, that's all they get,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Field Poll of California voters released Tuesday showed Nader
doing better than expected, drawing 7 percent support. That could
benefit George W. Bush, the Republican presidential contender, and
hurt Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee and the
subject of Nader's attacks on Democratic environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led Bush, 46 percent to 35 percent, among California's
likely voters. But the vice president led 51 percent to 41 percent
in the same poll in late February.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also did better than Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan,
who drew 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Backers hope his name recognition from decades of consumer
advocacy will help them advance items on their agenda, especially
election reforms such as instant runoff voting that allows voters
to rank their choices of candidates for office, forcing winning
candidates to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda also includes universal health insurance, gay and
lesbian rights, social justice, environmental protection, labor
rights and promoting renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nader was the Green Party presidential candidate last time
around, but did not actively campaign. This time, he says he has
visited most states and plans a vigorous fight.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schmidt, Green Party platform chairman, said 1996 was a
''symbolic campaign'' to give the Greens time to get organized and
learn the ropes of getting on the ballots of all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were things that we needed to put in order. We've done
that,'' he said. ''Now Ralph Nader is running ahead of Pat
Buchanan, we're pulling close to double digits in California, and
we are raising millions of dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Resenbrink, a former political professor and a founder of
the Green Party in this country, said the Greens also have suffered
because of an ideological split about 10 years ago that produced
the Green Party USA and the Association of State Green Parties,
which is holding this week's convention. Nader is to be formally
nominated on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The split occurred after some members opted to work within the
existing system and others wanted a more confrontational role, akin
to the violent demonstrations that disrupted the World Trade
Organization meetings in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johann Moore, a member of the Green Party USA, said his members
are reluctantly supporting Nader for president, even though he
rejects violence and isn't a member of either wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We offered to meet with him and he turned us down. It begs the
question of why he is running. He feels he's doing us a favor,''
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he has always been an independent, and does not want
to get involved in Green factional disputes. He said violence is
counterproductive and will not support it.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the Green Party will attract increased attention in
the coming decade because of environmental concerns like global
warming, decreased ozone levels and acid rain, and said the major
political parties will have to have to take note.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to have to reach out or they're going to lose
votes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Life Learning Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore will unveil a $2.3 billion
''lifelong learning'' package featuring tax breaks and community
grants aimed at expanding working training programs, Democrats
familiar with the program said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, to be offered Friday during a symbolic swing
through Silicon Valley, are part of a much larger $40 billion Gore
education package.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time he has presented it as a comprehensive
program,'' said a Democrat who has been briefed on the plan. The
$2.3 billion price tag would be over 10 years, and targeted
specifically at training programs in new high technology fields.
</P>
<P>
   Major proposals include:
</P>
<P>
   --Giving businesses a $6,000 tax credit when they offer workers
certain training programs.
</P>
<P>
   --Offering cities and communities a competitive grant program
when they help structure training programs to upgrade skills for a
specific work force. For instance, a city with an aging industry
that's closing could apply for help assembling a training program
to give workers new skills, a major incentive when cities seek to
lure new businesses. Priority would be given to information
technology training. This would be about a third of the tab.
</P>
<P>
   --Offering grants to states that have aid programs for workers
who are in training between jobs and exhaust unemployment
compensation. Six states currently offer such programs, and the
plan is designed to encourage others by providing a federal match
for any state program.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals would be coupled with proposals Gore has already
offered which would grant a tax deduction for the first $10,000 in
college tuition payments, and to expand that package to tuition
payments for training programs and further expand unemployment
benefits for working in training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals come in the second week of his ''prosperity and
progress tour'' where he's seeking credit for the nation's robust
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president dedicates a portion of his campaign stump
speech to arguing that education and training are the key to
keeping the economy moving because rapidly changing technology
means workers face unprecedented demands to expand their skills.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is key to the election, because Gore is betting that
voters will reward him for the continued solid economy by seeing no
need to change horses. That's a challenge because some polls have
suggested voters have as much confidence in Bush to keep the
economy solid.
</P>
<P>
   That's sparked Gore to launch his high-profile, but much
interrupted, three week tour.
</P>
<P>
   Heading for Silicon Valley in northern California, the heart of
the nation's high-tech industry, underscores that point. Gore
earlier this week spelled out plans to augment the Social Security
system with government payments, spelled out a $1.5 billion special
education proposal.
</P>
<P>
   California is also a crucial state for Gore's hopes, because its
54 electoral votes are about 20 percent of what's needed to win the
election.
</P>
<P>
   No Democrat since Jimmy Carter has won the White House without
winning California.
</P>
<P>
   Next week he has plans to unveil environmental initiatives and
proposals to bolster alternative energy production.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was determinedly upbeat on the campaign trail, joking with
reporters and playfully snatching cellular phones away from a
couple of journalists during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   That brightness was contrasted, however, with a very dark cloud
in Washington where officials confirmed that the latest prosecutor
to look into Gore's fund-raising in the last election has
recommended Attorney General Janet Reno name an independent counsel
to investigate campaign money in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters he was unaware of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Though the timing was awkward, Gore also diverted from his
policy proposals for more fund raising of his own. Stopping at two
private homes in Denver, Gore raised $200,000 at a cocktail
reception and pulled in another $900,000 at a $10,000-a-plate
dinner. For their money, dinner guests got grilled steaks and a
garlic mashed potato dish.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After raising his money, Gore headed for a Hispanic rally and
was headed Friday morning for California.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire To Pay For Transplant  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD GREEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An 18-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis
will get the double transplant she hopes will save her life. She
has a millionaire businessman -- and not the state health plan -- to
thank.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hemstreet, owner of Shilo Inns, will cover the costs --
about $200,000 -- for Brandy Stroeder to get new lungs and a new
liver.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I'm guaranteeing this kid the surgery,''' David
Rogoway, a spokesman for Hemstreet, said Thursday. ''He'll cover
it, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmark Oregon Health Plan, which extends Medicaid coverage
to about 350,000 low-income state residents, has refused to pay,
saying the double transplant is too experimental and too costly.
The state did agree last week to pay for an evaluation to determine
whether Stroeder is a good candidate for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Without the double transplant, Stroeder is expected to die
within two years. Hemstreet's offer lifted her spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's pretty awesome,'' she said from her home in
McMinnville.
</P>
<P>
   Hemstreet initially proposed paying half the cost of the
operation and having the state pick up the other half. He decided
to guarantee full payment after the state declined to participate,
Rogoway said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state can give money to people with drug problems,
pregnant mothers, and such, but this is a human life. Doctors say
this could give her quality life for four more years. That's not
worth something?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. John Kitzhaber, a medical doctor who
created the Oregon Health Plan, called Hemstreet's offer ''a
gracious one.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also defended the health plan, which made Oregon the
first state in the nation to combine state and federal funding to
offer health care assistance to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not within our ability to begin covering experimental
procedures even if we're just cost-sharing on these procedures,''
spokesman Bob Applegate said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Munguia, spokesman for Oregon Health Sciences University,
said the operation costs about $250,000 and Stroeder's family has
raised about $65,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
   Stroeder is to be evaluated for a transplant July 17 at Stanford
University Medical Center, Rogoway said. The evaluation is a
prerequisite for getting on the donor's list.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gehab, vice president for clinic programs at OHSU, said
the average wait for a double transplant could be as long as two
years. If Stroeder becomes sicker, she would move up the list to
receive organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The survival rate for double transplant patients appears to be
about 70 percent -- similar to the survival rates for lung
transplants alone, Gehab said.
</P>
<P>
   Shilo Inns, headquartered in Beaverton, is the largest privately
owned hospitality chain in the West. It operates 48 hotels in
Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Montana,
Utah and Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Voters Asked Offbeat Questions  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Which presidential candidate would you want on
your summer vacation? How about on a date? Who would be more fun on
a night out with the guys?
</P>
<P>
   Women in a couple of recent focus groups said they were more
likely to want a date with Democrat Al Gore; they saw him as more
thoughtful and more likely to show interest in them. Men chose
Republican George W. Bush for a guys' night out; he was seen as
being more fun.
</P>
<P>
   More people in a recent poll wanted to take Bush on vacation.
But participants in a focus group were divided on which one they
would give a ride to in the car pool to work.
</P>
<P>
   The questions may seem strange, even frivolous, to some. But
pollsters says such offbeat questions can be useful in measuring
how candidates connect with the voting public.
</P>
<P>
   ''The importance of the untraditional questions is that they
allow the voter to answer questions on their ground rather than
yours,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who helps conduct the
NBC-Wall Street Journal poll with Republican pollster Bob Teeter.
''To most people, politics is not something they think about. These
help them think about things in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart recalled a focus group in 1984 helped disclose that people
preferred Gary Hart on many fronts, but would trust Walter Mondale
more in a nuclear crisis. That insight led to the development of
effective ads for Mondale's successful campaign for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Offbeat questions are more common in focus groups, where eight
to 12 people give broader answers to questions, providing deeper
insight into their feelings. Unusual questions are sometimes asked
in public opinion polls, where some veteran pollsters view them
more as ''harmless fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fox News recently asked people who they would rather spend
their summer vacation with, almost four of 10 said Bush and just
over a fourth said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Meyer, a 20-year-old administrative assistant from
Marietta, Ga., chose Bush. ''Al Gore seems kind of boring.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Fox News-Opinion Dynamics poll asked who would be more
likely to cheat at cards, respondents were split in thirds among
Bush, Gore and undecided.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was posed three years ago about Al Gore
and President Clinton, by a 3-to-1 margin people said the president
would be more likely to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the poll who worked hardest to get where he now is,
Gore was chosen by 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a candidate before, he had to actually fight a
little to get where he's at,'' said Guillermo DeLeon, a 27-year-old
technician from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups can provide interesting insight into people's
feelings about candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Hart recently asked participants in a focus group, conducted for
C-SPAN, who they'd want as a ''lifeline'' on ''Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire.'' Most, including several Bush supporters, chose Gore
or Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan. Only one participant chose
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Republican pollster Frank Luntz asked GOP-leaning
voters in a South Carolina focus group done for MSNBC what animal
they thought of when they heard John McCain's name. Several said
the Arizona senator reminded them of a lion. One woman said he
reminded her of a lion because he was strong, and a lamb because he
could be gentle.
</P>
<P>
   One participant said Bush reminded him more of a fox. Bush
outfoxed McCain to win South Carolina's brutally competitive
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the role as moderator is late-night talk show host,''
said Luntz, who says offbeat questions help to lighten the
atmosphere for focus group participants.
</P>
<P>
   He said questions that reveal attitudes about personal
attributes are more important this year because the economy is
strong and the nation is at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you ask people routine questions, you get a canned
response,'' he said. ''When you ask them an offbeat question, they
don't know how to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Steinglen, a retiree from Pittsbugh, burst out laughing
when asked in an interview which candidate she would rather spend a
summer vacation with.
</P>
<P>
   Her answer: ''Neither one of them, really.''

<HEADLINE> Korea Tries To End Doctor Strike  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The government put forward Friday what
it called its final compromise proposal to doctors leading a strike
that has virtually shut down South Korean medical facilities,
promising them more financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised to increase prescription fees and
provide more legal protection for doctors to prescribe drugs, a key
demand of protesters. But it rejected another main demand for a
delay in a new industry system that doctors say deprives them of a
major source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's will to enforce the new system on July 1 as
scheduled is firm and immovable,'' Prime Minister Lee Han-dong
said. ''This is a reform system so all should be ready to tolerate
some inconveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   Initial reactions from the striking doctors were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed. The proposal appears to be not much
different from the government's existing position,'' said Sa
Sung-hun, a spokesman for the strike organizer, Korea Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Another association spokesman, Kim Do-suk, said that although
the proposal is not very new, he was ''encouraged by the strong
will shown by the government to address our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical services in South Korean came to a virtual standstill
after most of the nation's 65,000 doctors went on strike Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nearly 90 percent of the nation's 19,000 clinics
and hospitals closed. Hospitals, short of doctors, sent patients
home and delayed surgical operations. There were several deaths
linked to the strike, including a 71-year-old man who died of
asthma after he was unable to see a doctor in time.
</P>
<P>
   It was feared the strike could spread as medical professors,
pressed to man intensive care wards and emergency rooms, threatened
Friday to join in the strike unless the government accepts the
doctors' demands.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute stems from a decades-old system in which the roles
of doctors and pharmacists somewhat overlap. Up to now, doctors
have been allowed to prescribe and sell drugs to patients at a
profit. Pharmacists can also prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government wants to draw a clear line with the new
system, which bars doctors from selling most drugs and requires a
doctor's prescription for pharmacists to sell certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe that most clinics and hospitals in South Korea
would not survive financially under the new system, which they
claim is more generous to pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's proposal, the government said it will review the
system three to six months after it is implemented and rectify any
problems. Doctors say similar government promises in the past were
unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say their prescription fee of $7.20 per person is too
low.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it will gradually raise prescription fees
paid to doctors -- now at $7.20 per person -- but cannot do so
drastically because nearly 60 percent of the fees should be covered
by public insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised to increase its contribution to a
national insurance fund so that doctors can benefit more than now.

<HEADLINE> Governor, lawmakers agree to new gun control measures  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State lawmakers have agreed to adopt new gun
control provisions that would include mandatory trigger locks and
make New York one of the first states to require ''ballistic
fingerprinting'' of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The measures also would raise the legal age for purchasing
handguns in New York from 18 to 21 and require background checks on
gun buyers at all state gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate passed the legislation 39-20 Thursday night and
the state Assembly was expected to follow suit by Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki called the gun bill ''historic'' and said he
hoped other states and the federal government use it as a blueprint
for their efforts to control guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great day for New York,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece, dubbed the ''Gun DNA'' program by the
governor, handgun dealers and manufacturers who sell to dealers in
the state would have to submit shell casings from the test firing
of their guns to the state police's forensic lab. Computerized
images of the casings would serve as ''fingerprints'' for firearms
and be kept on file.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels of guns leave telltale markings on bullets and shell
casings. Authorities would check the database against bullets and
casings recovered at scenes of gun violence to track guns.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has opposed the taking of bullet
samples for the government, arguing that it is a preliminary step
toward national gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday - when legislators started their last meeting of
the 2000 regular session - Pataki and the Legislature agreed to
adopt tougher penalties for sex criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the sex-crime reform package: provisions
to toughen penalties for use of so-called date rape drugs.
Attackers would face consecutive sentences for using the drugs and
for any sex crimes they committed while a victim was under the
influence of the substances.
</P>
<P>
   The reform package also creates a new crime of ''forcible
touching'' - the fondling of sexual or intimate parts of a victim
to degrade or abuse a victim.
</P>
<P>
   The crime would deal with actions such as the attacks on women
in Central Park earlier this month following the Puerto Rican Day
Parade in Manhattan. Dozens of women told police they were doused
with water, chased, stripped, molested, assaulted and even robbed
by roving gangs of men. Several suspects have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> White Zimbabweans Return To Politics  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYATI, Zimbabwe (AP) -- An unspoken compromise governed Zimbabwe
since it gained independence from white-minority rule: Whites could
keep their farms, their businesses, their economic power, as long
as they did not interfere with the ruling party's political
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement lasted nearly 20 years -- until the economy began
a devastating downward spiral that many whites blamed on government
corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with parliamentary elections scheduled this weekend, many
angry whites have plunged back into politics and put their
considerable resources behind the Movement for Democratic Change,
the first major opposition challenge to President Robert Mugabe's
rule since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was tired of our country being run down and I felt I could
do something,'' said Denis Streak, a 50-year-old cattle rancher in
Nyati, about 200 miles southwest of Harare, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though not all whites support the opposition, and the vast
majority of MDC leaders and their supporters are black, newly
politicized whites have become an important component of the
opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   Streak, a former member of the national cricket team, had never
cared about politics. But when the ruling party proposed a new
constitution that would have further strengthened Mugabe's power,
Streak, and many other whites, joined the MDC and campaigned
against its passage.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution's defeat in a February referendum stunned the
government. Almost immediately afterward, thousands of armed ruling
party militants began occupying white-owned farms, demanding the
properties be seized and redistributed to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe agreed and signed a law, which had been rejected in the
referendum, allowing the government to seize the farms without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   He recently has begun demanding blacks have more control of
mines and other businesses in a country where the 0.5 percent of
the population that is white controls a vastly disproportionate
amount of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has seized on many whites' public support of the MDC to
paint the party as a puppet of the whites and Britain, Zimbabwe's
former colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zimbabwe will never be a colony again,'' reads a ruling party
campaign slogan that touches a particularly raw nerve in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   With independence sweeping the continent in the 1960s, Ian
Smith, the white prime minister of what was then Rhodesia, declared
unilateral independence from Britain in an effort to ensure the
continuation of white-minority rule here. Only in 1980 did the
country emerge from 15 years of international isolation and
guerrilla warfare as black-ruled Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   This history has made whites, whose population has since shrunk
from 270,000 to 70,000, an easy scapegoat for the country's ills,
Streak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 20 years they've been blaming everything on us,'' Streak
said. ''It's our fault, the 'no' vote (on the constitution). It's
our fault there is no fuel. It's our fault there is no (hard
currency).''
</P>
<P>
   The white abandonment of politics after independence further
isolated the minority from the rest of the country, said Jim
Sinclair, a white farmer who lives near the town of Norton, 40
miles southwest of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a feeling that whites were not participating in the
country in general, and politics was a part of that,'' said
Sinclair, 63.
</P>
<P>
   However, with little previous opposition to the government, few
people, black or white, took an active interest in politics, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's energized people around the country is that they are
just poorer now than they've ever been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most whites, however, have remained quiet, especially in the
face of political violence that has killed more than 30 people,
mainly opposition supporters, Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't like to make themselves targets, and in the
situation we have now of intimidation and violence no one wants to
put their heads above the parapets unless they are really committed
people,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Impasse Broken on Money For Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-stalled funds may soon be flowing to
support U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, to fortify Colombia's war on
drugs and to help victims of nearly a year's worth of natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Top congressional leaders broke a four-month impasse on Thursday
and agreed to rough outlines of a $12-billion spending package.
They now hope to bring it to the House and Senate for final passage
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Details were still being worked out behind closed doors at
week's end and many of the spending items inside the package
remained vague, said aides to both House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders agreed on several major components -- including a
$1.3 billion anti-narcotics package for Colombia and about $1.5
billion to reimburse the Pentagon for the costs of keeping troops
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also includes millions of dollars in assistance
to help communities and individuals recover from a series of
natural disasters, from last September's Hurricane Floyd to the
recent fires that roared through Los Alamos, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the Los Alamos money could be as high as $500 million. Some if
it would be used to rebuild damaged parts of the government's
nuclear weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
   A catalyst was the Senate's approval of a foreign aid bill
containing President Clinton's Colombia aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a prime sponsor of the Colombia
proposal, called the final 95-4 vote ''a major victory toward
stopping the spread of illegal narcotics into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was rising pressure from the Pentagon, as much as
anything, that appears to have contributed to the spending
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which has been drawing down other accounts to pay
for keeping its troops in Kosovo, has said it will have to start
curtailing activities early next month unless it receives the
Kosovo funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not want such cutbacks blamed on them,
particularly in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders planned to attach the entire $12
billion spending package a popular military construction spending
bill now before a House-Senate conference panel.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton earlier expressed pleasure that the
Colombia package had been endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge, huge issue. And again, I'm grateful to the
Senate, and I'm grateful it was done on such a bipartisan basis.
And we just need to get it done as quickly as possible,'' Clinton
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert hopes the big spending package can be approved by the
House next week, said Hastert spokesman John Feehery. John
Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said a Senate final vote was also
possible next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration for months has been pressing Congress
to finish work on what it considered its emergency spending
package.
</P>
<P>
   It started out as $5.2 billion that Clinton requested in January
for the Colombia package, for U.S. troops in Kosovo and for victims
of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a $13.2 billion version -- called a
supplemental appropriations bill -- on March 30, pumping it up by
adding even more money for the Pentagon and domestic natural
disasters and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, Lott balked at the $13 billion price tag. The
bill was split into three pieces and attached to other spending
bills, with the Colombia money going into the foreign aid measure.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's $12 billion agreement puts the pieces back together
again, with a slightly lower price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate foreign aid bill contained $934 million for Colombia.
But the spending agreement reached by Lott, Hastert and other top
leaders will bring that to $1.3 billion instead.
</P>
<P>
   That's a compromise between the Senate appropriation and the
$1.7 billion that the House earmarked for the measure, which will
go toward training Colombian military troops and providing dozens
of U.S.-manufactured helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Senate foreign aid bill is S. 2522, the House supplemental
appropriations bill is H.R. 3908.

<HEADLINE> Census Director Defends Count  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the face of Republican criticism, Census
Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt voiced confidence over the quality
of work his agency produced but maintained that a sampled count of
the American population was more accurate than an actual head
count.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Thursday of the House Government Reform Committee's
census panel, the chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., said that some
Census Bureau employees may have been pressured by
performance-based incentives, while others took procedural
shortcuts in gathering information.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks before a self-imposed deadline, the Census
Bureau has reached over 99 percent of the country's 120 million
households. Prewitt labeled it the ''good census.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now there is nothing fundamentally wrong with finishing ahead
of schedule, but if quality is being sacrificed, there is,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said the incentive program was not based on how
fast Census 2000 data was collected, but other statistical and
administrative tasks performed by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt testified he was confident that the bureau's
quality-control procedures ferreted out inaccurate information.
Census officials highlighted a bureau office in Hialeah, Fla. where
enumerators are now re-interviewing over 11,000 households after a
procedural discrepancy was found.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we are pleased with progress thus far, there remain
several operations that will improve what already is a good
census,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those operations is ongoing -- a separate, random sample
of 314,000 households from which results will be used to adjust the
raw population count using a statistical method known as
''sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampling supporters say it helps account for segments of the
population missed in prior counts, including minorities, the poor,
and inner-city residents -- groups that tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said the reapportionment of House
seats must be based on raw, non-sampled data. However, it left open
the option for states to use statistically adjusted numbers for
purposes of redrawing political boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In general, GOP leaders favor the raw head count and fear that
using sampled numbers could lead to reshaped districts with higher
concentrations of Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Thursday, Republicans voiced concern that Census
officials were rushing through the count. With about two weeks left
to a self-imposed deadline, the Census Bureau has reached over 99
percent of the country's 120 million households.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get the feeling that if they were slow, (Republicans) would
call it a failed census. Now, since it's moving quickly, you're
calling it a rushed census,'' countered Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New
York, ranking Democrat on the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney was also angered by the House's proposed budget for the
Census Bureau next fiscal year. Dan DuBray, spokesman for Rep.
Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee overseeing Census Bureau funding, said spending being
considered is $48.3 million less than the $719 million the Clinton
administration requested.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau spokesman Steve Jost said the cut could hamper the
agency's collection of economic data, including the Consumer Price
Index and unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Republicans on Thursday also criticized the Justice
Department's response to a lawsuit filed by Virginia over sampled
data. On Monday, Justice asked the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia to dismiss or delay proceedings in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia wants the court to allow the state to use raw Census
2000 numbers for drawing new congressional districts without first
going to the Justice Department for approval, since the state falls
under Federal Voting Rights regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being watched closely by supporters and opponents of
sampling as a benchmark in determining the constitutionality of
sampled data.

<HEADLINE> President Begins Money Marathon  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- President Clinton is sprinting through three
days of Democratic fund-raisers, helping gather the millions of
dollars needed to buy TV time for Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His one break from politics takes him to the U.S. Olympics
Training Center at Chula Vista, Calif., where the president will
pay tribute Friday to athletes preparing to compete for the United
States in Sydney, Australia, this September.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to Los Angeles to raise more campaign money, both
for the vice president's campaign and for Democrats trying to
regain control of Congress after six years of GOP rule.
</P>
<P>
   First in Phoenix and then in San Diego, Clinton took a prominent
cheer-leading role for Gore and jabbed at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's promises to spend the nation's burgeoning projected budget
surplus on tax cuts and favored programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued his warnings amid reports that his administration
will announce next week that new projections show budget surpluses
reaching nearly $2 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The president's message: It's wrong for Bush, the presumptive
GOP presidential candidate, to make lavish spending promises based
on paper projections that may never turn into hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we ought to risk the whole projected surplus on
tax cuts and long-term spending commitments,'' Clinton said of the
Bush proposals as he delivered the day's fourth and final
fund-raising speech at a sit-down dinner here for major
contributors,
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a risky strategy and it's not working,'' Clinton
said. ''We worked a long time to just turn this thing around, and
we don't just want to squander it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I say again, this surplus is projected,'' Clinton said, at an
earlier fund-raiser. ''We don't have this money yet. How in the
world can we give it away?''
</P>
<P>
   At every speech the president tried various versions of this
line: ''You don't have to go out and say anything bad about the
Republicans; all you have to do is tell the truth about the
differences between the two parties. And if you tell the truth and
the people listen, the Democrats will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources told The Associated Press that Clinton will soon
announce a projected surplus of $1.9 trillion over the next decade.
Clinton himself used that figure in his fund-raising speeches in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is more than double the $746 billion the
administration projected in February. The figures exclude Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Before he returns home to Washington on Saturday night Clinton
will have given 11 speeches, all but one of them pitches for
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee is reimbursing the government
for Clinton's travels and will pay the cost of a first-class
airplane ticket for White House staff accompanying him, said DNC
spokesman Rick Hess.
</P>
<P>
   That's the payment system in place for political events outside
of Washington that's been in place since the Reagan administration,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Looking for More Reality TV  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC boss Robert Wright is reportedly upset that,
so far, his network has missed out on the reality TV bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Here's CBS mopping up with ''Survivor'' and, in two weeks,
launching ''Big Brother.'' ABC has just announced something for
next season called ''Mole.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC? So far, nada.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'd like to help. Mr. Wright, here's your next hit: the
reality game show ''Elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Elevator'' (I prefer the name ''Shaft'' but it was already
taken) would travel with a tribe of contestants as they go up and
down in an elevator car, each vying to get voted off by rival
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a grueling competition. Who can make the most witless small
talk? Trample on the most toes? Wear the foulest cologne? Hum the
furthest off-key? After each episode-concluding tribal council
(caution: no torches), the worst offender is then asked to leave
immediately -- or rather, at the next floor.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted with the tagline, ''Many stories will be reached by
'Elevator,''' this show can't miss! And it would be cheap to
produce. Most elevators are already equipped with a security camera
and microphone. Pack 'em in, push Up, and start taping!
</P>
<P>
   Don't like that idea? Here's another, which takes shrewd
advantage of new medical technology. You must have read about the
pill-size video camera that, when swallowed by the patient, makes
its way through the body, transmitting pictures to a tiny wireless
recorder carried on the patient's belt.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Wright, try a little Fox-style flagrancy: NBC presents
''World's Most Amazing Gastrointestinal Tracts!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't like that one either? Well, I can take it elsewhere. Maybe
rejigger it as ''Gallstones Rock!'' for MTV. Or, if Leonardo
DiCaprio would agree to swallow that little gizmo, as an
environmental special for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm plotting a spinoff from those ads for the United
States Mint.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen them, portraying George Washington as more than a
face on a dollar bill. In the two commercials, which promote the
mint's new golden dollar coin, the father of our country is a
modern urbanite whose dollar-bill head is digitally grafted onto a
live-action body.
</P>
<P>
   His face may be greenish, deadpan and always in three-quarters
pose. But thanks to computer wizardry, ''SpokesGeorge'' can move
his mouth and eyes, and he can also speak, blithely assuring us
that he doesn't feel the least bit miffed at getting bumped from
the new coin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Appearing on money isn't my only gig,'' he declares as he goes
about his business riding the subway, teaching an aerobics class,
scuba diving.
</P>
<P>
   Those commercials crack me up. But they also get me thinking. If
George's head lends authority to the anonymous actor in the ads,
consider the benefits of using the same computer voodoo on
well-known TV personalities.
</P>
<P>
   What about Kathie Lee Gifford? Long ago, she could have silenced
detractors who called her a saccharine hypocrite with just a bit of
digital image enhancement: Imagine Kathie Lee's body with the head
of Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kelsey Grammer, fresh from his Broadway flop in the
title role of ''Macbeth,'' may be feeling pretty scarred by that
debacle. How better for Grammer to demonstrate Shakespearian
stature than to film next season's episodes of ''Frasier'' wearing
the head of Sir Laurence Olivier?
</P>
<P>
   And ABC News might continue its mission to reach younger, hipper
viewers with a simple variation on having hired Leonardo DiCaprio
to interview President Clinton: Superimpose Leo's head on Peter
Jennings anchoring ''World News Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, the network denied that the twentysomething megastar
was meant to play the role of a TV journalist for its Earth Day
documentary, which inspired a White House spokesman's wry reference
to ''a quasi-theological debate that's happening at a certain news
organization about what's an interview and ... when is a celebrity
a journalist?''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, that's a good question for Andrea Thompson,
the statuesque blonde from ''NYPD Blue'' who recently gave up her
role as Detective Jill Kirkendall for a role as reporter/fill-in
anchor at Albuquerque's KRQE-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''News has always been a lifelong passion,'' the 40-year-old
actress explained.
</P>
<P>
   But, like everyone in her newly adopted profession, Thompson
could find her days numbered. Soon, Ananova could be breathing down
her neck (assuming Ananova can be programmed to breathe).
</P>
<P>
   Introduced a few weeks ago, this ''virtual newscaster'' is a Web
site oracle, a talking head (literally) in streaming video.
Developed by Britain's Press Association news agency, Ananova has
green hair and a droid-like manner that, by comparison, makes
''Dateline NBC'' anchor Stone Phillips seem as lively as Little
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ananova has no star ego or star salary, and
she'll always be a hottie.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, an artificial presence like Ananova would
be perfect as a host for reality TV.

<HEADLINE> Sick Woman's Citizenship Opposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service has filed court documents formally opposing citizenship for
a severely disabled 24-year-old woman who is unable to understand
or take the oath of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The agency in a brief filed June 16 in U.S. District Court in
Los Angeles said Vijai Rajan, who was born in India, should not be
granted citizenship because she ''has failed to meet the statutory
requirements of the oath of allegiance'' required for
naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   Rajan, who lives in Anaheim, Calif., suffers from cerebral
palsy, muscular dystrophy and other ailments. She uses a
wheelchair, needs 24-hour care and cannot understand, recite or
even raise her hand to take the oath.
</P>
<P>
   Rajan's father, Sunder Rajan, became a naturalized U.S. citizen
in 1980, her mother in 1994. Rajan was born when her mother was
visiting India, while the couple's older daughter was born in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The family sued the INS after Rajan was denied U.S. citizenship
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the INS is now admitting that they are engaging
in discrimination,'' family attorney Philip Abramowitz said
Thursday. ''But they believe their hands are tied by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Two private bills in Congress seek citizenship for Rajan.

<HEADLINE> House Battles Over Tobacco Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With one lawmaker calling cigarette companies
''the least deserving industry in America,'' the House neared its
latest showdown Friday over whether to stifle the federal lawsuit
against the tobacco industry by blocking money for the government's
legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   With a potential settlement worth billions of dollars at stake,
the House prepared to vote on Republican-written legislation that
would prevent the Justice Department from accepting $12 million
from other agencies to help foot the bill for the tobacco action.
Without the money, Attorney General Janet Reno has said her agency
would have to drop the suit, which it filed in September.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco supporters called the lawsuit an election-year,
politically motivated action.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is not about the law, but about the federal
government extorting money from an industry it does not like,''
said Rep. Ron Lewis, R-Ky. ''Which industry will be the next victim
of this punitive action?''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., leader of the effort to thwart
the GOP language, called the tobacco industry ''the least deserving
industry in America,'' saying it had ''targeted our children ...
manipulated nicotine to keep smokers addicted ... deceived and lied
to the public for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton weighed in on Thursday, accusing the cigarette
companies of ''working overtime to pass special protections to
shield them from financial responsibility for the harm they've
caused.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to recover costs the government said it has
incurred from decades of helping Americans with smoking-related
illnesses, a price tag federal officials say exceeds $20 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in a $35.5 billion measure financing the departments
of Commerce, State and Justice would forbid the Justice Department
to accept financial help from other agencies for suits the
government has filed.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman's amendment would exempt suits filed before last Jan. 1,
which he said would affect only one action: the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened a veto because of the tobacco
language and cuts in Clinton proposals for hiring local gun-crime
prosecutors and police officers, legal aid for the poor, and
payments for U.N. peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's bills for the suit are expected to be
$40 million for 2000 and 2001 alone. The department wants the
departments of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and
Defense to contribute $4 million each next year to help pay the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the House voted to block Justice from receiving $4
million from Veterans Affairs, only to reverse itself the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown came as the Senate grappled over legislation on
prescription drugs and worker-protection regulations. Both issues
are more likely to be the stuff of veto fights or campaign
commercials than to be enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate used a mostly party-line 53-44 vote to
reject a Democratic plan for creating a new prescription drug
benefit under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was preordained for defeat in the
Republican-controlled Senate. But Democrats were happy to showcase
their plan and contrast it with a GOP alternative pushed through
the House Ways and Means Committee a day earlier. The GOP package
would subsidize private insurers to encourage them to provide their
own coverage plans.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two Democrats and two Republicans, Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, voted for the
proposal. There were 52 Republicans and Democrat John Breaux of
Louisiana opposed. Not voting were Democrats Barbara Boxer of
California and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, plus Republican Ben
Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan would require participants to pay monthly
premiums of about $35 and a $250 annual deductible. In exchange,
the government would subsidize the costs of purchasing
beneficiaries' drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, the Senate voted 57-41 to block proposed
Clinton administration rules that would require employers to take
extra steps to prevent repetitive motion injuries in the workplace.
The rules are expected by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the regulations could prevent many of the 1.8
million such injuries that occur every year. But Republicans said
the rules would be too expensive, are not based on sound science
and might usurp state worker compensation laws.
</P>
<P>
   The approved language would block the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration's proposed rules until October 2001 -- after
Clinton has left office.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a bill with similar language two weeks ago.
The White House has threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, John Breaux
of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas supported blocking the
new rules. The only GOP defector was Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Inouye missed the vote.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher in Early Going  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today, bouncing back from
Thursday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening minutes of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 44.54 at 10,420.66.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 6.02 at 1,458.20, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 19.61 at 3,956.45.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Micron Technology Inc. rose $1.313 to $87.188 Friday
after the computer chip maker reported third-quarter earnings that
came in well ahead of expectations. The report after the close of
trading Thursday marked the third straight quarter of strong
profits following two years of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   That provided investors with evidence that the slowing U.S.
economy wasn't eating away terribly at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have worried that the six interest rate hikes by
the Federal Reserve in the last year will not only cool down the
pace of the economy and keep inflation under control, but will also
hurt profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Trading is expected to be somewhat light Friday ahead of the
Fed's meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss interest-rate
policy. Economists are offering mixed options on whether it will
raise rates again, but investors are still bracing for the Fed to
act again to further keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.35 to $20.625 in early
trading after it announced that it was being bought for $1.6
billion in cash and stock ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy
Choice, Butterball, Orville Redenbacher, and Swiss Miss brands.
International Home Foods owns Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and
Gulden's Mustard.

   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with technology stocks
coming under selling pressure for the second straight day as
investors locked in profits following a weeks-long runup.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 27.22 at 10,403.34.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.51 at 1,452.69, and the
Nasdaq composite index was down 44.84 at 3,892.00.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signals that the economy has been slowing in
response to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the last year,
traders are hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed
may still move to tighten credit further to keep inflation in
check.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investors are concerned that the slowing U.S.
economy will eat away at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those concerns were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, were up 87.50 cents Friday morning at $87.50.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus' stock rose $22.563 to $119.688 after the memory chip
maker said that it ended its patent infringement lawsuit against
Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a worldwide licensing agreement on a
variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.35 to $20.625 in early
trading after it announced that it was being bought for $1.6

   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 110.01 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index down 3.00 at 512.01.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.83 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.19 percent,

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Embrace Alternative Care  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Beth Israel Medical Center, a large New York
teaching hospital, this month opened a funky looking facility --
complete with pastel-colored walls and a waiting room with fluffy
couches and a redwood bench -- where physicians work along side
chiropractors and practitioners who specialize in homeopathy and
clinical imagery.
</P>
<P>
   At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the most prestigious
hospitals in Los Angeles, cardiac patients are given the option of
receiving acupuncture or massage therapy after coronary bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, known for its
ground-breaking organ transplants, psychiatrists prescribe herbal
medicines to help patients overcome depression.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, the bastions of Western medicine and high-tech
gadgetry, are increasingly using procedures such as aromatherapy
and Tai Chi to try to attract patients by tapping into one of the
hottest trends in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Though the medical profession remains skeptical about the
effectiveness of alternative therapies, hospital administrators say
they can no longer escape the reality that millions of Americans
routinely use them to complement -- or even take the place of --
traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   About 83 million Americans are spending some $27 billion a year
on alternative care, according to a recent study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   With these patients and dollars in mind, about 13 percent of
U.S. hospitals provide alternative therapies, according to a survey
of about 1,000 hospitals by the consulting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
The figure rises to 25 percent for inner city hospitals and 32
percent for hospitals with at least 500 beds.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, it would have been almost unheard of for hospitals
to offer such services, industry analysts say. That's changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be silly for doctors and hospitals to ignore
something that will be a large part of health care for years to
come,'' said Dr. Matthew Fink, a neurologist who is president and
chief executive of Beth Israel Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and the practitioners of alternative care don't
always mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors still are suspicious of alternative therapies and
consider chiropractors and acupuncturists to be quacks. And health
insurers are reluctant to pay for most alternative procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a move to
affiliate with a group of alternative care practitioners prompted a
firestorm of criticism from faculty members before the program got
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Despite occasional setbacks, alternative care providers and
medical practitioners are increasingly seeking to find common
ground to help their businesses prosper.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening at Beth Israel's Center for Health and
Healing, located on the second floor of a nondescript office
building in downtown Manhattan. The $5 million center, with 17
treatment rooms, has pastel-colored walls. The waiting room is
light and airy with fluffy couches, and there's a bench made from
recycled redwood in the reception area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are providing a wide range of therapeutic options of
remedies that have stood the test of time and/or scientific
scrutiny, and preferably both,'' said Dr. Woodson Merrell, the
center's executive director who is a physician and an
acupuncturist. ''I see integrative medicine as the future of
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, opened in June, includes medical doctors, registered
nurses, nurse practitioners, psychotherapists and practitioners of
acupuncture, chiropractic procedures, mind-body therapy and massage
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel officials opened the center not only to tap into the
growing interest among consumers for alternative care but also to
conduct research to try to determine if these therapies -- some
practiced for thousands of years-- really do work, Merrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said some Beth Israel doctors were suspicious of the
center, especially orthopedic surgeons who are leery of
chiropractors. To win the specialists' support, the center has
agreed that after a patient sees a chiropractor three times, the
case must be reviewed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to get both sides to come to the table to work
together,'' Merrell said. ''It was like putting together disparate
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say alternative care providers gain credibility by
working with physicians and hospitals. And the doctors and medical
institutions are viewed as cutting edge for facilitating
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   Financial barriers remain, however, because there is limited
insurance coverage for alternative procedures. Beth Israel's center
so far has been unsuccessful in attracting an insurer for a pilot
project to test whether alternative therapies can save money and
provide good care, Merrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, support among physicians is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Fontana, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai,
uses acupuncture to relieve the neck pain he develops from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing first hand how the therapy works for him -- and concerned
that his own patients were not receiving effective treatment for
pain -- Fontana recently led a group of physicians to start a pilot
program to test acupuncture, massage therapy and guided-imagery
relaxation techniques on cardiac bypass patients. Early results on
about 100 patients show that nearly all reported some relief from
the services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As my practice evolved, I saw the frustrations of my patients
and came to the realization that Western medicine does not have all
the answers,'' Fontana said.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana's study is just one area at Cedars-Sinai where there is
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital last year launched its Integrative Medicine group,
which offers such services as acupuncture and meditation as well as
physician services. Doctors are becoming involved because their
patients are asking about such procedures, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors fear they will lose patients if they do not know how
to talk to patients about alternative therapies,'' said Dr. Mary
Hardy, the group's medical director who is an internist and
specialist in herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond New York and Los Angeles, hospitals in more conservative
areas of the country also are introducing alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   Central Iowa Health Systems last year opened the Center for
Health and Well Being in West Des Moines, Iowa. The center, which
treats allergies with Chinese herbs and back pain with acupuncture,
hopes the hospital name and logo will attract patients who are
hesitant to give these alternative services a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''We give patients more of a comfort level because they know
we've checked out these practitioners,'' said Sheila Gregan, the
center's director.

<HEADLINE> Indian Designer Shows Couture Line  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Indian couturiere Ritu Beri was ahead of the haute
couture crowd with her showing of lavish clothes at a garden party
Thursday evening, preceding a show next month.
</P>
<P>
   Beri's presentation was a magical moment, almost out of ''A
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' as jeweled, embroidered, silky outfits
strolled down the runway. The occasion was appropriate: the annual
garden party of an exclusive private club, Cercle de l'Union
Interalliee.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne flowed, and the Indian buffet was popular -- with
little samosas, great curries, and other fine Eastern foods, to
rival the tables of excellent French hors d'oeuvres like smoked
salmon and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indian offerings gave a new piquant flavor to this
aristocratic club in a former Rothschild mansion near the American
and British embassy residences.
</P>
<P>
   In her third Paris showing, 30-year-old Beri distinguished
herself for sophistication and opulence. A graduate of the National
Institute of Fashion Technology, which is affiliated with New
York's Fashion Institute of Technology, she showed a fine mixture
of Indian-Western styles in a collection she calls ''melange'' or
mixture, ''that knows no restraints,'' according to her press
release.
</P>
<P>
   A fabulous white lace jacket was paired with lean silk pants,
which many would crave to wear to the exclusive Paris club.
</P>
<P>
   Bare backs or midriffs often had an Indian flavor, along with
flowing jeweled and jewel color skirts, cut on the bias.
</P>
<P>
   Iridescent taffetas, evanescent chiffons and silky velvets were
used wisely in the sumptuous clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The show sparkled like a starry sky with Svarowski crystal
embroideries, or glowing gold-thread embroideries from the atelier
of haute-couture embroiderer Francois Lesage.
</P>
<P>
   So far Beri has sold her couture only in India. But she shows in
several Western countries, and obviously hopes to find a niche
here.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile French and other couturiers are gearing up for the
presentations of fall clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Rosette Mett, the renowned couturiere known as Torrente,
announced she would skip these showings, to present Aug. 3 in Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   According to her press release, she was more than annoyed that
the Chambre Syndicale -- the fashion governing body which plans
schedules -- had given Torrente's favorite early spot on opening day
to Christian Dior, designed by John Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Didier Grumbach, president of the French
ready-to-wear federation and the Chambre Syndicale, announced that
Monday evening he would sign an important agreement of
''partnership'' and cooperation with his Italian counterpart, Mario
Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   This should smooth out the sometimes tempestuous relationships
between the two rival fashion giants -- Paris and Milan.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip shares
rising and technology stocks coming under selling pressure for the
second straight day as investors locked in profits following a
weeks-long runup.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 70.00 at 10,446.12.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.04 at 1,455.22, and the
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was down 35.52 at 3,901.32.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit of the technology stocks was Amazon.com,
which plunged $8.438 to $33.563 after Lehman Brothers fixed-income
analyst Ravi Suria released a research note describing ''extremely
weak and deteriorating'' credit at the online retailing giant.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks falling Friday included Oracle, down
$1.50 at $80, and Yahoo!, off $6.063 at $125.625.
</P>

   The losses in the technology sector were somewhat offset by
gains in the semiconductor shares. Rambus' stock rose $23.125 to
$120.25 after the memory chip maker said that it ended its patent
infringement lawsuit against Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a
worldwide licensing agreement on a variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signs that the economy has been slowing in response
to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the last year, traders are
hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed may still move
to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market hates uncertainty we have a big uncertainty in
front of us,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''When people are
confused on Wall Street, they often keep their hands in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also worry that the slowing U.S. economy will eat away
at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those fears were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, were up 6.25 cents Friday morning at $86.938.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.313 to $20.688 after it
announced that it was being bought for $1.6 billion in cash and
stock ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy Choice, Butterball,
Orville Redenbacher, and Swiss Miss brands. International Home
Foods owns Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and Gulden's Mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.
Manville's shares were up 75 cents to $13.063.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 273.71 million shares
at late morning, down from 309.89 million shares as of the same
time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.41 at 513.60.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Funds for Tobacco Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dealing a blow to the tobacco industry, the
House voted Friday to let the Justice Department have the extra
money it says it needs to pursue the huge federal lawsuit against
cigarette-makers.
</P>
<P>
   With a potential settlement worth billions of dollars at stake,
the House voted 215-183 to let the Justice Department accept $12
million from other agencies to help foot the bill for the tobacco
action. Without the money, Attorney General Janet Reno has said her
agency would have to drop the suit, which it filed in September.
</P>
<P>
   The government filed the suit in hopes of recovering the
enormous costs the government says it has incurred over decades of
coping with millions of senior citizens, veterans, low-income
people and others who have suffered tobacco-related illnesses.
Those costs surpass $20 billion a year, federal officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to deny the extra funds for the department's legal
bills was led by a coalition of Republicans and tobacco-state
Democrats. Thirty-five Democrats joined 147 Republicans in voting
against the money, while 55 Republicans and 159 Democrats voted for
it. The House's two independents split.
</P>
<P>
   Even had the House voted to block the money, the drive would
have faced a questionable fate. President Clinton had called on
lawmakers to keep the litigation alive, and had threatened to veto
the spending bill containing the tobacco provision. In addition, it
is unclear whether the yet-unwritten Senate version of the spending
measure will contain a similar provision.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the issue was fought so hard that Friday's vote was the
third on the matter in the House this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this settles the issue,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., leader of the fight against the effort to deny the extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C., asserted that the legal action is the
White House's way to collect revenue to pursue its political agenda
and said of the vote, ''Emotion triumphed over reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The election-year vote had political overtones as it forced
lawmakers to go on record about an industry that is unpopular among
many voters, but treasured as a major part of the economy in
tobacco-growing regions of the Southeast. Lobbying was heavy on
both sides with tobacco interests pitted against health, veterans
and senior citizens groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is not about the law, but about the federal
government extorting money from an industry it does not like,''
said Rep. Ron Lewis, R-Ky. ''Which industry will be the next victim
of this punitive action?''
</P>
<P>
   But Waxman called the tobacco industry ''the least-deserving
industry in America,'' saying it had ''targeted our children ...
manipulated nicotine to keep smokers addicted ... deceived and lied
to the public for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed in Thursday, accusing the cigarette companies of
''working overtime to pass special protections to shield them from
financial responsibility for the harm they've caused.''
</P>
<P>
   A provision in a $35.5 billion measure financing the departments
of Commerce, State and Justice would have forbidden the Justice
Department from accepting financial help from other agencies for
suits the government has filed.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman's amendment exempted suits filed before last Jan. 1,
which he said would affect only one action: the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had threatened a veto because of the tobacco
provision and cuts in Clinton proposals for hiring local gun-crime
prosecutors and police officers, legal aid for the poor, and
payments for U.N. peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's bills for the suit are expected to be
$40 million for 2000 and 2001 alone. The department wants the
departments of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services and
Defense to contribute $4 million each next year to help pay the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the House voted to block Justice from receiving $4
million from Veterans Affairs, only to reverse itself the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown came as the Senate grappled over legislation on
prescription drugs and worker-protection regulations. Both issues
are more likely to be the stuff of veto fights or campaign
commercials than to be enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate used a mostly party-line 53-44 vote to
reject a Democratic plan for creating a new prescription drug
benefit under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was preordained for defeat in the
Republican-controlled Senate. But Democrats were happy to showcase
their plan and contrast it with a GOP alternative pushed through
the House Ways and Means Committee a day earlier. The GOP package
would subsidize private insurers to encourage them to provide their
own coverage plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan would require participants to pay monthly
premiums of about $35 and a $250 annual deductible. In exchange,
the government would subsidize the costs of purchasing
beneficiaries' drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, the Senate voted 57-41 to block proposed
Clinton administration rules that would require employers to take
extra steps to prevent repetitive-motion injuries in the workplace.
The rules are expected by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the regulations could prevent many of the 1.8
million such injuries that occur every year. But Republicans said
the rules would be too expensive, are not based on sound science
and might usurp state worker compensation laws.
</P>
<P>
   The approved language would block the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration's proposed rules until October 2001 -- after
Clinton has left office.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a bill with a similar provision two weeks
ago. The White House has threatened a veto.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip shares
rising and technology stocks coming under selling pressure for the
second straight day as investors locked in profits following a
weeks-long runup.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 69.65 at 10,445.77.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.58 at 1,453.76, while
the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was down 28.83 at
3,908.01.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit of the technology stocks was Amazon.com,
which plunged $8.75 to $33.25 after Lehman Brothers fixed-income
analyst Ravi Suria released a research note describing ''extremely
weak and deteriorating'' credit at the online retailing giant.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks falling Friday included Yahoo!, off $6
at $125.688.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in the technology sector were somewhat offset by
gains in the semiconductor shares. Rambus' stock rose $22.188 to
$119.313 after the memory chip maker said that it ended its patent
infringement lawsuit against Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a
worldwide licensing agreement on a variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signs that the economy has been slowing in response
to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the past year, traders are
hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed may still move
to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market hates uncertainty and we have a big uncertainty in
front of us,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''When people are
confused on Wall Street, they often keep their hands in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also worry that the slowing U.S. economy will eat away
at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those fears were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, were up $3.063 Friday morning at $89.938.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.375 to $20.75 after it
announced it was being bought for $1.6 billion in cash and stock by
ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy Choice, Butterball, Orville
Redenbacher, and Swiss Miss brands. International Home Foods owns
Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and Gulden's Mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.
Manville's shares were up 81.25 cents to $13.125.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 389.84 million shares
at late morning, down from 446.24 million shares as of the same
time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.09 at 514.92.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Rep. Mineta May Succeed Daley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former California congressman has joined the
White House's short list of contenders to succeed William Daley as
commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Rep. Norman Mineta is being strongly
considered for the post, according to a White House official who
spoke Friday on condition of anonymity. If chosen, Mineta would be
the first Asian-American Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta served 21 years in Congress. He quit in 1995 and became a
senior vice president at Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Daley announced last week he would step down to manage Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign. He is leaving July 15
and his deputy, Robert L. Mallett, will take over in an acting
capacity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Captures Rebel Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) -- The military captured another major
Muslim rebel camp in the southern Philippines on Friday, leaving
the separatist guerrillas with only one remaining stronghold, an
army commander said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have completely taken over Camp Rajamuda,'' said Col.
Hermogenes Esperon, commander of the army's 602nd Infantry Brigade,
in an interview with DXMS radio station.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila, Press Undersecretary Mike Toledo quoted National
Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre as saying the armed conflict
with the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front would be over
in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim rebel groups fighting for
an independent Islamic state in the Philippines. The smaller but
more radical Abu Sayyaf group is holding 21 mostly foreign hostages
on southern Jolo Island. The government -- which considers the Abu
Sayyaf more a group of bandits than a national security threat --
has been negotiating for the safety of those hostages'.
</P>
<P>
   However, the military has seized more than 20 MILF camps since
launching an offensive two months ago and provoking some of the
worst fighting in the impoverished southern Mindanao region in more
than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said only a few
skirmishes were likely in the coming days because ''most of the
MILF's military capability is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation to capture Camp Rajamuda began more than a week
ago and involved about 4,000 soldiers backed by rocket-firing
helicopter gunships, air force bombers and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the massive assault, only four MILF guerrillas and one
soldier were reported killed.
</P>
<P>
   Rajamuda encompassed 16 villages in the southern provinces of
Maguindanao and North Cotabato, said spokesman Maj. Julieto Andoof
of the army's 6th infantry division.
</P>
<P>
   It included a training camp, bunkers and classrooms for
trainees. Soldiers recovered more than a dozen homemade land mines
fashioned from dynamite, some packed in plastic pails with broken
glass and nails.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining MILF fighters are believed to have
withdrawn toward Camp Abubakar, the MILF's headquarters in
Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not announced plans to attack Abubakar, a
sprawling community with farms, schools and a rebel military
academy.
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet committee on national security met Friday in Manila to
discuss the possibility of an ''interim arrangement'' with the
MILF, after the rebels postponed June 28 peace negotiations, Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels could be ''buying time'' to regain strength by
postponing the talks, he said. ''To ensure that they are not buying
time, the military operations continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the government would extend the June 30 deadline for
the talks set by President Joseph Estrada if the rebels ''show
sincerity'' by renouncing their secessionist goals and promise to
stop terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Czechs To Return Jewish Property  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The Czech Senate voted
overwhelmingly Friday to return Jewish property confiscated during
the country's Nazi occupation to its original owners, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Kvetoslava Kozakova said 67 deputies in the 81-seat
upper chamber of the Czech Parliament voted in favor of the motion.
The others either abstained or were absent. The new law that was
already passed by the lower chamber of Parliament on May 24 needs
only the president's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Claims by original Jewish owners or their descendants can be
filed until the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only property the general citizenry lost after the 1948
communist takeover has been returned under existing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have expressed our will to settle the evil legacy of World
War II racial horrors in a dignified and just way,'' CTK news
agency quoted Vice Prime Minister Pavel Rychetsky as saying after
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Jews would receive all land holdings and
buildings confiscated between Sept. 29, 1938, and May 8, 1945, and
that are now owned by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some property, such as land declared a nature reserve or land
under buildings that are not subject to restitution are exempted.
</P>
<P>
   The government previously estimated some 200 state-owned
buildings would be returned. Also, the Jewish Museum in Prague
would receive 63 paintings now in the National Gallery, including
works by Emil Filla, Auguste Renoir and Maurice de Vlaminck.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,500 art objects would be returned to citizens of
Jewish origin or to their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   All property seized by the Nazis was taken over by the
Czechoslovak government that formed after World War II.
Czechoslovakia split peacefully into the Czech Republic and
Slovakia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Jews live in the Czech Republic now, compared to
120,000 before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Czech Cabinet allocated $7.5 million to
set up a foundation to compensate Holocaust victims whose property
cannot be returned.

<HEADLINE> British TV News Must Go On Earlier  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- It's an everyday ritual for millions of Britons --
watching the nightly news before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   But not, according to a British broadcasting watchdog, for
enough millions.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that more and more people are going to bed without their
nightly dose of television news, a broadcasting authority ordered a
long-established commercial network Thursday to switch its main
nighttime news program to an earlier slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Television Commission did not tell the ITV
network what time its news -- now on at 11 p.m. -- should air. But it
told the network to reschedule the program in a bid to stem
hemorrhaging ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the circumstances, we can only insist that the Nightly News
is moved to a time when it is more accessible to viewers,''
commission chairman Sir Robin Biggam said.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, ITV scrapped its flagship News at Ten
after 31 years. The move was condemned by politicians, including
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and lamented in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians were fond of the program, whose timing -- often just
after a parliamentary vote -- gave them plenty of exposure. Viewers
also liked the show and its trusted anchor, the authoritative,
avuncular Trevor McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   But ITV sought a time change to open up a block of prime-time
programming. Previously, movies begun after the nine-o'clock
''watershed'' for adult programming had to be interrupted for the
30-minute newscast. The network argued that news audiences would
remain stable, and perhaps even rise, as audiences tuned in to
uninterrupted films, dramas and live sports events.
</P>
<P>
   It was wrong. While ITV's advertising revenue has soared by a
reported $150 million, the combined viewership for its two evening
news programs -- the nightly news and a dinner-hour broadcast -- has
declined by 2 million since News at Ten went off the air.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision Thursday, the broadcast commission rejected
ITV's proposals to woo back viewers, which included lengthening the
newscast and moving it to 10 o'clock on ''agreed occasions of
national significance,'' such as general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ''ITV is considering its position in the light of the
(commission's) statement and will respond in due course,'' the
network said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has little choice but to comply. The commission,
which licenses and regulates commercial television, has the power
to impose millions of dollars in fines or cut short ITV franchise
licenses if its order is not met.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians who bemoaned the end of News at Ten were pleased
by the decision. Gerald Kaufman, chair of the House of Commons
media select committee, called the commission ''a regulating body
that does its job.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now for ITV to take note of the very strong feeling
across the country and bring back News At Ten,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But fans of News at Ten should not rejoice too soon. If it must
make a change, ITV is thought to prefer a 10:30 time slot.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 62; Dow Gains 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip shares
rising and technology stocks coming under selling pressure for the
second straight day as investors locked in profits following a
weeks-long runup.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 60.81 at 10,436.93.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.64 at 1,447.54, while
the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was down 61.64 at
3,875.20.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit of the technology stocks was Amazon.com,
which plunged $8.563 to $33.438 after Lehman Brothers fixed-income
analyst Ravi Suria released a research note describing ''extremely
weak and deteriorating'' credit at the online retailing giant.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks falling Friday included Yahoo!, off
$7.688 at $124
</P>
<P>
   The losses in the technology sector were somewhat offset by
gains in the semiconductor shares. Rambus' stock rose $17 to
$114.50 after the memory chip maker said that it ended its patent
infringement lawsuit against Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a
worldwide licensing agreement on a variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signs that the economy has been slowing in response
to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the past year, traders are
hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed may still move
to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market hates uncertainty and we have a big uncertainty in
front of us,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''When people are
confused on Wall Street, they often keep their hands in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also worry that the slowing U.S. economy will eat away
at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those fears were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, were up $3.063 Friday at $89.938.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.188 to $20.563 after it
announced it was being bought for $1.6 billion in cash and stock by
ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy Choice, Butterball, Orville
Redenbacher, and Swiss Miss brands. International Home Foods owns
Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and Gulden's Mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.
Manville's shares were up 81.25 cents to $13.125.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 567.45 million shares
at midafternoon, down from 656.95 million shares as of the same
time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.12 at 512.89.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Imposes Maluku Travel Ban  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TERNATE, Indonesia (AP) -- Fresh street battles between
Christians and Muslims on Friday left at least 18 people dead, and
Indonesia's president blamed paid provocateurs for whipping up
religious hatred in the riot-torn Maluku Islands.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid announced a ban on travel to Maluku
after Islamic vigilantes from other parts of Indonesia joined in
this week's sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Maluku's capital, Ambon, mobs exchanged gunfire and fought
with swords and spears. Others set fire to a Christian university,
two mosques and dozens of homes. Blasts from homemade bombs echoed
through neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Police feared further bloodshed over the weekend, having
reported that rioters broke into a police armory and stole weapons
and uniforms two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Selang, an official at the main Al-Fatah mosque, said 10
Muslims were Friday in the nearby Talake neighborhood. An official
at the state-run Haulusy hospital said at least eight Christians
were killed and about 180 of both faiths were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   At least 31 people have died in Ambon in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Muslim fighters killed more than 100 Christians in
Duma on Halmahera Island. Thousands of Islamic vigilantes from a
group known as the Laksar Jihad, or Holy War Front, took part in
that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 3,000 people have been killed in Maluku's fighting since
the conflict started in January 1999. An influx of Muslim migrants
taking over retail and transport businesses from Christians has
fueled animosities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will imposed strict measures in Maluku to
prohibit people from outside the region from entering,'' Wahid said
in a speech at a Jakarta mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The president is a Muslim scholar who has long espoused
religious tolerance and democratic reform, but who so far has
failed to secure peace in the Malukus.
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate on when travel could be restricted to the
large and remote archipelago. Instead, he condemned outside
interference in the conflict, accusing wealthy and prominent
individuals of funding provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have money, and they provoke people to get involved in
clashes and kill,'' he said, but did not identify the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the upsurge in Maluku's troubles was
orchestrated to destabilize Wahid's government, and they blamed
supporters of former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto was forced from office by protests and riots two years
ago, ending his more than three decades of authoritarian rule.
Suharto -- who like many here uses only one name -- is under house
arrest in a corruption investigation. His lawyers have rejected
suggestions that he is linked to Maluku's violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Ambon, frightened residents said violence was continuing in
the western and eastern outskirts of the city, about 1,500 miles
northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Residents accused some security forces of siding with Muslim
fighters on Friday. Military commanders in Ambon could not be
reached for comment. Both Muslim and Christian leaders in the past
have accused soldiers of taking sides.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, about 200 Islamic protesters threw rocks at offices
occupied by Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission on Friday,
complaining that it had failed to investigate violations against
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the protesting group, calling itself the Islamic
Defenders' Front, accused the state-appointed commission of bias
and said it should be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Several windows were smashed, but there were no reports of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The group, many of its members wearing white Islamic uniforms,
later attacked a restaurant, smashing its windows with wooden
poles.

<HEADLINE> Europe Outraged Over U.S. Execution  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Europeans, who have mounted furious anti-death
penalty campaigns, reacted with outrage but little surprise Friday
to news that the state of Texas had executed death row inmate Gary
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the death penalty is unanimous among European
governments, and the issue is increasingly one on which Europe has
asserted its independence from America. Because Europeans feel they
share so many values with the United States, they are even more
perplexed that it won't abandon capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not fit: The United States presents itself on the one
hand as the world police defending human rights, and on the other
side it carries out the death penalty,'' said German lawmaker
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.
</P>
<P>
   She called on the German government to ''make this detestable
topic the object of discussions with our American friends.''
</P>
<P>
   European anti-death penalty activists are pinning hopes for
change in America on the presidential campaign that has made
capital punishment a national debate. In the wake of the Graham
case, presumptive GOP nominee and Texas Gov. George W. Bush was
taking the brunt of their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Communist newspaper Il Manifesto took a direct swipe at
Bush, featuring a photo covering a third of the front-page under
the headline: ''The executioner doesn't let up.'' The head of
Italy's Democratic Left party, Walter Veltroni, called Bush ''cold
and bureaucratic'' after the governor commented that ''justice was
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The outrage was amplified by a study published last week by
Columbia University that found two-thirds of all death penalty
appeals from 1973-95 were successful. The study's authors said that
fact indicates serious flaws in the capital punishment system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an important step that this knowledge can't be set aside
anymore -- not even in Republican circles,'' said Sina Vogt, a
spokeswoman in Germany for the European Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty. ''We think it is absolutely necessary that Bush
joins his colleague in Illinois in a moratorium on the death
penalty while the system is reviewed. That is the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   While the opposition to Graham's execution was widely expressed
on general principle, critics in Italy, Germany, Britain and at the
United Nations said it also violated international law because
Graham was 17, a minor, at the time of the crime for which he was
sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was found guilty of the 1981 murder of a man during a
holdup outside a Houston supermarket. The state parole board and
appeals courts rejected his arguments that he was convicted on
shaky evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer
did a poor job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a textbook example of how flawed the U.S. approach to
the death penalty is,'' Amnesty International spokesman Rob Freer
said in London. ''The U.S. also flouted requirements of
international law that an accused person should have adequate legal
assistance throughout the process and that the penalty should not
be imposed if there is a serious doubt about the person's guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who had
appealed directly to Bush for a stay of execution, said the
execution ''ran counter to widely accepted international
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she ''acknowledged the seriousness of Mr. Graham's
crime,'' but contended that ''abolition of the death penalty
contributes to enhancement of human dignity and progressive
development of human rights.''

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Billionaire Paul Allen welcomed Steven Spielberg,
Sheryl Crow and dozens of other celebrities -- not to mention old
pal Bill Gates -- at a Thursday gala marking the eve of the grand
opening for his Experience Music Project museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very breathtaking and very fun,'' rock singer Crow said
as she entered the multihued, swoop-sided music museum, which some
say resembles a heap of smashed electric guitars.

partner Jeffery Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, best known for founding Microsoft with Gates, was
inspired to create the rock 'n' roll museum by his passion for
Seattle rock guitar legend Jimi Hendrix.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Lawsuit Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge Friday dismissed anti-abortion
protesters' challenge to a new limit on the size of signs
demonstrators can display outside the Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   The size limit does not violate the Christian Defense
Coalition's free-speech rights, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters ''may still pray, chant, sing, picket, carry
signs of any size, distribute leaflets, make speeches and erect ...
signs of up to four feet by four feet,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The rule ''allows all types of speech regardless of content and
only limits ... signs as necessary to serve the public's safety,
security, access and aesthetic interests,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Patrick Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition,
which challenged the rule, said, ''It's really an outrage. Federal
courts are dictating to American citizens how they are to
peacefully protest. ... They want to maintain decorum at the
expense of free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he planned to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, written by Supreme Court Marshal Dale Bosley and
signed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, was enacted on April
25, the day the justices heard arguments over Nebraska's ban on a
surgical procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That day, 22 Christian Defense Coalition members were arrested
outside the Supreme Court building when they refused to remove
huge, graphic banners that included a full-color depiction of a
decapitated fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of violating the new rule later were dropped, but
the anti-abortion protesters asked Hogan to bar its enforcement in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The rule was issued under a federal law that lets the court
protect its building and grounds and the people who use them. The
rule bans signs larger than 4 feet by 4 feet and elevated more than
6 feet from the ground, unless they are hand-carried.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had propped up some of their signs, including one
that was 4 feet by 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan wrote that while he recognized the interest in protecting
safety, access and aesthetics on the court grounds, he was
''initially concerned that these stated interests were not the real
reasons'' for enacting the rule.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judge said that after hearing Bosley's testimony at
a hearing, he was satisfied that the rule was not based on the
protesters' message.
</P>
<P>
   Bosley testified that he saw only the back of the signs and was
not concerned with their anti-abortion message. He said the signs
were large enough to be used as a weapon, to hide an assailant, to
block the line of sight for court police and to block access to the
court.

<HEADLINE> Civilian Skills Help Guard Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY KURT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP GRUBER, Okla. (AP) -- The air, hot and sticky, clung to Sgt.
Michael Turley's face, and the mob that had surrounded his humvee
was growing unruly.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Oklahoma National Guard put him through this
tense training session, Turley found he already had many skills for
quelling hot tempers and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the peace in Bosnia, he figures, will be a lot like
keeping his cool in his day-to-day job as a manager in a Tulsa
finance company.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about staying calm and not getting stressed out,'' he
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 170 Oklahoma soldiers in the 45th Infantry Brigade who face
deployment to Bosnia in September likely will find their civilian
skills invaluable to their peacekeeping mission, say Guard members
who have gone before them.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Patterson led 147 light infantry soldiers from
Virginia there in 1997 and recalls the ''ranger grunt'' whose
skills as a NASA computer systems engineer helped keep the group's
computers running.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the machine gunner who filled in as an X-ray
technician in the camp clinic. And the soldier who used his civil
engineering skills to create blueprints for fighting positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''And most of these guys are older,'' Patterson said. ''In a
peacekeeping mission, I think they have a better grasp of the
families we're dealing with in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 7,000 Guard members have served in Bosnia since the first
mobilization in 1995. They represent about 21 percent of the U.S.
contingent assigned to keep peace in a region long ruled by
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Texas National Guard's 49th Armored Division took
command of the U.S. peacekeeping operations there.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the Oklahoma soldiers marks the first time
since the Korean War that members of the 45th Infantry Brigade have
been mobilized by federal order.
</P>
<P>
   Their two weeks of training in the muggy heat at Camp Gruber, in
the green hills about 60 miles south of Tulsa, will be followed by
more drills at Fort Stewart, Ga., and Fort Polk, La.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the part-time soldiers found themselves learning a
mindset far different from that of a combat soldier and in some
ways tied to that of their daily dealings as school teachers,
welders and prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   They will encounter civilians on their battlefield. They're
learning not to return sniper fire. Their goal is to diffuse
tempers before they lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected mob testing them in a worst-case scenario
Thursday shouted and banged their fists against the humvees.
Gunners with nervous eyes barked orders to get back. But still they
came.
</P>
<P>
   And then, a pesky television crew jumped in the middle of it.
Started filming. Started shouting questions. The gunners tried to
ignore them. Suddenly, a man stumbled through the crowd with what
looked like a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stop!'' the gunners screamed. When he didn't, their M-16s
snapped into place.
</P>
<P>
   At another site, a cluster of buildings and overturned cars
simulated a Bosnian village.
</P>
<P>
   Four military vehicles roared into town to deal with angry
civilians threatening to hang two foreign doctors who had failed to
heal a baby. Finally, after quick negotiations with the town's
''mayor'' and ''police chief,'' the soldiers were able to escort
the doctors to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's different,'' said Spec. Jacob Dean, a student studying to
become a dentist. ''We need to get there and establish rapport so
they trust us. They haven't been able to trust anyone with
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson saw the peacekeeping training pay off during a 1997
confrontation when Serbs threw rocks at buses of Croatians visiting
a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were donning our riot control gear,'' he said. ''Their
presence de-escalated the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Turley believes the peacekeeping mission will bring more
complications than combat. It carries the dangers of buried mines
and possible sniper attacks and the goal of maintaining calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really isn't an enemy,'' he said, ''unless somebody
starts posing a threat.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Party's Power Shift Under Way  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- It was the strangest of farewells.
</P>
<P>
   The frail voice of ailing kingmaker Noboru Takeshita crackled
from a tape recorder at the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
headquarters last month, announcing his retirement. The somber
faces of party cadres were a measure of the loyalty the former
premier commanded.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene was also symbolic of something else: a shift in
the top ranks of Japan's dominant political force.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of being managed behind the scenes, the Liberal
Democratic Party now has no obvious candidates to take over as
party puppet-master -- a development that some say could lead the
party to a more open, democratic way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita died this past week. Another elderly LDP power broker,
Seiroku Kajiyama, and former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who led
the party's dominant faction and left no heir apparent, also died
recently. Thirteen other lower house LDP lawmakers are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no longer any superpower in the LDP,'' said Shigenori
Okazaki, a political analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. ''We're
probably seeing the beginning of the end of the good old days of
LDP politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is apparently not having much of an effect on the
party as it heads into Sunday's lower house elections. Despite a
weak economy and an unpopular prime minister, polls show the LDP
has an excellent chance of keeping its grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative LDP, which has ruled Japan almost uninterrupted
since 1955, has thrived largely because of powerful ''shadow
shoguns'' capable of browbeating fractious rival groupings into
consensus. Several figures are jockeying for control, among them
three-time LDP secretary general Koichi Kato, 60, and Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono, 63. But none is likely to develop the clout of
Takeshita, and a power vacuum is forming.
</P>
<P>
   While the LDP has reason to be concerned, the departure of
powerful old guard politicians has raised hope for more
transparency in a party accused of disdaining accountability in its
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''The age of the kingmaker is coming to end,'' said Takashi
Inoguchi, a politics professor at Tokyo University. ''We're
entering a period of confused fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's faction, of which Takeshita was the uncontested
behind-the-scenes leader, has for years been the biggest, richest
and most powerful in the LDP. It has been the main engine of
profligate spending policies that have propped up the economy but
threatened to bankrupt the country. The faction's influence is
likely to wane without its erstwhile leaders, and that could open
the field for fresh blood in the party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But not all signs point to a break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hiromitsu Nishiwaki, an official of the LDP's political reform
committee, said it's time to ''hand things over to a new
generation.'' But, he added, ''a change in the system in place up
to now can't happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the unpopularity of Obuchi's replacement, Yoshiro
Mori, success in Sunday's election could lessen any pressure on the
LDP to change its ways. The fractured opposition presents little
challenge to the LDP, which rules in a coalition with two smaller
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as signs emerge that the country is back on the track
of economic expansion, there are concerns that the Liberal
Democrats will abandon painful structural reform and remain as
enamored as ever of their pork-barrel ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any big change in LDP politics,'' said 53-year-old
Tokyo company worker Yasukuni Fujii. ''The young lawmakers who are
criticizing the leadership would tone down their rhetoric if they
came into power.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 84; Dow Up 28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip shares
rising and technology stocks coming under selling pressure for the
second straight day as investors locked in profits following a
weeks-long runup.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 28.28 at 10,404.40.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 12.23 at 1,439.95,
while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was down 83.53 at
3,853.31.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit of the technology stocks was Amazon.com,
which plunged $9.125 to $32.875 after Lehman Brothers fixed-income
analyst Ravi Suria released a research note describing ''extremely
weak and deteriorating'' credit at the online retailing giant.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks falling Friday included Yahoo!, off
$8.50 at $123.375.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in the technology sector were somewhat offset by
gains in the semiconductor shares. Rambus' stock rose $17.875 to
$115 after the memory chip maker said that it ended its patent
infringement lawsuit against Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a
worldwide licensing agreement on a variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signs that the economy has been slowing in response
to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the past year, traders are
hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed may still move
to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market hates uncertainty and we have a big uncertainty in
front of us,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''When people are
confused on Wall Street, they often keep their hands in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also worry that the slowing U.S. economy will eat away
at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those fears were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, were up $3.063 Friday at $89.938.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.125 to $20.50 after it
announced it was being bought for $1.6 billion in cash and stock by
ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy Choice, Butterball, Orville
Redenbacher, and Swiss Miss brands. International Home Foods owns
Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and Gulden's Mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.
Manville's shares were up 87.5 cents to $13.188.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 674.56 million shares
at late afternoon, down from 785.11 million shares as of the same
time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 4.97 at 510.04.

<HEADLINE> AHA May Back Stem Cell Research  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The American Heart Association is considering
endorsing and even paying for research of embryonic stem cells, the
building blocks of all human tissue typically derived from aborted
fetuses or human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The research could bring breakthroughs for people suffering from
ailments including heart diseases and strokes, medical experts
said. But moral and ethical questions persist from opponents who
say using the stem cells is exploitative, given their sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're creating a whole new market for these babies,'' said
Kyleen Wright, president for the Texans for Life Coalition, which
opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-member task force, appointed by the Dallas-based
nonprofit association early last year, plans to make a
recommendation to the association's board on Sunday. David
Livingston, the association's corporate secretary, would not
disclose the task force's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The stem cell panel includes scientists, a bioethicist and
association advocates familiar with the issue, Livingston said.
Since last fall, panelists have interviewed scientific councils and
research organizations, Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Board approval would let the heart association use donor dollars
to finance research through various organizations, Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rose Marie Robertson, the association's president-elect,
said she cannot predict the board's vote, though members seriously
consider task force recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people who are absolutely dedicated to preventing
death or disability'' from heart diseases, said Robertson, a
professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are the body's master cells, programmed to produce
different body parts. Scientists have long culled different kinds
of stem cells circulating in the adult body, and ongoing
experiments are aimed at manipulating those cells to regenerate
bone, muscle and even brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pluripotent stem cells,'' the earliest-stage type, are the
only ones that can grow into any tissue in the body. They only come
from embryos, from either very early-stage abortions or donations
by women who have embryos left over after fertility treatments.
(Some private companies are growing ''cell lines,'' multiplying an
initial batch of stem cells for future research.)
</P>
<P>
   The association is interested in the research because stem cells
could eventually be cultivated to become cardiac tissue, then
transplanted into failing or weakened hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and other experts say the decision to have an
abortion or discard an embryo is made independently and before any
research or transplants would take place.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it is a very difficult issue,'' Livingston said. ''There
are a lot of ethical and moral views to consider.''

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Names Multiethnic Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Bosnia's legislature has
approved a new multiethnic government, six months after the
previous government was declared illegal, a government official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cabinet, whose members were proposed by recently
appointed Prime Minister Spasoje Tusevljak, won approval from
parliament on Thursday, said Branka Todorovic, secretary-general of
the Bosnian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The previous body was declared illegal because it had two prime
ministers. It was dissolved in February, and it took Bosnia's
three-member collective presidency six months to come up with a new
candidate to form the government.
</P>
<P>
   Tusevljak, an obscure Serb economics professor, was approved by
parliament earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Each minister in Tusevljak's new government has two deputies
from each of the other ethnic groups. For example, if a minister is
a Bosnian Serb, he will have a Bosnian Muslim and a Croat deputy.
The concept ensures that all three ethnic groups have equal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This government represents a compromise which respects the
reality of the political moment in Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Tusevljak
said after his government won approval Thursday evening.
''Bosnia-Herzegovina is a complex country and it is not easy to
work in its joint institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tusevljak's nomination surprised international officials, who
effectively run the country, as well as the Bosnian public.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a publicly unknown figure, some have expressed
doubted about whether he will be able to steer the country toward
the required democratic and economic reforms: Privatization of
state-owned assets, the return of more than 1 million refugees to
their prewar homes and formation of a common market between the two
autonomous regions -- the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
   International officials said they will keep a close eye on the
new prime minister. They hinted that if they become unsatisfied
with his work, he might be removed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Adopts Information Doctrine  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Amid growing concerns about media freedom in
Russia, President Vladimir Putin's powerful Security Council
approved an ''information security doctrine'' Friday to strengthen
the government's role in monitoring information flow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the doctrine would safeguard journalists' rights,
help crack down on computer crime and support the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The document wasn't immediately published, and without details,
its impact on media freedom was unclear. But critics were skeptical
about the document's true aims.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of earlier drafts said the government is using new
phrases to describe a Soviet-style propaganda machine where speech
flows freely from the government to the people, but not the other
way around.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a Soviet manner, it equates the protection of public
interest with the protection of state interests,'' radio talk show
host Alexei Venediktov was quoted as saying in the Moscow Times
newspaper about an earlier draft.
</P>
<P>
   Media freedom advocates have expressed concern about the
doctrine since it came under discussion in 1997, but declined to
comment on the document because it hadn't been published.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is a secretive advisory body formed under
Boris Yeltsin to coordinate the activities of the armed forces,
security agencies and police. Among others, it includes the defense
minister and the head of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   The council's decisions are not legally binding, but have often
been used as a basis for presidential decrees, which do not need
legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the council on Friday, Putin dismissed criticism
that his government is cracking down on freedom of the press,
saying ''without a free mass media there is no free society.'' He
said the nonbinding doctrine approved Friday is aimed at boosting
the government's ability to inform the public about policies such
as tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine also outlines steps to fight hacking and other
computer crimes, which have caused serious damage in Russia, and
help local companies provide information services to the country's
far-flung regions, he said. Putin was apparently referring to
Internet access, which is extremely limited outside Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   He could also mean more government oversight of the Internet. It
is already mandatory for Russian companies operating Web servers to
forward copies of electronic traffic to the Federal Security
Service, the successor agency of the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ivanov, chairman of the Security Council, said the
doctrine may also call for creating a new state ministry or agency
for information, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state has lost the capability of informing society,''
Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying. The government should ''create
the appropriate state mechanism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government already has a Press and Information
Ministry. It also controls two of three national television
networks, a newspaper and two news agencies where official views
are routinely reported at length.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision by the Security Council coincided with a
police interrogation of Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of Russia's
largest independent television station.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators questioned Gusinsky on 2-year-old fraud charges
that led to his arrest last week. They also rebuked him for going
public with details about the charges, saying he could face more
counts as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was held for three days, triggering international
protests, and released on condition he not leave Moscow. His
lawyer, Genri Reznik, dismissed the accusations against him, saying
investigators have yet to say exactly what property Gusinsky is
accused of misappropriating in the fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is absurd, and I'm not planning in taking part in this
absurdity,'' Gusinsky said after leaving the prosecutor's office,
according to the Interfax news agency.

<HEADLINE> French Air Controllers To Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French civil aviation authorities on Friday advised
passengers not to fly to or from France on Monday, when a planned
strike by air traffic controllers would cause most flights in the
country to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The General Direction for Civil Aviation predicted 80 percent of
flights in and out of France would be shut down Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Union of Air Traffic Controllers and air traffic
controllers from other French unions called the one-day strike to
protest what they claimed were plans by the European Union to
privatize their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated case, unions representing employees of Air
Littoral, Air Liberte, Sabena France and Swissair France planned a
strike June 30-July 1 to protest their companies' sale to
Swissair's SAir Group. They said they faced job losses, moves and
lower benefits under the new ownership.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Gov't Drafts Terrorist Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Heralding even tougher times for
political opponents, President Slobodan Milosevic's Cabinet on
Friday submitted to parliament a draft anti-terrorism law aimed at
curbing dissent.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement distributed by the official Tanjug news
agency said the anti-terrorism law was drafted according to similar
laws in England, Spain or Italy. It said the Cabinet asked for the
measure's ''urgent'' adoption at the next parliament session,
scheduled for June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the government said the draft law provides for
broader police authority, changes in criminal court procedure,
increased border control and ''certain limitations in the work of
the lawyers.'' Independent analysts fear the proposed laws will
pave the way for a new, major sweep against Serbia's fledgling
opposition parties and nongovernment organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The repression will become systematic from now on,'' said
Goran Svilanovic, the leader of opposition Civic Alliance. ''With
this law they are preparing terrain for future possible widespread
unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, an official of the opposition Serbian Renewal
Movement, said the proposed law is a political one aimed at
pressuring the opposition. He said it would bring the regime one
step closer to ''real dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused regime opponents of anti-state
activities and ''terrorism.'' It says the opposition works under
instructions from the United States and NATO, which the government
says want to destroy Yugoslavia and install a pro-Western
government.
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations increased after a series of murders of
high-ranking officials earlier this year, including Defense
Minister Pavle Bulatovic in February and Socialist official Bosko
Perosevic in May.
</P>
<P>
   The government blamed the killings on the pro-democracy
movement. Stepping up pressure against independent media and
dissent since then, Milosevic's regime has closed down several
television and radio stations and detained hundreds of opposition
activists.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest crackdown, more than 30 activists of the popular
student-run Otpor, or Resistance, group were detained Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law will not stop our struggle,'' said Vukasin Petrovic, a
student leader in Otpor. ''We will continue even harder. It can't
harm us. They cannot arrest nine million people, the whole of
Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   When passed by the federal parliament, the anti-terrorism law
will also formally apply to Montenegro, Serbia's partner in
Yugoslavia. Montenegro's pro-Western leadership is at odds with
Milosevic's federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin justice minister, Dragan Soc, dismissed the
draft law as ''just another way to pressure'' officials in
Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, the private Beta news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we do not recognize the legitimacy of the federal
parliament, such a law will not be applicable in Montenegro,'' Soc
said.

<HEADLINE> US May Make Chinese Leave Building  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States could force the Chinese news
agency Xinhua to give up a new building bought near the Pentagon
because the agency didn't get the needed approval, the State
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said the department ''can
require divestiture'' of the seven-story building under the law
that governs foreign missions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at the options,'' talking to the Chinese Embassy
and consulting with the Justice Department about how to handle the
issue, Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker says the Chinese Embassy was notified in May, 1985, the
government-affiliated Xinhua would come under the Foreign Missions
Act, which says among other things that missions must get prior
approval to sell or buy real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The department has no record the embassy sent such notification
on the purchase of the building less than a mile from the Pentagon
and learned of it this week through press reports, Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy spokesman was not immediately for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has said it wants the building for a new news room
and living quarters. Reeker said Xinhua got its current property in
Virginia in January of 1985 and twice previously asked for and
received permission to buy properties. Those were in New York in
1991 and Los Angeles in 1998, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bill adds criminal checks for new school employees  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Assembly Friday gave final
legislative approval to a measure that would require school
districts to fingerprint all prospective employees, including
teachers, for criminal history screening.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, school employees would be required to report
allegations of child abuse on school grounds to law enforcement
authorities. Failure to do so would be a Class A misdemeanor,
punishable by up to a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   State Legislature leaders reached agreement on the measure
Thursday and the Senate passed it later that day. The bill now goes
to Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, the Division of Criminal Justice Services
(DCJS) and the FBI would conduct the background checks and send the
results back to the state Education Department, which would then
decide whether an applicant is cleared for employment.
</P>
<P>
   A processing fee of $74 will be assessed for each procedure,
with $24 going to the FBI and $50 to DCJS. Applicants would be
responsible for paying the fee, but school districts would have the
authority to waive payment if an individual could prove financial
hardship. The bill would take effect July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in New York City has required fingerprinting for the
past 20 years and ''this is just catch-up for the rest of the
state,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation
of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Added Alan Lubin of the New York State United Teachers: ''While
fingerprinting is no magic bullet or substitute for the careful
screening of applicants, it's a useful tool that provides an
additional measure of protection for students.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Kremer, executive director of the New York State School
Boards Association, said a centralized program would prevent those
with a criminal history to ''go from school district to school
district to find a safe place'' where they can be employed without
any screening.
</P>
<P>
   He added that penalizing those who fail to report allegations of
child abuse would help end the practice of ''silent resignation'' -
instances where such allegations are not reported to law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Assembly gave final legislative approval to a
package of bills designed to cut school violence. Among its
features are provisions giving teachers more latitude in banishing
unruly students from their classrooms, making student-on-teacher
and teacher-on-student assaults felonies and requiring all
districts to have school safety plans and incorporate civility
education in their curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten called the legislation a ''watershed achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People have finally understood and recognized in New York
state that that codes of conduct are important in schools,'' she
said. ''This is an opportunity to teach kids and create
interventions so kids don't fall through the cracks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, who chaired the Governor's Task Force on
School Violence, applauded the passage of the legislation. The bill
''establishes a new, comprehensive school safety policy of
planning, prevention and deterrence aimed at enhancing school
safety in every community in the state,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also calls for students in grades kindergarten
through 12 to receive instruction on citizenship and character.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Condemn High Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High gas prices have become a hot topic this
election-year summer. On the presidential campaign trail, around
Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the country, politicians are
railing against the record prices that average $1.65 a gallon
nationwide and top $2 in parts of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing everybody agrees on is that somebody else
is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are looking to Congress for leadership and constructive
action,'' House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at a
news conference Friday. ''Instead, the Republicans in Congress have
served up inaction and a fast and furious blame game.''
</P>
<P>
   At another news conference 90 minutes later, House Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma offered a different
view.
</P>
<P>
   ''It becomes blatantly obvious that Democrats would rather do
what is politically convenient rather than provide relief to the
American people,'' he said. ''It's time for Democrats to join us
and help provide relief at the pump for millions of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan
Rothenberg Political Report, said disagreement about what is
causing the high prices makes it easier to blame somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is latching onto this because when you are talking
about a pocketbook issue like this, it has political
ramifications,'' he said. ''Every politician in Congress and
running for president wants to at least get some face time
expressing concern about the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states aren't waiting for help from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon has suspended the state sales tax on
gasoline for 60 days. And the Illinois Legislature will meet in
special session next week to discuss repealing or suspending the
state's 5 percent sales tax on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of ideas floating around Capitol Hill --
suspending the federal gas tax, releasing oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve and passing legislation to let Americans sue the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- but none has gained
significant backing.
</P>
<P>
   So the finger-pointing continues.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush and other Republicans
blame the Clinton administration, saying it hasn't done enough to
get OPEC to boost production and faulting the Environmental
Protection Agency for requiring certain smoggy areas to use gas
that is cleaner-burning but more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats blame the big oil
companies, saying they are maximizing profits at the expense of
consumers. The Federal Trade Commission this week opened a formal
investigation into possible price gouging and collusion among the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies say they have done nothing wrong and predict
market forces eventually will drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
   The different theories -- as well as the public interest in the
issue -- keep the rhetoric going.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter your party or your ideology, politicians
want to be on record notifying the problem, identifying with
consumers and pushing for a solution,'' Rothenberg said. ''A
politician who is silent on this is vulnerable.''

<HEADLINE> Bills approved by lawmakers in their end-of-session push  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Highlights of legislation approved by the state
Assembly and
Senate during their push to conclude the regular 2000 session of
the Legislature:
<TEXT>
<P>
   - The Legislature passed a bill that would require school
districts to fingerprint prospective employees, including teachers,
for criminal history checks. The Division of Criminal Justice
Services and the FBI will conduct the background checks and return
the results to the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   - All day care workers would undergo criminal background checks
and be required to undergo more training under a bill approved by
the Senate and Assembly. It also contains $40 million to encourage
more people to go into day care and to keep current workers in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   - The Legislature passed a package of bills designed to cut
school violence. Among its features are provisions giving teachers
more latitude in banishing unruly students from their classrooms,
making student-on-teacher and teacher-on-student assaults felonies
and requiring all districts to have school disaster contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
   - Each chamber approved a bill to increase penalties for crimes
committed on the basis of a victim's age, gender, religion, race,
sexual orientation and other personal characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   - Each chamber approved a package toughening penalties for a
range of sex-related crimes, from ''date rapes'' to repeated child
molestations.
</P>
<P>
   - The Assembly and Senate passed a gun control package which
mandates that guns be equipped with trigger locks and that
authorities be provided with new gun ballistic ''fingerprints'' so
the weapons can be traced to crimes based on spent bullet casings.
</P>
<P>
   - Both chambers approved and sent Gov. George Pataki a bill
allowing counties to require that nearby neighbors be given 48
hours' notice when pesticides are being used by commercial
applicators. Parents would also have to be notified when pesticides
are being used at their children's' schools.
</P>
<P>
   - Both chambers passed measures restricting emissions from
personal watercrafts known by many as ''Jet Skis'' and also
authorized cities, towns and villages to restrict or ban ''Jet
Skis'' from local waterways.
</P>
<P>
   - The Assembly and Senate approved a measure raising a cap
imposed 15 years ago on the fees lawyers can collect in medical
malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   - Both chambers passed a measure providing for physician
''profiles'' to be made available to health consumers in New York.
Some information about doctors' medical malpractice settlements
would be available in the profiles.
</P>
<P>
   - Lawmakers sent Pataki a bill introducing the regulation of
bounty hunters in New York state by requiring them to complete a
25-hour training course if they are going to operate in New York
and to notify law enforcement agents when they are seeking a
fugitive locally.
</P>
<P>
   The measure stemmed from the 1998 death of Buffalo Police
Officer Robert McLellan as he was chasing a fugitive also being
sought by four Maryland bounty hunters. McLellan was hit and killed
by a car.
</P>
<P>
   - The Legislature agreed on a bill to waive the prosecution of
women and men who abandon their newborn babies - if they leave them
unharmed at hospitals or other ''appropriate'' settings. The waiver
would apply to babies less than six days old. The measure would
also direct the Pataki administration to conduct a public
information campaign about the new law.
</P>
<P>
   - Lawmakers sent Pataki a bill calling for children under age 16
to wear seat belts when traveling in the rear of a car. Currently,
children between the ages of 5 and 10 have to be buckled into the
back seat of a car, but after 10 they do not have to wear seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters under 5 must be buckled into approved safety seats.
Drivers and front-seat passengers of all ages must wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   - The Legislature passed a bill requiring some delivery trucks
to be equipped with an electronic monitoring device or one or more
cross-view backup mirrors. Those mirrors are designed to let
drivers see directly behind the bulky vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is named the ''Joseph Robert Henderson Memorial
Act'' in honor of a 5-year-old boy killed when he was struck by a
parcel deliver vehicle truck backing up in the driveway of the
boy's Ulster County home.
</P>
<P>
   - The Legislature passed a bill making state agencies put a
priority on buying remanufactured commodities through the state's
procurement process.
</P>
<P>
   - The Senate approved an agreed-to bill to crack down on money
laundering. Pataki said the deal calls for the elimination of
provisions in the current law which criminals are using as
loopholes. They include a prosecutor having to prove that a person
actually ''exchanged'' the proceeds of a criminal transaction to
received ''equivalent property'' in return in order to bring
money-laundering charges against that person.

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects ACLU bid to bar Wall Township's holiday display  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge says Wall Township can again
erect its December holiday display, but urged the Monmouth County
municipality to make some changes to put the display in ''safer
constitutional waters.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin on Friday dismissed a
lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union contending that the
display was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by
government.
</P>
<P>
   Wolin said the case was a close call but that he was able to
decide it without a trial, basing his decision on pictures of the
display and written briefs.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that future litigation could be avoided if
the township added an additional ''secular sculptural element'' and
changed a sign to ''Seasons Greetings'' instead of ''Merry
Christmas Happy Hanukkah.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is the latest clash in New Jersey over the First
Amendment mandate for separation of church and state, an issue that
the ACLU believes has brought conflicting opinions from federal
appellate courts in a five-year legal dispute over Jersey City's
winter holiday display.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City and Wall both use public funds to maintain and erect
the displays in front of their respective city halls. Both towns
use that space for a variety of displays throughout the year, in
honor of religious and secular holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU said the Wall display was ''substantially similar'' to
a Jersey City display that was found to be not secular enough, but
Wall disagreed and got legal help from The Becket Fund for
Religious Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Becket Fund is a public interest law firm in Washington that
represented Jersey City in its successful fight to retain its
holiday display in front of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Committeeman Michael D. Fitzgerald, who was mayor last
year, said the Township Committee would consider the judge's
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an appropriate display that celebrates heritage and other
holidays, not just Christmas, as the ACLU wanted to couch it,''
said Fitzgerald, whose sprawling township of 24,000 comprises
suburban housing and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU had no immediate comment, said legal director Lenora M.
Lapidus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a creche, with figures depicting the birth of
Jesus in the manger, and menorah, a symbol of the Jewish holiday of
Hanukkah, the Wall display last year featured four banners with
candy canes, a lighted Christmas tree, two large poinsettias, and a
sign stating that ''through this and other displays and events
through the year, Wall Township is pleased to celebrate our
American cultural traditions, as well as our legacy of diversity of
freedom,'' The Becket Fund said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU claimed, among other things, that at night ''only the
tree, the menorah and the creche are lighted,'' eliminating secular
symbols such as banners and planting.
</P>
<P>
   Wolin disagreed, saying the banners are at least partly
illuminated at night and that the planned addition of a sleigh and
reindeer will also be lighted.
</P>
<P>
   Although he dismissed the ACLU lawsuit, Wolin said the
organization could ask him to revisit the issue if Wall departs
from prior displays in such a way that endorses religion.

<HEADLINE> Yugo Army Maneuvers in Montenegro  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's army showed its muscle
to the pro-independence Montenegrin leadership Friday, staging a
massive military exercise in Montenegro along the country's
volatile border with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Army's exercise -- code-named Operation Granite 2000 --
involved land forces, rapid reaction troops and air power. It was
the first operation of its kind since last year's 78-day NATO
bombing, which forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
accept a peace deal for the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Army is responsible for Montenegro, Serbia's smaller
partner in the Yugoslav federation. The small mountainous republic
of 600,000 people remained in Yugoslavia even after other republics
pulled out, but recently its leadership has been focusing on
forging ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's military exercise, planned last year, was postponed
because of local elections two weeks ago in two major Montenegro
towns -- Herceg Novi and the capital, Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the exercise was to practice ''how to counter an
assault of an enemy's airborne units and terrorist groups,'' said
2nd Army spokesman Col. Stanimir Dasic. He did say how many troops
and aircraft were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Military attaches from Austria, Greece, Italy, Hungary and a
number of other countries were able to observe the maneuvers.

<HEADLINE> South African Oil Tanker Sinks  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A tanker carrying 1,300 tons of
oil sank Friday six miles off Cape Town, unleashing a large slick
that was threatening Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was
imprisoned 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ship had developed a 56-foot-wide hole in the hull, but its
cause was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   All 29 crew members, most of them Chinese, were airlifted to
safety as the Panamanian-registered Treasure -- en route from China
to Brazil -- went down before dawn while authorities were trying to
tow it farther offshore to reduce the risk of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The oil did not pose an immediate threat to the popular beaches
along the coast, said Jerry Lengoasa of the Environmental Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-square-mile slick was a danger to Robben Island, a
rocky outcrop where political prisoners were incarcerated by the
apartheid government. Mandela, now the former president, spent 17
of his 27 years in prison there.
</P>
<P>
   The island is now a museum and World Heritage Site and home to a
large colony of penguins and other birds.
</P>

   The South African Maritime Safety Authority said air patrols
were trying to determine the direction the slick was moving, while

oil,'' Lengoasa said.

<P>
   South Africa's last major oil spill was in 1994 when the bulk
ore carrier Apollo Sea sank 40 miles north of Cape Town, killing 36
crew members and causing extensive environmental damage. The
Treasure was carrying twice as much oil as the Apollo Sea.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 91; Dow Gains 29  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip shares
rising and technology stocks coming under selling pressure for the
second straight day as investors locked in profits following a
weeks-long runup. Amazon.com plummeted 19 percent after an
influential analyst warned of risks facing the online retailer.
</P>
<P>
   At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
finished up 28.63 at 10,404.75, according to preliminary
calculations. For the week, Wall Street's best-known indicator
slipped 44.55.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.64 at 1,441.54,
while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 91.19
points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,845.65.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit of the technology stocks was Amazon.com,
which plunged $8.344 to $34.656 after Lehman Brothers fixed-income
analyst Ravi Suria released a research note describing ''extremely
weak and deteriorating'' credit.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks falling Friday included Yahoo!, off
$6.41 at $123.281.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in the technology sector were somewhat offset by
gains in the semiconductor shares. Rambus' stock rose $17.50 to
$114.625 after the memory chip maker said that it ended its patent
infringement lawsuit against Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a
worldwide licensing agreement on a variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signs that the economy has been slowing in response
to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the past year, traders are
hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed may still move
to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market hates uncertainty and we have a big uncertainty in
front of us,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''When people are
confused on Wall Street, they often keep their hands in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also worry that the slowing U.S. economy will eat away
at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those fears were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, were up $3.063 Friday at $89.938.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.25 to $20.625 after it
announced it was being bought for $1.6 billion in cash and stock by
ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy Choice, Butterball, Orville
Redenbacher, Hunt's and Swiss Miss brands. International Home Foods
owns Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and Gulden's Mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.
Manville's shares were up 87.5 cents to $13.188.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 844.73 million
shares, down from 1.01 billion shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 4.60 at 510.41.

<HEADLINE> Physician 'profiling' among last items on lawmakers' agenda  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New Yorkers would get access to more
background information about physicians under one of the last bills
approved Friday by the state Assembly at the close of its regular
2000 session.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called physician profiling measure is not as extensive as
health consumer advocates had lobbied for, but most said it would
be better than the sketchy information about doctors now available
to average New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   It breezed through the Assembly Friday in what Speaker Sheldon
Silver said would be the final meeting before his chamber broke for
the summer, and possibly the rest of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills approved by the Democrat-dominated Assembly Friday
included a gun-control package, a measure designed to make schools
safer for both students and staff and a bill increasing penalties
for sex crimes. The same bills were approved by the
Republican-controlled state Senate before it completed its 2000
regular session about 1:45 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly came back for an extra day and ended its
deliberations at 4:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's early morning hours, the Legislature also finished
passing a bill to toughen penalties for hate crimes. They are
offenses committed against people on the basis of victims' race,
sex, sexual orientation, religion, age or other personal
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   The physician profiling bill had appeared to be dead despite
weeks of talks between the Senate and Assembly. In the end, the
Assembly agreed to accept a Senate bill that Assembly Health
Committee Chairman Richard Gottfried, D-Manhattan, said was not as
strong as the one Assembly Democrats favored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say we probably got two-thirds of a loaf,'' Gottfried
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the state Health Department would have to make
available certain information about physicians, including where
they were educated, whether they have been disciplined by the state
or a hospital, the names of other doctors in their practice and the
name of their malpractice insurance provider.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also require that malpractice judgments or
verdicts against doctors be posted and mandate that three or more
malpractice settlements with patients within the past 10 years also
be posted.
</P>
<P>
   Providing information on the malpractice settlements was the
sticking point between the Assembly and Senate over the bill. The
Assembly wanted all such settlements over 10 years listed in the
physician profile.
</P>
<P>
   The state Medical Society opposed that provision, however,
saying doctors who choose to settle nuisance malpractice suits or
those with an isolated settlement would unfairly be made to look
incompetent. The Senate agreed with the Medical Society on that
point.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation does allow the state health commissioner to
order settlements listed if it is determined the information would
be relevant to the care a patient can expect from the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group, an
advocate of the physician profile bill, said his group would lobby
for a strict reading of the profiling statute by the health
commissioner. He said any settlement involving a patient death
should be listed on the profile.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the profiles will be available through
the Web site maintained on the Internet by the state Department of
Health and via an 800 telephone number. Gottfried said he did not
expect the information to be available for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Friday he was unaware of the deal between the
Assembly and Senate on the bill and would look at the measure when
it reached his desk.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Assesses China's Military Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chinese military plans to increase the
number of short-range missiles aimed at Taiwan as it focuses
military preparations on a possible clash with Taiwan involving the
United States, the Pentagon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest U.S. assessment of Beijing's military power and
strategy neither predicts a Chinese attempt to win control of
Taiwan by force -- nor dismisses the possibility. But it says
China's army is buying the kinds of weapons that could be used in a
pre-emptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   These include cruise missiles and ballistic missiles of longer
ranges and greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The warning time for missile launches most likely will
decrease as China expands its missile force opposite Taiwan,'' the
Pentagon report said. It is the latest in a series of assessments
on China required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that despite its increasing preparations
for a potential clash, Beijing is unlikely to attack Taiwan because
the Chinese believe war would jeopardize their economic growth and
world standing.
</P>
<P>
   It says China is strengthening its military on a broad front
but, despite having a far larger armed force, would still face
''significant shortcomings'' in a conflict with Taiwan, even a
decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming five years, the 2.4 million-strong Chinese army
will have ''only a limited capability'' to conduct offensive
operations against Taiwan in a way that effectively combines air,
sea and land forces, the report says. It says the Chinese
military's naval, air and ground troops are not fully integrated
into a cohesive combat force.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term -- in the 2010-to-2020 period -- China could
gain a greater edge over Taiwan in both the quality and quantity of
its military forces, the report said. At that point Taiwan's
success in deterring Chinese aggression will depend on its ability
to acquire and operate modern arms and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon released its report shortly after Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright completed a visit to Beijing where she
urged President Jiang Zemin to take up Taiwan's suggestion for
direct talks on easing tensions.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Taiwan said China began live-fire artillery tests off
its southeast coast. Taiwanese and American officials called the
exercises routine and not a threat to the island.
</P>
<P>
   The communist government in Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade
province and insists it not seek international recognition as a
separate state. China has refused to renounce the option of using
force against Taiwan and has said it might do so in any of three
circumstances: if Taiwan declared independence, if a foreign power
intervened to stop reunification on China's terms or if Taiwan
gained nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy is to view Taiwan as part of China, although the
United States sells defensive arms to the island, which split from
mainland China after the communist takeover in October 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ''A cross-Strait conflict between China and Taiwan involving the
United States has emerged as the dominant scenario guiding (Chinese
army) force planning, military training and war preparation,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that China might resort to nuclear strikes
in the event the United States intervened militarily on behalf of
Taiwan. China is believed to have about 18 nuclear armed missiles
capable of reaching U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a third party were to intervene militarily in a regional
conflict involving China, the (Chinese army) would employ all means
necessary in the hope of inflicting high casualties and weakening
the intervening party's resolve,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   An official familiar with the report's preparation said this
implies the possibility of nuclear attack, although China says its
nuclear arms are intended for retaliation rather than first strike.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the U.S.-led NATO air strikes over Kosovo in
1999 served to reinforce and increase the Chinese military's
''sense of urgency'' in developing the kinds of weaponry, training
and tactics geared toward pre-emptive strikes.

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Stops Action in Mitrovica  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The U.N. refugee agency suspended
operations Friday in the northern part of the divided city of
Kosovska Mitrovica after rioters attacked humanitarian workers.
</P>
<P>
   Past riots in the northern and predominantly Serb part of the
city have targeted U.N. vehicles and injured U.N. workers. Serb
rioters escalated the violence in recent days, attacking an
international aid worker, destroying five U.N. vehicles and
damaging 20 others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past month, the level and frequency of attacks on
humanitarian staff, damage to vehicles, and threats to humanitarian
operations in north Mitrovica has been totally unacceptable,''
Dennis McNamara of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in
a statement. ''We are not prepared to continue to have the safety
of our own staff and our agency partners put in constant
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   The northern Kosovo city is one of the few in the overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian province where many Serbs remain. It has been the
site of constant unrest since the United Nations took over
administration of Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, aid workers closed the UNHCR office in northern
Kosovska Mitrovica and relocated to the southern and predominantly
ethnic Albanian part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how much of an impact the
suspension would have on people in the northern part of the city.
McNamara said that after the two-day suspension, the UNHCR would
examine its options and determine its next move.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the UNHCR insisted that the leader of the
Serbs in the northern part of the city, Oliver Ivanovic, ''publicly
denounce the violence and take more vigorous action to prevent it
from recurring.''

<HEADLINE> State and towns seeking lifeguards in tight job market  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state and many towns are having
trouble keeping their heads above water when it comes to hiring
lifeguards for ponds and pools.
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers who worked as lifeguards in previous years have
taken better-paying jobs elsewhere, as employers offer higher wages
because of the state's shrinking labor pool, state officials say.
The unemployment rate in Connecticut was 2.4 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't drive down the main road without seeing a help
wanted sign,'' said Bill Mattioli, water safety program coordinator
for the state Department of Environmental Protection. ''We have a
lot to compete with.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattioli said the DEP has yet to fill 30 of its 99 lifeguard
positions at parks statewide, and the summer swimming season is
approaching full stride.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors of the 19 state parks with swimming areas are
greeted with signs warning them that there are no lifeguards on
duty, Mattioli said.
</P>
<P>
   At Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison, only 10 of the 18
lifeguard positions are filled for the state's largest swimming
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioli said officials continue to struggle to find new
lifeguards, whom the state pays $7 to $12 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Higher certification costs may be part of the reason why young
people aren't flocking to work in the sun and water.
</P>
<P>
   George Taterosia, Fairfield's waterfront director, said
certification can cost about $360, compared to the $25 or so it
cost years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport officials said their town has been heavily impacted
by the lifeguard shortage. The city had hired only six lifeguards
to fill 25 positions as of this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Bolton, officials were forced to postpone the Memorial Day
opening of Indian Notch Lake because they had trouble finding
lifeguards. The park has been open only limited hours in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford swimming officials, meanwhile, said they are fortunate
to have most of the lifeguard positions filled, thanks to a program
that recruits school students for the jobs. And the average
lifeguard pay in the city is $13.25 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just where we need to be,'' said Penny Leto, an analyst
for Hartford's Human Services Department. ''We don't have any
extras.''
</P>
<P>
   Leto said she was well aware of the statewide shortage. She said
it has affected area youth organizations because they are required
by state law to provide their own lifeguards when going to state
parks.

<HEADLINE> Interim board established to monitor Nassau finances  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Legislation establishing a temporary board
to help bail out financially troubled Nassau County was signed into
law by Gov. George Pataki Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau Interim Finance Authority (NIFA) will oversee the
county's budgeting. If local officials fail to take a fiscally
prudent course, the panel will turn into a formal financial control
board with more direct budgeting powers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is one of two bills approved by the state
Legislature last week designed to get the Long Island county out
from under a current shortfall of more than $100 million. That
amount is projected to grow to more than $300 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bailout deal, the county has agreed to make about $200
million in spending cuts over the next four years while state
taxpayers will contribute $105 million in bailout funds to the
county over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The county will also be able to save tens of millions of dollars
in interest costs by refinancing some of its current $2.7 billion
in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member NIFA will consist of four appointees by Pataki,
one by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, one by Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno and another by state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki made his four appointments Friday. They were:
</P>
<P>
   - Frank Zarb, chairman and CEO of the National Association of
Securities Dealers. Zarb, who devised the county bailout plan at
Pataki's behest, will be chairman of NIFA.
</P>
<P>
   - Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority.
</P>
<P>
   - Ronald Stack, managing director and head of the Public Finance
Department of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   - Robert Smith, president and founder of Smith Affiliated
Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno also made his appointment Friday, naming Robert Wallach to
NIFA. Wallach is chairman and CEO of The Robert Plan Corp., a
financial firm specializing in automobile insurance.
</P>
<P>
   McCall and Silver have yet to name their appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County counts some of the wealthiest residents in New
York state among the 1.3 million people within its boundaries just
east of New York City. Its median annual income of $58,155 is among
the highest in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Six arrested in drug raid that nets cocaine, Ecstasy, ketamine  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAVALLETTE, N.J. (AP) - Three suspected dealers were among six
people arrested in a drug raid that netted $45,000 worth of cocaine
and designer drugs Ecstasy and ketamine, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The raid, at a modest, rented beach-block cottage, vanquished
what Ocean County Prosecutor E. David Millard said was a major
source of drugs for summer partiers at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Seized were 2&AMP;frac12; ounces of cocaine, 1,000 pills of Ecstasy, 21
vials of ketamine, eight vials of steroids, $3,500 in cash, a scale
and some plastic bags believed used for packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Michael G. Hardy, 25, and Anthony J. Valdner, 20, both of
Bayonne, and Keith M. Westcott, 27, of Spring Hill, Fla., were
charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, Ecstasy
and ketamine. Valdner was being held in the Ocean County Jail
Friday, but the others have been released on $150,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Three other occupants of the house were charged, too, but with
lesser offenses. The six all knew each other from Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
   Robin J. Schaffer, 18, of Bayonne, who had rented the house for
the month of June and then sublet rooms to the three main suspects,
was charged with possession of one vial of ketamine.
</P>
<P>
   Frank J. Figueroa, 22, of Bayonne, was also charged with
ketamine possession, and Brian T. Bowen, 25, of Bayonne, with
possession of a hypodermic syringe. They were at the house when a
narcotics agents, police dogs and members of the Ocean County
Sheriff Department's high-risk entry team entered the house at 17
Dover Ave. about 6 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Millard wouldn't say what led authorities to the house. He said
an investigation determined that the drugs were ultimately intended
for use in shore-area nightclubs. He would not name them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ecstasy is absolutely the hot drug right now,'' he said.
''We're seeing it all over the place. Its use is penetrating into
the schools, at ages that really concern us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy costs about $20 to $30 per pill, putting the value of
the drug seized in the raid at $20,000 to $30,000. Ketamine, an
animal tranquilizer that has lately gained favor in dance clubs, is
sold in vials for $30 a dose, in powder or liquid form. About
$12,000 worth of ketamine was seized.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine had a street value of about $3,500, Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea there was anything going on over there,'' said a
neighbor. ''You don't suspect these things. But I'm glad they got
'em. We don't need that around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, also known as E, XTC, and Purple Adidas, is
methylenedioxymethampetamine, a mind-altering stimulant. Ketamine,
known on the street as K, Vitamin K and Kit Kat, is a synthetic
hallucinogen.

<HEADLINE> Leach Opposes Farm Bank Expansion  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee chairman urged the
government Friday not to issue national charters that would let
regional farm-credit associations expand into each other's
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Farm Credit Administration, which oversees
the institutions, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said such expansion would
allow the banks to lend outside of farming and to cater to ''large
agricultural conglomerates to the disadvantage of the family
farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The credit administration plans to take applications for
national charters next month and issue them Jan. 1. The 179
regional associations lend to farmers and agricultural
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   The service expansion would ''lower the cost of credit to the
customer or at least keep it as reasonably priced as you can
because of the improved efficiencies,'' said Christine Quinn, a
spokeswoman for the Farm Credit Administration. She would not
comment on Leach's letter.
</P>
<P>
   The associations already compete with each other in 130
counties, and none has been hurt, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said national charters would allow the bigger associations
to cherry-pick lucrative customers from smaller rivals. A large
agricultural interest also could take control of individual
associations ''to serve its needs on a national basis, contrary to
the intent of Congress when it established the system to serve
small family farmers in a generally cooperative fashion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional banks, which compete with the associations, also
oppose the national charters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know a lot of farmers in the short run would like to have a
lot of lenders beating on each other ..., but if the farm credit
system gets into trouble that will hurt everybody, not just banks
but farmers,'' John Blanchfield of the American Bankers Association
said.
</P>
<P>
   The associations currently have about 657,000 loans outstanding
worth $70.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Gay Clergy Shakes Norway's Church  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The selection of an openly gay clergyman in
defiance of state Lutheran church guidelines raised concerns Friday
that the issue of homosexuality could split the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Norway's highest body, its 85-member national
congress, ruled in November 1997 that clergy who enter homosexual
partnerships could not hold jobs that require ordination.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Oslo Bishops' Council of clergy and laity voted 4-3
on June 15 to appoint Jens Torstein Olsen as chaplain for the
Majorstue Church. Olsen noted on his application that he was living
with a gay partner.
</P>
<P>
   The council minority appealed the decision to Trond Giske, head
of the churches and education ministry that formally employs state
church clergy. He initially said he saw no reason to reverse the
council majority's decision, but will make a final decision next
month.
</P>
<P>
   If hired, the 51-year-old Olsen would be Norway's first male
minister who is openly living with a gay partner.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo Bishop Gunnar Staalsett said he expects the ministry to
respect his council's majority, in keeping with usual practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Olsen is clearly the best qualified for the post,'' Staalsett
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the move prompted Norway's head bishop, Odd Bondevik, to say
he was calling an emergency meeting of the national bishops council
on the matter, probably in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''The appointment ... can split the Church of Norway,'' he was
quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we said the issue does not have to be a splitting factor,
we assumed that each individual bishop would be loyal to the
national church council's resolutions and the church itself,''
Bondevik was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   An anguished debate over gay clergy has already led to bitter
disputes within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Norway's only female bishop, Rosmarie Kohn, faced a
revolt by nearly one-third of her own clergy when she allowed
openly lesbian Siri Sunde to return to the pulpit. Sunde had been
barred after she married her female companion.
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriages are legal in Norway, with all the rights of
heterosexual marriages except church weddings and the right to
adopt.

<HEADLINE> Driver acquitted in 1996 Parkway bus crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - A Middlesex County jury acquitted a
New York bus driver of criminal charges in connection with a 1996
crash on the Garden State Parkway that killed one of his passengers
and seriously injured two others.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated for less than two hours before finding
Whitney Benoit, 39, of the Bronx innocent of vehicular homicide and
two assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury thought it was an accident,'' said Benoit's lawyer,
Lewis N. White 3rd of New Brunswick, after the verdict was returned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit was driving a load of 35 passengers back to New York from
Atlantic City in a snowstorm on March 2, 1996, when the bus skidded
and slid into a stand of trees in Old Bridge, toppling onto its
side before stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Suarez, 65, of Union City, was killed. Cassandra Moss, 78,
and Leah Robinson, both of New York, suffered serious injuries. The
remaining passengers were less seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Simon Rosenbach claimed
Benoit was traveling too fast for conditions and tailgating other
motorists driving slower in the storm.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judge Said To Issue Verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A judge doubling as prosecutor in a spy
trial whose fairness has been questioned will issue a verdict in
the case next week, a court official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sateq Nourani will issue a verdict in the trial of 13
Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel on July 1, the official,
Hossein Ali Amiri, told Iranian television Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 13 Jewish defendants have pleaded guilty, four have
pleaded innocent and one has said he passed information to Israel,
but did not think his action constituted espionage. Israel has said
none of the 13 was a spy.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, the United States and several European countries have
questioned the fairness of a trial that has no jury, has been
closed to the public and where the judge is also prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Zionist media and the arrogant media tried to make a
campaign to influence the trial, but the Iranian judiciary was not
at all influenced,'' Amiri said on Iranian television. The case, he
said, was studied in an atmosphere free of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nourani has spent 604 hours on the case, Amiri said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Muslims also are on trial in the case, including two who
have been detained for passing secret information to the Jews.

<HEADLINE> State weighs merging University Hospital with another in Newark  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The financial tug-of-war between the state
and one of its largest hospitals is escalating, with legislators
floating a plan to merge Newark's University Hospital with another
facility in the city to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the hospital sued the state, claiming New
Jersey had seriously miscalculated the amount of charity care it
performed. The hospital, a vital component of the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, also threatened to close free
clinics for the poor, and lay off about 150 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But in this high-stakes showdown, state officials aren't
blinking, either. They're considering a plan to merge University
Hospital with either St. Michael's Medical Center or Newark Beth
Israel Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of this is triggered by UMDNJ's crying about having to
lay off employees,'' said Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Gov.
Christie Whitman. ''There is no question the health care
marketplace has changed tremendously. We have five hospitals in the
Newark area, and three hospital systems, each offering specialties
- very expensive specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of inefficiencies in the way they deliver
services,'' McDonough said. ''On top of that, HMOs, which they
willingly hitched themselves to, don't reimburse them at the old
rates, and the population in the area hasn't grown. Something has
to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers inserted language calling for a study on whether a
merger makes sense into the new state budget, said Chuck Leitgeb, a
spokesman for Assembly speaker Jack Collins. No money has been
appropriated for it yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a feeling here that we should do the study, and it's
just that - a study,'' he said. ''We want to see if it's
economically feasible'' to merge University with another hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That has UMDNJ officials worried. They note that University
Hospital serves more indigent patients than any other facility in
New Jersey and provides more community services to Newark than any
other hospital in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, UMDNJ said University Hospital and its
affiliated medical school, New Jersey Medical School, ''have worked
hard to ensure that the citizens of Newark have access to the
highest quality health care available.''
</P>
<P>
   The university said any study ''will show that University
Hospital does not receive an unfair subsidy from the state.''
</P>
<P>
   But McDonough said total state aid to University Hospital is
nearly $250 million, far more than any other New Jersey hospital,
and termed its operations ''very inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel is owned by St. Barnabas Health Care System, which
said in a statement that it would cooperate with any state-mandated
merger study. Officials of Cathedral Healthcare System, an arm of
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark which operates St.
Michael's, said they would welcome a study.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly would be ready, willing and able to assume the
responsibilities of University Hospital, should that be the
recommendation,'' spokesman Joseph Savage said. ''We believe it
would be in the best interests of Newark and Essex County.''
</P>
<P>
   University Hospital officials predict they will lose $29 million
this year, due largely to insufficient reimbursement for caring for
patients unable to pay for their treatments, as well as declining
Medicaid payments.
</P>
<P>
   The 555-bed University Hospital sued the state in February,
saying its reimbursement to the hospital for providing charity care
for uninsured patients was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The loss contributed to a $10.9 million budget deficit last year
and will lead to an even greater one this year, the hospital
claims. It is seeking at least the same $61 million it received
last year, compared with the $52 million it is slated to receive.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital may lay off 150 staff members, end the ambulance
service it provides in Newark and Camden, and close or reduce care
at clinics for children, including a center that specializes in
pediatric AIDS, according to the lawsuit, which is still pending.

<HEADLINE> Man charged in street stabbing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - A man was stabbed to death in a street
fight over a drug deal, but his attacker was arrested almost
immediately, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   John King, 40, of Lakewood died after being stabbed in the
clavicle Thursday night outside a home at 142 Fourth Street, Ocean
County Prosecutor E. David Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   King, who had a history of drug offenses and was on probation,
had an argument with Reginald Fitzpatrick, 30, of Lakewood earlier
in the evening, Millard said. Neither was armed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, Fitzpatrick returned with an 8-inch kitchen
knife and plunged it into King's shoulder, Millard said. King was
treated at the scene and taken by ambulance to Kimball Medical
Center in Toms River, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   A 911 call alerted authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were on the scene and apprehended the suspect within
minutes of the incident,'' said Millard.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick, who is charged with murder, was being held Friday
on $250,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Industries Used in Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting to hold his congressional seat,
California Rep. Steve Kuykendall is getting fund-raising help from
a big wheel -- the chairman of the House panel that controls
transportation spending.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf is the featured guest at a Capitol Hill
breakfast Tuesday to help raise money for Kuykendall from lobbyists
and business people with a keen interest in the work of his
Transportation appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He writes the checks for the transportation industry,''
Kuykendall said. ''People want to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is one of several powerful Republicans helping to raise
money for threatened GOP incumbents with the help of the industries
the senior lawmakers oversee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, subcommittee chairmen who handle issues of
concern to the banking and defense industries officiated at
industry-backed fund-raisers for less senior members.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are pressuring their senior lawmakers to raise more
money for close races because a switch of just six seats could give
Democrats control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have used this as a very useful way for a freshman to have
the leadership demonstrate their support,'' said Kuykendall, who is
bringing in Wolf, R-Va., for the $500-a-plate breakfast, expected
to raise from $5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only can I have these fellows come out, but it gives them
a chance to tell my donors that I'm doing a good job,'' Kuykendall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers allow lawmakers to steer far more money to
their colleagues than the maximum $1,000 they can contribute from
their own campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It allows them to extract more money from the constituencies
with whom they have fund-raising influence,'' said Anthony Corrado,
a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.
''This gives the interests another opportunity to provide financial
support for the member.''
</P>
<P>
   The minority House Democrats don't have any committee chairmen
to officiate at fund-raisers, but they, too, are leaning on their
senior members to raise money. Earlier this month, Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., in line to become chairman of the powerful Ways and
Means Committee if Democrats seize control, headlined a $4 million
fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kuykendall is in a tough race against former Democratic Rep.
Jane Harman, who gave up the seat two years ago to run for
governor. With the Port of Los Angeles and the city's international
airport in his district, transportation issues are important to
Kuykendall's constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a good member and I'm trying to help him out,'' Wolf
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Rep. Richard Baker of Louisiana, chairman of
the Banking capital markets and securities subcommittee, was the
special guest at a financial services fund-raiser for freshman Rep.
Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, running for re-election in a district that
went for President Clinton by 12 points in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Armed
Services military research and development subcommittee, hosted a
$500-a-ticket defense industry reception for freshman Rep. Robin
Hayes, R-N.C., who won his first term with just 51 percent of the
vote. The event raised an estimated $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, whose district includes Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force
Base, is a junior member of the House Armed Services Committee, but
Weldon is much better known in defense circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He and I philosophically are very close,'' Hayes said. ''If
they know Curt but they don't know me, it's a very positive way to
get the word out that here's a guy we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say bringing top lawmakers to a fund raiser
makes it more attractive for industry lobbyists and political
action committee directors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to make it irresistible,'' said Larry Makinson,
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which
researches campaign fund raising. ''It's the suggestion that you're
going to have a chance to cozy up to decision makers who have
control over your industry.''

<HEADLINE> UN To Discuss Poverty at Summit  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations set an ambitious goal five
years ago to eradicate poverty as trade barriers were lowered
around the world. But the plan failed to bring the hoped-for relief
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   At a General Assembly meeting that kicks off Monday, the world
body will discuss why the number of people living in poverty has
actually gone up since its 1995 pledge despite increasing
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the special session of the U.N. body will adopt
a goal of halving the proportion of people living in extreme
poverty by the year 2015, Chilean diplomat Cristian Maquieira said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations are aware of globalization's economic
accomplishments, said Maquieira, who headed the U.N. committee that
prepared for the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are doing is looking at the other part of
globalization, the debt that it is leaving behind.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1995, focused attention
on poverty, debt relief and the impact of the global economy on the
lives of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's meeting in Geneva was supposed to gauge progress in
meeting the 1995 goal of eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, five years have brought little to cheer about, said
Juan Somavia, director general of the U.N. International Labor
Organization, and one of the instigators of the 1995 summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''In five years poverty has increased, work is more precarious
and inequality has grown,'' said Somavia, a Chilean economist.
''Five years after Copenhagen what has occurred is a strong
indictment of globalization and the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Copenhagen, world leaders gave globalization the benefit of
the doubt, Somavia said, but problems worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those that have power to act did not do enough,'' Somavia
said, referring to business, governments, international
organizations and political parties. ''We could have moved forward.
We didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can no longer give globalization the benefit of the doubt.
The results are in and it flunked.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates the number of people in absolute
poverty -- defined as living on less than a dollar a day -- has grown
to 1.2 billion from about 1 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities hosting the weeklong session have set up tight
security in anticipation of thousands of demonstrators with strong
opinions about globalization. Demonstrators are expected to gather
Sunday outside the headquarters of the World Trade Organization,
the target of mass demonstrations last year in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of world leaders is only the second time the
General Assembly has met outside of New York. They will meet at the
U.N.'s second headquarters -- the Palace of Nations in Geneva --
which also hosted the only other non-New York General Assembly
meeting, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout at the Geneva summit will be less than at Copenhagen.
The summit was expected to draw fewer than 20 heads of state,
mostly from Africa, and 94 national delegations, slightly more than
half the 186 that went to Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Maquieira said he expected the conference to agree on a document
with concrete goals -- from opportunities for work to tackling AIDS
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is often said that globalization needs a human face, but it
needs a heart as well,'' said Theo Ben Gurirab, president of the
U.N. General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor decides against charging other officers in Livoti case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal prosecutor announced Friday that her
office will not seek to prosecute police officers who testified at
the 1998 trial of a policeman convicted of violating the civil
rights of a Bronx man.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White issued a one-page statement saying
an investigation of the testimony given by some officers at the
trial of former Officer Francis X. Livoti, 41, had been closed
without bringing charges.
</P>
<P>
   She said the matter was referred to the police department for
administrative action.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman did not immediately return a telephone
message for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti, 38, is serving a 7-1/2 year prison term for his 1998
conviction by a federal jury of violating Anthony Baez's civil
rights. Livoti used a choke hold while struggling to arrest Baez on
Dec. 22, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He was kicked off the police force in February 1997 after police
officials concluded he used the banned choke hold.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, 28, an Orlando, Fla., resident visiting relatives in the
Bronx, died of asphyxia. He and his three brothers had protested
Livoti's order to quit their 1 a.m. touch football game after the
football hit a patrol car twice.
</P>
<P>
   In state and federal court, several police officers testified
that the 5-foot-8, 269-pound Baez resisted Livoti, and that Livoti
never used a choke hold on Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti was first tried in a non-jury state trial for criminally
negligent homicide. A judge ruled prosecutors failed to make their
case even though a medical examiner testified that Baez died of
asphyxia caused by choking.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also accused police witnesses of lying and claimed
their testimony appeared to be a ''nest of perjury.''

<HEADLINE> Truck Deaths Blamed on Suffocation  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Fighting to stay alive as the oxygen in the back
of a sealed truck quickly disappeared, 60 Chinese illegal
immigrants banged frantically on the side of the vehicle with their
shoes, struggled to pry open an air vent and consumed boxes of
tomatoes in a desperate bid for survival, a coroner's inquest heard
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All but two perished during the disastrous five-hour boat
crossing from the Netherlands to a British port, where the
immigrants had hoped to start a better life.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's Dutch driver, Perry Wacker, 32, from Rotterdam,
appeared in a magistrate's court Friday, charged with 58 counts of
manslaughter and counts of smuggling and attempting to smuggle the
Chinese into Britain. He was ordered into police custody until June
30.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Friday also charged two London-based Chinese who had
been held on suspicion of involvement in the smuggling gang. Chef
You Yi, 38, and 29-year-old female interpreter Ying Guo were
charged with conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants and were due
to appear at Dover magistrates court Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, police brought the 24-year-old owner of the
trucking company, identified earlier as Arie van der Spek, to court
on Friday on charges of illegal trafficking of aliens. The fifth
man being questioned was released from Dutch custody Thursday
night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour inquest into the deaths, coroner's officer
Graham Perrin gave details of the last hours of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were banging on the walls of the container in an attempt
to be heard, this proving tragically fruitless,'' Perrin testified.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people would have been gasping for breath and would go
into respiratory arrest'' as the oxygen disappeared and the
compartment filled up with carbon dioxide, exhaled by the victims,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Death would have been fairly rapid once the CO2 buildup got to
critical levels,'' Perrin said, adding that the two survivors
probably lived only because ''with people around them dying, there
would have been more air left to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   An air vent, which had allowed some daylight and fresh air into
the airtight metal compartment, was closed from the outside before
the crossing. Perrin said he believed the Chinese immigrants died
90 minutes to five hours after that vent's closure.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible details of the group's last minutes emerged as
officials in Britain and abroad intensified their efforts to
identify the dead. The bodies were discovered Sunday night by
horrified customs officials who unsealed the truck's doors a half
hour after it disembarked in Dover.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal passengers had been concealed behind a false barrier
made of wooden planks and by boxes of tomatoes -- which the
immigrants ate in an effort to avoid dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officers found the tomatoes strewn across the truck's
floor, alongside the bodies and piles of clothing. Many of the
victims had been wearing up to five layers of underwear, trousers
and shirts -- all their belongings since they were not allowed to
bring bags -- which they removed as temperatures inside soared on
what had been the hottest day of the year, Perrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths have brought international condemnation of the
criminal gangs who profit by offering desperate people in Asia,
Eastern Europe and Africa the promise of a new, prosperous life in
the West. The lucrative smuggling rings demand upfront payments
from the immigrants, who are then whisked into a Western nation by
often dangerous routes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims of this tragedy apparently came from China's
southern Fujian province, notorious for ''snake heads,'' the gangs
responsible for the human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Wah-Piow Tan, a London-based lawyer, told government authorities
Friday that seven Chinese immigrants have approached him fearful
that the victims may be family or friends. So far, police have
simply labeled the unidentified corpses with numbers: 1 through 58.
</P>
<P>
   Tan said he gave police physical descriptions and names of three
possible victims, but he said that unless the Home Office acts to
reassure the Chinese immigrants -- who themselves might be in
Britain illegally -- that they will not be deported home, many are
too afraid to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 58 corpses,'' Tan said. ''No way in a civilized
society can we allow the identity of these 58 corpses to remain
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators, working alongside translators, have also
been interviewing the two survivors -- both young men. Authorities
hope they may be the key to tracing all the racketeers involved and
to identifying their dead companions.

<HEADLINE> Italian Banker Cuccia Dies at 92  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Enrico Cuccia, the secretive high priest of Italian
banking who played a role in virtually all of the country's major
postwar business deals, died Friday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Italian Bankers' Association, Maurizio Sella,
announced Cuccia's death at an association meeting in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Mediobanca, once Italy's only merchant bank,
Cuccia was praised Friday by the country's business titans as a
pivotal figure in developing Italy's economy after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that all of us should be grateful for his
contribution to the growth of our country,'' said Italy's leading
industrialist, Fiat's Giovanni Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia was admitted to the Monzino heart hospital in Milan
Thursday, said Dr. Lorenzo Cammelli. Cuccia had spent several weeks
at Monzino.
</P>
<P>
   As co-founder and chairman of Mediobanca, Italy's premier
merchant bank, Cuccia served as the gatekeeper for mega-mergers and
as custodian for strategic chunks of stock in the handful of major
industrial groups.
</P>
<P>
   After Cuccia was forced off Mediobanca's board in 1982 when he
reached retirement age, 75, he stayed on as honorary chairman,
trying to engineer deals even as he neared 90.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when many observers thought Mediobanca was slipping
into decline, it engineered what was then the biggest hostile
takeover in Europe, Olivetti's raid of Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuccia's death is both a symbolic event and one that's likely
to have an effect on Mediobanca's own structure,'' said Riccardo
Morelli, head researcher for a banking group in Milan. ''It's
difficult to say when something might happen, but with its know-how
and prestige and its assets, it's sure to attract interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For journalists who caught up with Cuccia's stooped, thin frame
as he walked the few blocks from his Milan home to Mediobanca's
headquarters, near La Scala opera house, he had only a shy ''Good
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Nov. 24, 1907, Cuccia began his career at Italy's
central bank, then moved to the country's sprawling state
industrial holding company IRI (Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale).
</P>
<P>
   He married the IRI chairman's daughter, then left the bank when
Raffaele Mattioli, a key figure in postwar finance, tapped him to
start Mediobanca.
</P>
<P>
   The only banker ever considered serious competition for Cuccia
was Michele Sindona, whose organized crime links and banking
scandals landed him in an Italian prison cell, where he died in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia was behind the controversial 1976 sale of Fiat shares to
Libya. He then arranged a sellback which made a big profit for
Libyan Col. Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Cuccia and his wife, who died in 1996, had three children. A
private funeral was planned.

<HEADLINE> Green Party Endorses Nuclear Plan  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Green Party endorsed a deal Friday to
phase out the nation's nuclear plants, capping its two-decade
anti-nuclear campaign and averting a crisis in its governing
coalition with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite misgivings that the shutdown would be slower than the
Greens wanted, party members at a convention in Muenster voted
433-227 in favor of the compromise accord reached by the government
and utility executives this month.
</P>
<P>
   Greens leaders, including Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,
pleaded with delegates to back the deal, insisting during three
hours of debate that the junior government party should be proud of
its achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we want more. But we won't get more,'' Fischer
shouted in a speech interrupted by jeers and whistles from
hard-line anti-nuclear activists. ''I'm so fed up with this party
always tearing itself down.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls by some Greens for renegotiating the nuclear pullout were
''ridiculous,'' he said, and quibbling about details of the accord
was ''small-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejection of the accord would have cast serious doubt on the
future of the 20-month-old coalition, led by Schroeder's Social
Democrats. Some Greens leaders had warned their party that a ''no''
vote would bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   In national government for the first time in Germany, the Greens
made ending nuclear power a top goal. Schroeder and utility bosses
agreed last week to phase out the nation's 19 nuclear plants by
about 2021 -- a deal also endorsed by Environment Minister Juergen
Trittin of the Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Trittin thanked his party after the vote for supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   But the shutdown is at least two years slower than the Greens
wanted. They also failed to win promise that the phase-out would
start before the next federal election in 2002. Many delegates
spoke out against the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a happy end for the anti-nuclear movement, it's more
like a mockery,'' said Undine von Blottnitz, a veteran campaigner
against plans for an underground nuclear-waste dump in northern
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, the most prominent Greens politician, said earlier that
his party's fate was at stake in the two-day congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Greens must not only find themselves, they also have to
reinvent their agenda,'' he said in Friday's Bild newspaper. ''This
process will decide the party's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, once a student radical, has long urged the Greens to
take a more pragmatic approach to politics but has shied away from
a leadership post -- until now. On Saturday, he was seeking a seat
on a new 16-member council designed to coordinate strategy --
apparently an attempt to gain more influence inside the party.

<HEADLINE> Cops looking at possible link in 6 Brooklyn killings  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A woman strangled with her own shoelaces before
her half-naked body was dumped in a vacant lot could be the sixth
victim of a serial strangler targeting prostitutes in Brooklyn,
police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said a task force has been
formed to investigate a string of slayings that began last year.
All involved women who were strangled, either with their own
shoelaces or electrical cords, in the Williamsburg or
Bedford-Stuyvesant sections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're treating all these homicides as possibly being linked,''
Safir told reporters. Police, he added, ''do have some suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to discuss the case further.
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence suggests that three of the women may have had sex
with the same man shortly before their deaths, said a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official
described the victims as ''street people known to have engaged in
prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was identified as Patricia Sullivan, 49, whose
body, naked from the waist down, was discovered Thursday afternoon
lying on a mattress in a lot in Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The first killing came in August of 1999, when the body of
Vivian Caraballo, 26, was discovered on the roof of a Williamsburg
building after she was strangled with a sneaker shoelace. Found
three weeks later on the roof of a building only two blocks away
was Joanna Feliciano, 35; she had been choked with sneaker laces
and speaker wire, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, Rhonda Tucker, 21, was found inside a
Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment, strangled by a cord. Later the same
month, Katrina Miles, 34, was strangled and had her throat slashed
before being discovered inside another apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And this past February, firefighters called to a fire under the
Williamsburg Bridge found the decomposed body of Laura Nusser, a
44-year-old victim strangled with an electrical cord.

<HEADLINE> State trains teachers to stop bullies  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - School bullies may soon have a harder
time taking home other students' lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission on Children held anti-bully workshops for
teachers this week, and a state lawmaker plans to reintroduce
legislation next year to raise awareness of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The string of unanticipated and startling shootings around the
country led to a search of what we could do,'' said Elaine
Zimmerman, the commission's executive director. ''We're trying to
help the state look at issues of safety in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman also said several incidents in Connecticut this year
have alarmed teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents included the March arrest of a Norwalk woman
accused of arming her sons with a hammer to fight bullies and the
February arrests and expulsions of several Trumbull High School
wrestling team members for hazing a student with a learning
disability.
</P>
<P>
   At the Legislative Office Building on Friday, Swedish professor
Dan Olweus told about 60 educators about his program to address
bullying behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Olweus, who now works for the University of Bergen in Norway,
said his program reduced bullying incidents by 50 percent in a
study of 2,500 Norwegian students between 1983 and 1985. Subsequent
studies in the United States, England and Germany also produced
positive results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His bullying prevention program includes increased awareness of
the behavior, school questionaires, class rules against bullying
and discussions among teachers, parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   Olweus said peer mediation programs don't work because they give
too much responsibility to students and because they give the bully
negotiating power that he shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited research indicating that bullies are more prone to
getting criminal records when they grow up. In one study, nearly 60
percent of the bullies studied were convicted of at least one crime
by the time they were 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just childish behavior,'' Olweus said. ''It has
long-term implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers at the workshop said they were looking forward
to bringing the program back to their schools for review. Some of
them said the problem has been ignored for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Retired physical education Neil Beaulieu wasn't at the workshop,
but he knew about the problem. He helped create a bully prevention
program at Timothy Edwards Middle School in South Windsor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a lot of incidents where kids were cruel to each
other,'' Beaulieu, of Enfield, said. ''It was one of those things
that bothered me for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the program, which still exists, was a success because
students and teachers were more aware of the problem and played
roles in preventing bullying behavior.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Wade A. Hyslop Jr., D-New London, said Friday that he
wants to reintroduce legislation next year to create a statewide
program for bullying prevention. The proposal would help teachers
create such programs in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   A similar proposal died in the General Assembly this year for
lack of action.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 92; Dow Gains 29  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks turned meek Friday giving back
all their gains for the week as a warning about the outlook for
online retailer Amazon.com sent the Nasdaq composite index down
more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chips held their own in light trading as the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 28.63 at 10,404.75. For the week, Wall
Street's best-known indicator slipped 44.55.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 91.50 points,
or 2.3 percent, to 3,845.34. The Nasdaq lost 15.22 points for the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.70 at 1,441.48.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Nasdaq lower was Amazon.com, which plummeted $8.125,
or 19.3 percent, to $33.875 after an influential analyst warned of
risks facing the online retailer. Lehman Brothers analyst Ravi
Suria described the company as having ''extremely weak and
deteriorating'' credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This emphasized again that the companies at some point have to
show some visible operating income and the window for funding these
companies is getting shorter,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market
strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks falling Friday included Yahoo!, off
$6.375 at $125.313.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in the technology sector were somewhat offset by
gains in the semiconductor shares. Rambus' stock rose $17.563 to
$114.688 after the memory chip maker said that it ended its patent
infringement lawsuit against Hitachi Ltd. Hitachi agreed to a
worldwide licensing agreement on a variety of Rambus products.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light Friday as investors watched their moves ahead
of Federal Reserve's regular meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While
there have been signs that the economy has been slowing in response
to the Fed's six interest rate hikes in the past year, traders are
hesitant to make investment commitments when the Fed may still move
to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market hates uncertainty and we have a big uncertainty in
front of us,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''When people are
confused on Wall Street, they often keep their hands in their
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also worry that a slowing U.S. economy will eat away
at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those fears were eased after markets closed Thursday
with the release of better-than-expected earnings from computer
chip maker Micron Technology. The report marked the third straight
quarter of strong profits following two years of red ink. Micron
shares, which fell 4 percent Thursday on fears of disappointing
earnings, rose $2.125 Friday to $88.
</P>
<P>
   International Home Foods gained $5.25 to $20.625 after it
announced it was being bought for $1.6 billion in cash and stock by
ConAgra Inc., which owns the Healthy Choice, Butterball, Orville
Redenbacher, Hunt's and Swiss Miss brands. International Home Foods
owns Chef Boyardee, PAM cooking spray, and Gulden's Mustard.
</P>
<P>
   ConAgra fell 6.7 percent, or by $1.375, to $18.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. and Bear Stearns
Merchant Banking announced the $2.4 billion purchase of Johns
Manville Corp., a manufacturer and marketer of building products.
Manville's shares were up 93.7 cents to $13.25.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange where consolidated volume came to 1.23
billion shares, up from 1.22 billion shares in Thursday's session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 4.60 at 510.41.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.83 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.35 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> AMA Begins Patient Rights Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American Medical Association has begun a
grassroots campaign to persuade three Republican senators in tough
re-election bids to drop their opposition to a White House-backed
patient rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected by the Senate June 8, the White House-backed measure
would give Americans broad new authority to sue their HMOs for
denial of care. The vote was 51-48, with four Republicans joining
44 Democrats in support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the nation's largest physicians group hit the
ground in Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis this week for newspaper
and television interviews. They also placed an advertisement in the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch admonishing Republican Sen. John Ashcroft,
''you have the opportunity to deliver long overdue protections to
the patients of Missouri and across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reardon, the group's immediate past president, said the
performance will be repeated in Washington state, home of GOP Sen.
Slade Gorton. A trip to Michigan to prod GOP Sen. Spencer Abraham
also is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to let the public know how important this is, and that
their senator can and should make a difference,'' Reardon said.
''If the Senate does not do the right thing and pass this bill of
rights, we will make it an election issue this fall. We intend to
go to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has also run ads thanking the four Republicans who voted
for the measure, Sens. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, Lincoln Chafee
of Rhode Island, John McCain of Arizona and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, written in response to HMO horror stories, is
aimed at getting patients easier access to emergency rooms and
specialists, and would allow women to see gynecologists without
referrals from their primary care physicians. Patients would also
get expanded rights to sue their health plans if harmed when
coverage was denied, and all 161 million Americans with private
health insurance would get the protections.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation sponsored by Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.,
and John Dingell, D-Mich., cleared the House last year with the
support of most Democrats and many Republicans. In the Senate,
however, majority Republicans last year forced passage of a less
sweeping measure that covered far fewer people and did not expand
rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who backed last year's GOP-sponsored bill, issued a
statement Wednesday saying he is committed to reaching bipartisan
compromise this year. Ashcroft last year pushed an amendment to
place HMO reviews on strict timetables with penalties for
noncompliance, and he also proposed a limited right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Noting his amendment was backed by the AMA, the statement from
Ashcroft's office said he ''supports a law that puts doctors and
patients in charge of their health care, gets patients care when
they need it, and protects Americans' access to affordable high
quality care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's expected Democratic opponent, Missouri Gov. Mel
Carnahan, last week challenged Ashcroft to reverse his vote against
the White House-backed proposal, saying, ''A switch in one vote --
yours -- would guarantee passage of the Norwood-Dingell Bill and
would guarantee working families meaningful protections from HMO
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, an Ashcroft campaign spokesman accused Carnahan of
playing politics with health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfortunate that Mel Carnahan is trying to partisanize
an issue that is so important working families,'' spokesman David
James said.

<HEADLINE> Hastert: Patients Rights Bill Close  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Dennis Hastert said Friday that
marathon talks had brought House and Senate Republicans close to
agreement on a patients' rights bill, but one GOP rebel swiftly
declared the terms unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Rep. Charles Norwood, brought into the negotiations
Thursday night at Hastert's request, said, ''what I heard will
never pass muster with either the Republicans or Democrats'' who
voted for a White House-backed bill last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything less than full protection for all patients cannot be
taken seriously,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict surfaced after a remarkable nine-hour bargaining
session, punctuated by late-night deliveries of pizza, ice cream
and doughnuts for lawmakers and aides, in the Capitol office of
Senate Republican Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have agreements'' in key areas, subject to the
drafting of formal language, Hastert said in an interview in his
office several hours after the bargaining broke up around 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not speaking for Mr. Norwood, but for the rest (of the
Republican negotiators) I think we're agreed this is something we
can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
under the proposal, HMOs currently regulated by the federal
government would be required to provide protections to patients,
such as access to emergency care and medical specialists.
State-regulated HMOs would also be covered, although each governor
would be empowered to opt out of the federal system if the state
had equivalent laws on the books protecting patients. Any such
decision could be challenged in state court under this approach.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for giving patients the right to sue in
federal court for denial of care, after exhausting a system of
internal and external appeals. There would be limits on punitive
damages, and possibly on compensatory damages as well, and class
action suits would be prohibited. Employers would be shielded from
lawsuits, unless they were directly responsible for a decision to
deny care.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans decided to add several provisions they
said would increase access to insurance, including complete
deductibility for the cost of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said negotiators
had also agreed to a provision, sought by the American Medical
Association, requiring HMOs to make payment of claims within 45
days. The rule would apply in states without any existing
requirements for timely payment of claims.
</P>
<P>
   The concession to the doctors' lobby comes at a critical time,
with Hastert and House Republicans seeking AMA backing on the their
Medicare prescription drug legislation as well as the patients'
rights measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Hastert said ''it is my hope we can get (the
bill) to the floor next week.'' He added the schedule is heavy,
though, and the timetable appeared optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat scoffed at any talk of a bill backed only by
Republicans. ''A sham bill won't pass the House and it won't be
signed into law by the president,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass. ''In fact, I believe that a partisan Republican bill that
fails to provide patients the protections they need and deserve
will be very difficult to pass in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Hastert said that Norwood had wanted to see
formal draft language before deciding whether to back the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But a short while later, Norwood issued a statement. ''After
attending last night's meeting, I'm afraid they probably have
several weeks' more work to do before there's even a chance of a
bill,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, John Stone, said Norwood had made similar
comments before leaving Nickles' office.
</P>
<P>
   The long session in Nickles office brought together House and
Senate negotiators who have been laboring for months over the issue
that has exposed divisions not just between the parties, but also
among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining with Democrats appeared productive at first, but it
then stalled. When Democrats took the issue to the Senate floor
recently, Republicans sought to produce a House-Senate GOP
compromise.

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian Nazi Trial Reopens  </HEADLINE>
By LIUDAS DAPKUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- The trial of alleged Nazi war criminal
Aleksandras Lileikis resumed Friday as the bedridden 93-year-old
defendant followed the proceedings from his apartment by
closed-circuit TV.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis, who could also be seen by participants in the packed
courtroom on a large screen, lay unshaven in bed with a compress on
his head. He gasped for air as he answered questions from the judge
about his marital status.
</P>
<P>
   His niece rushed to his side, weeping as she handed pills to her
uncle. She continually interrupted the session, stepping into view
of the camera and asking Lileikis how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the court adjourned to allow Lileikis' doctors to
take his pulse and perform a cardiogram. After a short break, his
doctors said Lileikis had a severe headache and was unable to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Algimantas Pivoriunas postponed the trial, which had
lasted for only half an hour, until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis, a former resident of Norwood, Mass., is charged with
genocide for allegedly handing over scores of Jews to be executed
during the 1941-44 German occupation, when he headed the
Nazi-backed Vilnius security police.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, the first Nazi war crimes proceedings in the former
Soviet Union, first got under way in 1998, but was repeatedly
delayed on health grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lileikis, who lived in the United States for 40 years after
World War II, returned to Lithuania in 1995 as a U.S. court was
moving to revoke his citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups have sharply criticized the repeated delays of the
trial. They say the former Soviet republic is trying to avoid
confronting its past under Nazi rule, when some 240,000 Lithuanian
Jews were massacred.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Ahead of Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau is nearly two weeks ahead of
schedule in completing this year's count because of a
better-than-expected response from the public, and not because it
is sacrificing quality for speed, Census director Kenneth Prewitt
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Thursday of the House Government Reform Committee's
census panel, Republicans questioned the accuracy of the Census
2000 head count. Subcommittee chairman Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla.,
said some census-takers may have been pressured to finish early by
the lure of incentive programs, or were forced to take improper
procedural shortcuts -- including marking answers for people
</P>
<P>
   About 120 million households in the country got census forms.
Prewitt said Friday his agency is completing their work so fast in
part because they got nearly 80 million, or 66 percent, of the
forms back by mail. The bureau budgeted for a 61 percent response
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 million had to be reached at the door. Prewitt
decided not to make any cuts in the planned work force of 440,000
part-time census-takers responsible for tracking down the missing
forms, so there were more workers available to track down fewer
households.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that they worked any faster, it's just that they had
less work to do,'' Prewitt said Friday. He has said that the bureau
incentive program had nothing to do with how fast data is
collected, but on other statistical and administrative tasks it
performs.
</P>
<P>
   Census-takers hit the field on April 28, and as of June 18, had
contacted more than 99 percent of the households that did not
respond. During the 1990 census, census-takers began on May 2 and
by June 18 of that year had finished more than 89 percent of the
workload.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running more than 9 points ahead of 1990,'' Census
spokesman Steve Jost said. ''It's good, but it's not a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's spokesman, Chip Walker, said he had not yet reviewed
those figures, but countered the GOP's concerns were based on
worker complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''These problems have been raised to us by Census bureau
employees in the field who feel they may have had to sacrifice in
order to meet deadlines,'' Walker said. He said his office received
new complaints Friday from workers in Los Angeles and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt also said that it was important to get cases completed
faster because information in considered less accurate the longer
past April 1 it is collected. The Census is supposed to be a
snapshot of what the population looked like on April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau will use the extra time to double-check the
quality of the data it collects, Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pressing the Census Bureau for the most accurate
head count possible. The bureau is also in the midst of a separate
randomly sampled survey of 314,000 households, from which the
results will be used to statistically adjust the actual head count.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the second, ''sampled'' survey say it will give a
better estimate of the segments of the population missed in prior
counts -- including minorities, the poor, and inner-city residents,
which all tend to vote Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Court Sides With EPA on Smog Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court is allowing the government to
implement a plan to reduce air pollution that drifts from the
Midwest to the Northeast, the Environmental Protection Agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, designed to force more controls on coal-burning
power plants, has been bitterly contested by states that contend
the effect of traveling smog has been exaggerated and pollution
controls to cut it back would cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   It also was challenged by utilities, manufacturers and the
trucking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that 19 states, all east of the Mississippi,
now have four months to submit to the EPA plans for reducing
nitrogen oxide, an ingredient in smog, by May 2003. Some of the
states will have to impose tougher controls than others: Much of
the traveling smog problem has been blamed on tall utility
smokestacks in the Midwest, Ohio Valley and parts of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan was the lead plaintiff in the case. State officials
there had not decided whether to appeal to the Supreme Court, said
Ken Silfven of the state Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a shame that a policy that is not based on
science should be allowed to become the law of the land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner called Thursday's decision from
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ''a major
environmental victory for everyone living throughout the Eastern
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Browner said the regulation was intended to reduce smog-related
illnesses, including bronchitis and childhood asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means that over a hundred million people will now breathe
healthier air as the result of significant reductions in harmful
emissions from the most polluting power plants throughout the
region,'' she said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Washington-based
environmental group Clean Air Trust, said the court decision
''means that big, dirty, coal-fired electric power plants will have
to clean up -- and clean up pronto.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is letting states decide whether to crack down on power
plant emissions or use some other method, such as attacking
pollution from the exhausts of cars and trucks. But it says going
after utilities will in many cases be the cheapest way for states
to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision came in response to a request for
reconsideration of a March decision by a three-judge panel. That
panel had ruled in EPA's favor on rules for 19 of the 22 states
that EPA identified as causing downwind pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   The full appellate court upheld that earlier decision and lifted
a stay that had blocked implementation of the request for nitrogen
oxide-limiting plans.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North
Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   The case is Michigan v. EPA, 98-1497

<HEADLINE> State seizes 1954 tank from deadbeat dad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PAINTED POST, N.Y. (AP) - The state tax department pulled out
its big guns Thursday night, seizing a British tank from a father
as collateral for the $6,000 he owes for child support.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle belonging to Jon Baglini was an apparently
street-legal, 1954 Ferret Mark 1 tank, a light, quick
reconnaissance vehicle powered by a Rolls Royce engine and capable
of reaching 55 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Tax Department agents seized the tank and a less
glamorous vehicle, Baglini's 1987 Chevrolet pickup, from his
garage. If he doesn't redeem the vehicles by paying off the back
support, they'll be auctioned July 15.
</P>
<P>
   A 1956 Ferret was recently offered for sale on the Internet for
$14,000, the tax department said.
</P>
<P>
   The unique find underscored what tax and finance commissioner
Arthur J. Roth said is an ongoing effort to hold deadbeat parents
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfortunate, but all too frequent, that seizures of this
sort must take place before those obligations are fulfilled,'' Roth
said. ''The message is simple: if you're a deadbeat, pay up.''
</P>
<P>
   Support collections have increased by an average of nearly 11
percent a year since 1994, yielding more than $1 billion in 1999
for the first time in state history, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Painted Post is in Steuben County, 74 miles south of Rochester.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Fight GOP Disclosure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats got some help from unusual quarters
-- the National Right to Life Committee -- as they fight a GOP bill
that would require well-established nonprofit organizations to
disclose the names of people who pay for any political activity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complain that the Republican bill is too broad,
probably unconstitutional and intended to destroy a legitimate
effort to force newly popular, often secretive political groups to
disclose their donors.
</P>
<P>
   They also complain that the GOP bill covers labor unions but not
corporations and would not require disclosure for most spending
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Right to Life group, which lobbies for anti-abortion
legislation, is one of hundreds, if not thousands, that would be
affected by the legislation, which requires most nonprofits to
disclose donations and spending for political activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe that the Constitution permits our elected
representatives to demand that groups of citizens, organized to
promote a cause, must report to government bureaucrats every
instance in which they dare to utter the name of a federal
politician to multiple listeners,'' said a letter Friday from
leaders of Right to Life sent to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The group's opposition will complicate efforts to pass the bill,
predicted Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who wrote the original
legislation, which only covered groups that organize under newly
popular section 527 of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to have a difficulty getting Republican votes
and they won't get more than one or two Democratic votes,'' Doggett
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP bill was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee
Thursday on a party line vote and moves to the House floor,
probably on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative is more limited. It would require
that groups disclose their donors and spending for most political
activity, but only within two or three months of an election.
</P>
<P>
   It would also cover year-round activity by section 527 groups,
who are by definition political. Under current law, these groups do
not have to tell the public anything about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All of these groups -- no matter where they fall in the tax code
-- manage to avoid reporting their contributors and spending to the
Federal Election Commission by avoiding use of words such as ''vote
for'' and ''vote against'' in their ads and materials. As far as
the FEC is concerned, these groups say, they are simply discussing
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP bill was crafted by Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., who could
not be reached for comment Friday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Russian Walks Out of U.N. Council  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia's U.N. ambassador walked out of the
Security Council on Friday after its members refused to allow
Yugoslavia to participate in a debate on the Balkans, saying
''gagging people's mouths'' sets a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ''To discuss the Balkan problems without the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is nonsense,'' Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov
said after the 15-member council voted 7-4 with four abstentions to
bar Yugoslavia's U.N. envoy from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that less than half the council supported the exclusion
of Yugoslavia, Jovanovic later called the vote ''a moral victory
... and a confirmation that U.S. policy of aggression against
Yugoslavia ... is in conflict with the majority of countries in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke had urged council members to
exclude Yugoslavia's representative Vladislav Jovanovic, saying
''he represents a government whose senior leadership has been
indicted for war crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We recommend that the council state clearly and unequivocally
that it rejects the policies of hatred and war espoused by the
Belgrade regime, that it does not tolerate abuses of human rights,
and fully supports the efforts of the war crimes tribunal for
former Yugoslavia to prosecute all -- I repeat all -- of those who
have been indicted,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote to bar Yugoslavia, Lavrov reminded council
members that under the U.N. Charter, even a state that is not in
the United Nations has a right to participate when it is a party to
a situation under discussion in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''A very dangerous precedent has thus been created when states
that are unpalatable for political reasons are being isolated from
participation in the work of the United Nations,'' Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gagging people's mouths is not the best way to discuss the
acute international problems in this way,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Stating that without Yugoslavia's participation the council
meeting had lost ''its practical meaning,'' Lavrov then got up and
left the council chamber. A lower-ranking diplomat sat down in
Russia's seat shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-4-4 vote reflected not only the long-standing divisions in
the council over Yugoslavia but uneasiness among some of the 10
elected council members over excluding a key party to a matter
before the council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China have traditionally been Yugoslavia's strongest
supporters on the council. The United States, supported by its
Western allies, has opposed any dealings with the Yugoslav
government led by President Slobodan Milosevic, who has been
indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's debate, diplomats said China's deputy ambassador
Shen Guofang walked out as NATO secretary-general Javier Solana
began speaking about the Balkans. Salana is also the European
Union's foreign and security policy chief. A junior Chinese
diplomat sat at the council table until Solana's speech ended when
Shen returned, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said afterward he didn't realize the Chinese ambassador
had left, and called it a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the council chamber, Russia's Lavrov also
criticized the U.N. war crimes prosecutor for Yugoslavia, Carla del
Ponte, for acting politically and refusing to consider prosecuting
NATO for what he called its ''flagrant'' violations of the use of
force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Arnoldo Listre, explaining his
abstention, said it did not imply any support or sympathy for the
Belgrade regime but was based ''on serious doubts'' about the
appropriateness of denying Yugoslavia's participation.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Volodymyr Yel'Chenko, who supported
Yugoslavia's participation, noted that last week representatives of
rebel groups fighting in the Congo sat at the council table,
reflecting the importance of including all key players to a
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The procedural vote overshadowed the briefing by Carl Bildt, the
special envoy to the Balkans of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
warned that if international peacekeeping troops left the Balkans
today, there would ''in all probability be war tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia and Kosovo ''are just the most acute fracture zones,'' he
said, noting that Montenegro and the federal authorities in
Belgrade are also ''on a slow but steady course towards a
collision.''

<HEADLINE> The New York Times, state and city sign agreement for new building  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The New York Times has signed a nonbinding
agreement with state and city officials to build a new 40-story
headquarters in the Times Square area, the company announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new offices would be on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st
Streets, across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The new tower would allow the newspaper to consolidate
operations now scattered among a half dozen buildings. The New York
Times Company, from which Times Square took its name, has been
headquartered at 229 W. 43rd St. since 1913. If the project goes
forward, the Times Company plans to sell that building.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding memorandum of understanding must be approved by
the Times Company's Board of Directors before construction can
begin, said Catherine Mathis, a spokeswoman for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If it is approved, construction would begin in 2001 and the
company expects to occupy the new building in 2004. The Times
Company expects to select an architect in September, after
conducting a design competition.
</P>
<P>
   No financial terms were disclosed, but published reports citing
executives involved in the talks said that under the accord, the
newspaper would pay almost $100 million for the right to develop
the site. In turn, the city is expected to provide a series of tax
breaks.

<HEADLINE> Whitman proposes to usurp local power in Camden  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey would provide Camden with a host
of new state aid and business incentives. That's the carrot. The
stick? A nearly complete takeover of city operations, under a
landmark proposal unveiled by the Whitman administration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A state-appointed city manager would take over hiring and firing
and could adopt and repeal ordinances under the unprecedented
legislation specifically targeting New Jersey's poorest city, state
officials said. City officials would be relegated to a mere
advisory role under the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The state needs to usurp the mayor and City Council's power to
stem the fiscal bleeding in Camden, which has suffered under a
worsening budget crisis in recent years, said Gov. Christie
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a last resort, but a necessary one when a
municipality's financial recovery defies other remedies,'' she said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, dubbed the Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic
Revitalization Act, also contains incentives for economic
redevelopment. They include at least $12.5 million in financing
assistance, corporate tax rebates, extra state aid to close a city
budget gap, and a local tax rate freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also create a citizens advisory board to keep
community activists abreast of the new manager's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But a Camden councilman and a municipal lobbyist say they oppose
the measure. They said it would disenfranchise voters and open the
door to state takeover of other towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''What she's trying to do is, delegate City Council to a
ceremonial position,'' said Councilman Gilbert Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would effectively deprive citizens of their right to
local government,'' said Bill Dressel, director of the New Jersey
League of Municipalities. ''It's totally unprecedented for
municipal government in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Camden Mayor Milton Milan could not be reached for comment. He
did not return two telephone messages left with an aide Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Milan is under indictment for extortion, money laundering and
mail fraud. Federal authorities said Milan accepted payoffs and
gifts from city contractors and took bribes from organized crime
figures.
</P>
<P>
   He has opposed limited state control in the past, threatening to
place the city in bankruptcy last year before he accepted a deal to
allow a state financial review board some oversight of operations.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the state Local Finance Board gave state officials the
ability to approve all city spending, contracts and collective
bargaining agreements. State supervisors can limit debt, authorize
any refinancing and hire and fire non-Civil Service employees.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's new initiative would expand the state's control over
the city even more.
</P>
<P>
   Community Affairs Commissioner Jane Kenny said she's not
surprised by the opposition. But she hopes that community members
anxious for the city's long delayed rebirth will blunt criticism
from city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect there will be people who continue to be cool because
this threatens the status quo. But there are others who have asked
us time and time again for the state to be more aggressive,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure combines punitive measures with incentives for
economic revitalization to smooth ruffled feathers. Only by
rebuilding Camden's tax base can true recovery take place, the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't continue to pour new resources into a municipality
without assuring local citizens and the state's taxpayers that the
funds are well spent,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate is unclear in the Legislature. Kenny's hopes for
quick passage are unlikely, as there are only two voting sessions
scheduled before the summer recess begins at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said Friday the
speaker wants to read the bill before taking a position. A
spokeswoman for Senate President Donald DiFrancesco said she too
was unfamiliar with the details.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Roberts Jr., D-Camden, whose district
includes the city, said he is concerned about the scope of the
state's proposed takeover. He said he is also displeased with the
governor's handling of the issue, but did not close the door on
supporting it.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies Vieques Bombing Motion  </HEADLINE>
By HILARIO DE LEON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A federal judge denied a motion
Friday to halt the U.S. Navy's plans to resume exercises with
non-explosive bombs this weekend on its training ground at Vieques
island.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since news was published of the Navy's
plans to mount its biggest exercise since an April 1999 bombing
accident killed a civilian on the range. Five warships would fire
up to 600 shells at the range and aircraft would drop between 550
and 830 dummy bombs -- include 500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs
during two to five days of exercises starting Saturday, according
to plans filed by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Juan Perez Gimenez said the exercises -- on a
bombing range that takes up one third of the island -- did not pose
any danger to the people of Vieques, as was argued by lawyers for
the Trustees for the Historical Conservation of Vieques and the
Vieques Union to Protect the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say five decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, stunted tourism, destroyed fishing grounds
and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's decision, lawyers Fermin Arraiza and Pedro
Varela said it would be up to the people of Puerto Rico to unseat
the Navy through a continuing civil disobedience campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The courts are not prepared to judge the Navy and deliver
justice for the people of Vieques,'' Arraiza declared.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing accident, protesters occupied the bombing
range and camped out there for a year until federal agents
dislodged them last month.
</P>
<P>
   Since then more than 200 protesters have been arrested for
trespassing. Many militants say they plan to invade the range on
Saturday, to stop the Navy again.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of U.S. religious groups, including the National Council
of Churches and the United Church of Christ, have denounced the
planned bombing and urged President Clinton to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs instead of live
munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the island's 9,400
residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected next year. If
the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad.

<HEADLINE> Naval aviators pay tribute to one of their own killed in crash  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - Lt. David Erick Bergstrom was a
skilled flier, a leader and a good friend with a touch of mischief
in him, fellow naval aviators recalled fondly at a memorial service
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old radar intercept officer from Annandale was one
of two aviators killed during the crash of an F-14 Tomcat jet at an
air show crash in Pennsylvania last weekend. The men were based at
Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''After flying with him once, I knew he was special,'' Cmdr.
Luke Parent said during the service at Oceana's chapel. Parent is
commanding officer of Fighter Squadron 101, the Tomcats training
squadron in which Bergstrom was an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   A hard worker who was unflappable under pressure, Bergstrom
earned the respect of his squadron mates and superiors, Parent
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the consummate professional, in the ground and in the
air,'' Parent told the chapel full of sailors in dress whites and
civilian mourners in black.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Loran Hayes said Bergstrom also was a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes recalled how he and Bergstrom, as ''sun-burned, half-drunk
aviators,'' once got into trouble by riding around Greece on
scooters - and running into their skipper.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstrom also was a man of honor who was dedicated to duty,
Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a truly great guy he was,'' said Hayes, pausing to choke
back tears. ''We will be better people for knowing him. We will
take a little bit of him with us wherever we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aviators described Bergstrom as a cheerful person who was
easy to confide in, even about subjects as intimate as faith and
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, two sailors walked to the front of
the chapel, faced a portrait of Bergstrom and slowly raised their
right arms in salute as ''Taps'' played in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Then, everyone filed outside to watch four F-14s fly overhead in
the ''missing man'' formation, with one jet pulling away to
symbolize the lost aviator.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of spectators witnessed Sunday's crash at Willow Grove
Naval Air Station near Philadelphia that also killed pilot Lt.
William Joseph Dey, 30, of Hightstown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the F-14 banked sharply, sheared trees and
plunged to the ground just outside the air station's boundary,
bursting into flames. The cause of the crash has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Dey also was an instructor in Fighter Squadron 101, and a
memorial service was held for him Wednesday at Oceana.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstrom followed his father's footsteps into flying fighter
jets. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1992 and became a
radar intercept officer, taking over the rear seat of the
supersonic F-14 Tomcat and flying more than 20 missions in Bosnia
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he became one of four aviators in the Atlantic
Fleet to appear in air shows as part of the elite F-14 Tomcat
Demonstration Team.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstrom logged more than 1,500 flight hours, including 1,000
in the carrier-based F-14.
</P>
<P>
   Bergstrom is survived by his parents, retired Navy Capt. James
Bergstrom and Catherine Bergstrom, and his sisters, Karen and
Patty.

<HEADLINE> Deal May Free Fiji Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Gunmen holding 31 political hostages struck a
deal with Fiji's military rulers Friday that should end the
captives' 36-day ordeal soon, both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators achieved a breakthrough after six days of talks,
agreeing to terms under which Fiji's next government would be
formed, the two sides said. The military commander, Commodore Frank
Bainimarama, and rebel leader George Speight planned to sign the
accord Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini early
Saturday played down the chances of the accord being signed
Saturday. He told Radio Fiji the parties would meet to review a
final draft of the accord and that it would be only be signed if
both sides agreed to the wording.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages could be released any time after the signing,
possibly within hours, said Metuisela Mua, one of Speight's
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his rebels have held former Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and 30 members of his ousted government hostage in Fiji's
parliament compound since May 19. Chaudhry was the first ethnic
Indian prime minister of this Pacific island nation, and the ethnic
Fijian rebels say they staged their coup because Chaudhry's
government was trampling on the rights of the indigenous majority
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the coup attempt, some indigenous Fijians
launched attacks on ethnic Indians, looting homes and businesses.
Fiji's military quickly took over and declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have been negotiating since with the rebels,
trying to agree on details of an interim civilian government that
would presumably lead Fiji to new elections within two years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of six straight days of talks, Jo Brown, a government
negotiator, announced Friday: ''We have now reached an agreement.''
Rebel spokesman Jo Nata confirmed Brown's statement.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of the accord, however, was still being hammered out
Friday night, and details were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Virimati Chaudhry, wife of the deposed prime minister, said of
the possibility he was about to be released: ''I am extremely
excited and can hardly wait to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal should end the standoff in parliament. But it also
could leave Fiji open to widespread criticism and even economic
sanctions by other countries: The accord is expected to scrap some
of Fiji's democratic traditions, reduce the rights of its ethnic
Indian minority, grant an amnesty to the gunmen who captured the
hostages and disable the already struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   The military already has promised Speight the removal of
Chaudhry's government and changes in the constitution to strip
Indians of the political power they shared with the Fijian
majority. Those conditions are expected to be part of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between Fiji's poor indigenous majority and its
relatively affluent ethnic Indian minority has spurred accusations
in the international community that the once-idyllic island nation
has descended into racism and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fijians of Indian descent, who make up about 44 percent of
the population of 812,000, already are fleeing the country. News
reports of the agreement to end the crisis weren't expected to
persuade them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Indians are not secure in Fiji,'' said Shakeel Tobrez, a
17-year-old student standing outside a mosque Friday during prayers
for the Muslim Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cancerous, this ethnic violence,'' said 60-year-old
businessman Mohamed Rafiq.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand and the United States have threatened
economic sanctions if Fiji is not restored to democracy. Australian
trade unions have refused to handle cargo to and from Fiji,
freezing much of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
   Such measures have helped send the economy into a downward
spiral, with the tourism, garment and sugar industries reporting
paralysis at the cost of millions of dollars a day and thousands of
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, the nation's cash crop, is at the core of Fiji's
troubles. Indian farmers built the industry by operating
plantations on land that is communally owned by indigenous Fijians
and leased at low rates set by English colonial law.
</P>
<P>
   Those leases are due to be renewed, and the refusal by
Chaudhry's government to accept demands for higher rents on the
land enraged many Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiji Times newspaper reported Friday that the rebels allowed
its journalists to view the hostages from a distance a day earlier.
The paper described Chaudhry as looking ''haggard and dejected.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Refuses Elian Review  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday unanimously
refused to reconsider the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez,
paving the way for the boy's possible return to Cuba next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the
boy's Miami relatives' request for a rehearing and emphatically
said it would not look at the case again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any further requests for stays or for injunctive relief should
be directed to the Supreme Court,'' said the ruling, written by
Circuit Judge J.L. Edmondson. He said the appeals court will not
grant any further motions for a stay -- even putting the word
''not'' in boldface and large letters.
</P>
<P>
   The court said its earlier stay requiring Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, to keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States
will dissolve at 4 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based court had ruled against
the relatives earlier this month. The decision to grant a rehearing
before the full court had to be approved by seven of the 12 judges;
none of the 12 even asked for a vote on the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has
acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said in Washington. ''Now that the court has
conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and
son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said the
family's attorneys will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court
on Monday. Although the Supreme Court hears about 1 percent of the
appeals it received, he said the family is not daunted by the long
odds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family does not feel defeated and they still have faith in
God that the Supreme Court will accept the appeal in the same way
God saved Elian from drowning,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine Supreme Court justices must agree to hear an
appeal. A single justice can grant a stay, or can opt to refer the
question of a stay to the full court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is
the justice assigned to hear emergency matters from the 11th
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gregory Craig, attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
said he would meet with his client over the weekend to talk about
his plans for the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel is grateful that the 11th Circuit has denied the
petition for the hearing and has lifted all stays and all
injunctions as of Wednesday afternoon of next week,'' Craig said
outside his Washington offices.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Perlmutter, a University of Miami law professor, said it
is highly unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn the
appellate decision or even grant a hearing. He said the 11th
Circuit's earlier decision was based on a Supreme Court decision in
another case and it is not likely to reverse its course.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family should recognize that there is no purpose to any
further appeals and that to prolong this process is to engage in an
exercise in futility,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives argued that the three-judge panel was wrong
to uphold an Immigration and Naturalization Service decision that
Elian should return to Cuba with his father. They said INS
decisions are not necessarily law and can be overturned by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In responses this week, attorneys for the Justice Department and
the boy's father asked the full court to reject the relatives'
appeal and dissolve an injunction keeping him and his son in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day
after his mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank
en route from communist Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The INS decided the boy should be returned to his father. But
the Miami relatives, who cared for Elian after his rescue, refused
to relinquish him. On April 22, federal agents seized the boy and
reunited him with his father in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Official bulletins on Cuba's on state-run television and radio
said decision was ''favorable to Elian and his family,'' adding:
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we have to count on the near-absolute certainty that
the 'mafia' and extreme right in the United States, using the five
days granted them to appeal and maneuver, will not resign
themselves to defeat or end their obsessive plan to obstruct and
delay as much as possible the return of the boy and his family to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quiet Friday afternoon outside the Miami home where Elian
lived with his U.S. relatives before he was taken by federal agents
-- only four demonstrators had gathered outside about an hour after
the decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country is a disgrace,'' said Reinaldo Martinez, a Miami
painter. ''This entire case has been a theater between Clinton and
the Cuban government.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Gay Parade Shows Culture War  </HEADLINE>
By JASMINA KELEMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Celebrating gay pride, thousands of
Israelis in tank tops and shorts danced to deafening music and
waved rainbow-colored flags Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The annual street party has become the latest venue in the
culture war between secular Israelis and devout Jews who consider
homosexuality an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''We promise to support your struggle against the religious,''
legislator Tommy Lapid, leader of the secular rights party Shinui,
told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, gays and lesbians in Israel have scored a
string of successes in the courts, though not in parliament, where
ultra-Orthodox religious parties have considerable clout.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Supreme Court allowed a lesbian spouse to be
registered as the second parent of her partner's biological son. In
1994, same sex unions were recognized for benefit purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The court rulings have coincided with growing public acceptance
of gays. Just a few years ago, public displays of gay pride were
unheard of in Israel. By contrast, gays were hugging and kissing in
Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square in 1998 to celebrate the
transsexual singer Dana International's victory in the Eurovision
Song Contest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the gay pride parade has drawn more and
more people.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rabin Square was lined with Israeli flags and the
rainbow banners of the gay pride movement. Techno music blared from
loudspeakers mounted on trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the parade donned elaborate costumes, while others wore
shorts and T-shirts. Families brought their children, and some
heterosexual couples walked hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   There were no religious protests. Tel Aviv is an overwhelmingly
secular city, and the parade was being held just before the onset
of the Jewish Sabbath, during which observant Jews refrain from
work and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break from the blazing heat, Kinneret Golan said the
scene made her feel that Israel was no different from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''You only see pictures of Israel when rocks are being thrown.
I'm proud that despite everything we can still do this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Golan said that in the increasingly bitter culture war between
Israel's secular majority and the devout minority, the distrust is
so great that ''each side defines itself as the opposite of what
the other is.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, she said, many secular Israelis will support causes
as long as they are denounced by the religious community.
</P>
<P>
   Lapid, standard bearer of the secular fight against what he
calls religious coercion, said his party and the homosexual
movement are natural partners.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, a bill proposing recognition of same-sex civil unions
will be up for approval. However, Lapid said it will likely fail
because of the influence of the religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those dancing in the parade said they paid little heed
to politics. ''Who cares what they do in the Knesset? Look at this
celebration,'' said Anat Schumaker, one of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here and they can't do anything to stop us''

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in Ind. Census Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Criminal recklessness charges were filed
against the owners of a pack of dogs that fatally mauled a census
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Newton and Joann Latvaitis were also charged with
harboring a non-immunized dog and possession of marijuana,
Prosecutor James Oliver said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed there weren't stronger charges available to
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana law subjects animal owners to felony charges for deaths
their animals cause while not properly contained, but not if the
death happens on their property, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Newton and Latvaitis surrendered Friday morning and were freed
on bail, Oliver said. A judge has set a preliminary hearing in the
case for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of 71-year-old Dorothy Stewart was found earlier this
month outside a rural home where she had gone to survey the
occupants. An autopsy determined that she died after being attacked
by as many as 20 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the house where Stewart was attacked had been cited
for failing to restrain dogs three times since 1989, officials
said. Her death led authorities to consider strengthening the
county's animal-control ordinance.

<HEADLINE> Budget bill introduced with spending revised but no budget attached </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A new $21.5 billion budget was technically
introduced Friday, although the full document listing spending
details and changes was not available.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whitman administration officials, Senate and Assembly
staff members all said they are in full agreement on the final
version of the spending plan for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they will get it through the committee system
Monday, through both houses of the Legislature Thursday and on the
governor's desk so she can sign it Friday - barely in time for the
constitutional deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget for the 2000-2001 fiscal year must take effect
next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   According to sections of the bill draft, the budget includes
$63.7 million in small grants lawmakers have inserted for pet
projects or programs in their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call this a ''Christmas Tree'' of pork-barrel spending.
Lawmakers call it cutting through state bureaucracy to save local
property taxes or preserve essential services. No one can question
it has become a Statehouse tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget total reported Friday was $21.481 billion, an
increase of 10 percent in spending from the budget signed one year
ago. Officials on all sides said Thursday the budget was about $50
million larger, so staffs either corrected their math or trimmed
more items before Friday's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly GOP spokesman Chuck Leitgeb said he could not comment
on the change in numbers except to say that negotiations continued
on small controversies late Thursday and early Friday, when
lobbyists could be found heading for closed-door meetings at the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Such last minute spending items include one big surprise: Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco's proposal to extend prescription drug
benefits, at a cost of $50 million, to seniors who earn too much to
qualify for the state's existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other new spending is intended to reverse some of the Whitman
administration's proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Littell, R-Sussex, for instance, was aggravated to
learn that the Department of Environmental Protection was cutting
its $10.4 million budget for park maintenance by $4 million.
Friday's budget draft shows he not only put the $4 million back in,
but added $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the language point, new phrases have been inserted
prohibiting sewer plant operators from playing any role in regional
planning on how best to protect lakes, rivers and their watersheds.
</P>
<P>
   Other language directs the state health department's staff to
examine whether and how the state-run University Hospital in Newark
can be turned over to a private hospital corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone watching and waiting for the budget Friday at the
Statehouse, which amounted to a few dozen lobbyists and a handful
of news reporters, bore witness to a bizarre sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   Were someone to say out loud that it was Friday afternoon and
they wanted the budget, they would have been told Friday was
actually Thursday and then would have been given a budget bill with
no budget attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly and Senate convened Thursday and the members
eventually all went home. But both houses were left in session so
the budget could be introduced whenever staff decided it could do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, it remained Thursday as long as the
legislative session did not adjourn through the night and most of
the day Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, clerks on Friday afternoon filed the budget bill and
gave it a legally required ''first reading,'' despite the fact
there was no actual budget to read, only a title page. Treasury
department spokeswoman Mary Lou Murphy said she could not provide
even a final bottom line to the budget after it had been introduced
- and it was her agency that created the document.
</P>
<P>
   This theater was necessary because the legislative rules say the
budget bill can only be introduced when the Legislature is ''in
session'' and it must be done five business days before a final
vote. The Senate and Assembly are both scheduled to vote Thursday,
and the members did not want to have to come back for an extra,
unscheduled day on the eve of summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Al Porroni, director of the nonpartisan Office of Legislative
Services, said such bending of the rules is common with something
as massive and complex as the annual state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Porroni said the bill is introduced only after the basics are
agreed to, but it takes his staff considerable time to convert
those basics into more than 100 pages of statutory language. He
said every paragraph must be precise since the bill provides the
spine of all state operations and state aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''If mistakes are made in the budget bill, they are not easily
curable,'' Porroni said. ''If we don't get this thing technically
correct, then we are likely to pass something in front of the
Legislature that has errors in it that can cause problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Porroni did acknowledge this year's proceedings were
especially late. Porroni said his staff probably would not have a
complete document available until late Saturday, adding that since
joining OLS in 1972 he had never seen a full budget take so long.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was too much surplus money to haggle over,'' Littell
said. ''They all want a piece.''

Appeals Court Refuses Elian Review
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal appeals court unanimously refused to reconsider the
custody battle over Elian Gonzalez today, paving the way for the boy's possible
return to Cuba next week. The 12-member 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
denied the boy's Miami relatives' request for a rehearing and emphatically said
it would not look at the case again. The court said its earlier stay requiring
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to keep the 6-year-old boy in the United
States will dissolve at 4 p.m. Wednesday.

Judge Denies Vieques Bombing Motion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A federal judge denied a motion today to halt
the U.S. Navy's plans to resume exercises with non-explosive bombs this weekend
on its training ground at Vieques island. Opposition has mounted since news was
published of the Navy's plans to mount its biggest exercise since an April 1999
bombing accident killed a civilian on the range. Five warships would fire up to
600 shells at the range and aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs
-- during two to five days of exercises starting Saturday, according to plans
filed by the Navy.

   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The man who helped the Columbine gunmen buy one of the

4&AMP;frac12; years in prison. Philip Joseph Duran, 23, pleaded guilty in May to
providing a handgun to a juvenile and illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun
during target practice with Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. Duran, who had worked
in a pizza shop with Harris and Klebold, introduced them to gun seller Mark
Manes at a gun show three months before the April 20, 1999, rampage.

a coroner's inquest heard today. All but two perished during the five-hour boat

counts of smuggling and attempting to smuggle the Chinese into Britain.

Democrats Fight GOP Disclosure Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats got some help from unusual quarters -- the
National Right to Life Committee -- as they fight a GOP bill that would require
well-established nonprofit organizations to disclose the names of people who pay
for any political activity. Democrats complain that the Republican bill is too
broad, probably unconstitutional and intended to destroy a legitimate effort to
force newly popular, often secretive political groups to disclose their donors.
The Right to Life group, which lobbies for anti-abortion legislation, is one of
groups that would be affected by the legislation.

<HEADLINE> High school junior aces SAT, ACT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. (AP) - Chris Walsh was only 3 when he
demonstrated his love of - and knack for - math. As a toddler, he
would group items based on color or the letter with which they
began.
</P>
<P>
   The skills he developed then would help him 13 years later when,
as a junior at Niskayuna High School, he achieved perfection on
both the ACT and SAT college entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
   A College Board spokesman in September told the Associated Press
that in the past decade, only three or four students have aced both
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was the only student in New York and one of 29 students
nationwide who took the ACT in April and achieved a perfect score.
Last December, he got a perfect 1600 on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was one of about 4,000 students in New York and 443,000
students nationwide who took the ACT in April.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 students a year nationwide achieve a perfect score,
Kelley Hayden of ACT told The Daily Gazette of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board, which administers the SAT, could not say
Wednesday how many students who took the test this year achieved
the top score of 1600. Of the 1.2 million students who took the
English and math test in 1998-99, 730 achieved a perfect score,
said Dellese Hanley, a program associate for the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh plans to study neuroscience in college.

   Niskayuna is 14 miles northwest of Albany.

<HEADLINE> House speaker says Pataki would make a good running mate for Gov. Bush </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - His crystal ball's a little cloudy, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert said Friday, but Gov. George Pataki could be
a strong running mate for Texas Gov. George Bush's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly a possibility,'' the Illinois Republican said,
''I think it would be a good matchup of certainly the west and the
northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been guarded about White House aspirations, refusing
even to disclose whether he had received a questionnaire sent by
the Texas governor as part of his search for possible vice
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever I do or don't do or might not do or might do with
Governor Bush that's private, will be private,'' Pataki told a
state Capitol news conference last week when told that other
Republicans had gotten such questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Asked again Friday, Pataki ducked the question and abruptly
ended the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the questionnaires surfaced this week when an aide said
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating had received one, filled it out and
sent it back.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp had made it clear it didn't want prospective
running mates talking about the search process, and other
Republicans thought to be on the Bush list likewise remained
closed-mouthed about the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was in Albany to appear at a campaign fund-raiser for
Rep. John Sweeney, a Saratoga Republican up for election in
November.
</P>
<P>
   He also answered questions about the campaign pitting Long
Island Republican Rick Lazio against First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton for the Senate seat being vacated at the end of this year
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio on Friday said he'd cooperate with an ''informal
investigation'' by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a
stock option deal brought into question by the Clinton camp.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Lazio spent about $2,300 in early August 1997
for options on stock of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a brokerage firm. On Sept.
17, 1997, the firm was bought by the Fleet Financial Group. Lazio
sold his stock options that same day for almost $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert called the investigation ''laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton's pretty good in the stock market herself, when
you look at cow futures and whoever she dealt with,'' Hastert said.

<HEADLINE> Stolen, counterfeit check scheme leads to jail term  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A 41-year-old man who worked with others
to steal, alter and cash checks and produce bogus checks on a
computer got 33 months in federal prison Friday, the Department of
Justice announced.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Floyd of Rochester also was ordered to pay back $159,293
in connection with his guilty plea to bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He faced a maximum of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents said from January 1998 to November 1999, Floyd
and others working for him would steal checks and other monetary
instruments from mailboxes in the Rochester area, alter them with a
typewriter then cash them.
</P>
<P>
   He also was using a computer to create his own counterfeit
checks and using them to defraud banks including HSBC, M&AMP;T,
Citibank and Fleet, the justice department said.

<HEADLINE> Negotiator: Israeli Document Untrue  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A senior Palestinian negotiator said Friday
that a document purporting to be a U.S. briefing paper on secret
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The full text of the document, circulating among Israeli
politicians, was published in the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It shows Israel prepared to make unprecedented concessions,
planning to give up parts of Jerusalem and more than 90 percent of
the West Bank, including all of the strategic Jordan Valley, to
exchange some Israeli territory for West Bank land, and to
recognize a limited right of return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The document also anticipates that peace would cost over $100
billion in international aid, to be paid out over 10-20 years. Much
of that money would go to Palestinian refugees. The United States
would be expected to contribute $25 billion, as well as ''not much
less'' than $17 billion for Israeli security needs, to make a total
of about $42 billion, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the architects of
previous interim peace agreements, told diplomats in Israel on
Friday that ''the gaps between the sides are smaller than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia said the gaps remained
wide, and that the purported U.S. document had ''no basis in
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office dismissed the paper as
speculation. And American officials said they'd never seen it until
it was published in the Israeli newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media said the document was being distributed by
hard-line opposition leader Ariel Sharon, and by Natan Sharansky, a
hawkish minister in Barak's cabinet. Neither man could be reached
for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the document originated with the Clinton
administration were a misrepresentation, a U.S. official said,
adding that the document's authors were unknown to the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There were proposals in the document that the Americans had
never even heard of, the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia, meanwhile, said he had been holding behind-the-scenes
talks with his Israeli officials throughout the week, and that
President Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, was to join the
group soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ross arrived in the region Thursday to assess prospects for a
Mideast summit in Washington, during which Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat would try to outline the peace treaty due in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meeting with U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo on
Friday, said more Palestinian flexibility would achieve an
agreement ''that would serve the interests of both sides,''
although ''neither side would achieve its dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians demand the entire Gaza Strip, West Bank, and east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians recently complained that Israel has escalated
tensions by increasing its armed presence in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian security officials have reported an increase in
tanks and combat helicopters. Israeli military chiefs have said
that the increase in security measures stems from May anti-Israel
riots, and does not threaten the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Elian Ruling Looks Favorable  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Friday called the decision by a U.S.
federal appeals court refusing to review the Elian Gonzalez case
''favorable'' but warned that the boy's Miami relatives would
likely continue to try to block his return home.
</P>
<P>
   Brief official bulletins were issued on state-run television and
radio soon after the unanimous decision of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals was released Friday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ''appears to have been favorable to Elian and his
family,'' the statements said.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we have to count on the near-absolute certainty that
the 'mafia' and extreme right in the United States, using the five
days granted them to appeal and maneuver, will not resign
themselves to defeat or end their obsessive plan to obstruct and
delay as much as possible the return of the boy and his family to
Cuba,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And therefore it is our elemental duty to go on with the fight
with more strength and intensity than ever,'' it said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to take another look at the custody battle, the
court set back hopes of Elian's Miami relatives that they would be
able to block his return to the communist island. The court also
said its stay requiring Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to
keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States will dissolve at 4
p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any further requests for stays or for injunctive relief should
be directed to the Supreme Court,'' said the ruling, written by
Circuit Judge J.L. Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine Supreme Court justices must agree to hear an
appeal. A single justice can grant a stay, or can opt to refer the
question of a stay to the full court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came a day before another massive rally is planned
in Cuba to demand Elian's return. An estimated 400,000 people are
expected at a demonstration Saturday in the eastern province of
Holguin, the official Communist Party daily Granma said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast on Nov. 25 after his
mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank en route
from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service decided the boy
should be returned to his father. But the Miami relatives, who
cared for Elian after his rescue, refused to relinquish him. On
April 22, federal agents seized the boy and reunited him with his
father in the Washington area.

<HEADLINE> Key Lockerbie Witness Testfies  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- A key witness in the Lockerbie
bombing trial insisted Friday he was an ordinary Swiss businessman,
despite having already admitted working with the CIA, collaborating
with the former East German secret police and supplying bomb timers
to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics manufacturer Edwin Bollier -- whose company allegedly
made the timer that detonated the bomb on Pan Am flight 103 over
Scotland, killing 270 people in 1988 -- completed a week of
testimony Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Keen spent two hours cross examining
Bollier, and ended by telling the 62-year-old businessman: ''You
are mired completely in a web of deceit, cunning and lying of your
own invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollier denied doing anything illegal or unusual. Deputy
prosecutor Alan Turnbull asked, ''Then, I am to take it that you
are just a legitimate Swiss businessman?''
</P>
<P>
   Bollier responded: ''That is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollier's testimony was critical in the trial of alleged Libyan
agents Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who
are accused of putting the bomb on board the Pan Am plane. The two
men have pleaded innocent to charges of murder and conspiracy to
murder, and have tried to implicate Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
   In five days of testimony, Bollier said his company had designed
and delivered at least 25 timers to the Libyan secret service in
the mid 1980s, testing them in the desert with several high-ranking
Libyan agents.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged discussing explosives with the Libyans, but said
he had not discussed the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Keen sought to discredit Bollier, pointing out inconsistencies
and his failure to remember specifics. He also belittled Bollier as
a collaborator of the former East German secret police, or Stasi,
saying Bollier had made millions of dollars working for his
''masters in East Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollier responded by saying he had come to the Scottish court in
the Netherlands to ''clean up'' the Lockerbie investigation, and
that the lawyer should be grateful his questions were answered at
all.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bollier told the four-judge panel that, just weeks
after the crash, he had written a letter to the CIA implicating
Libya in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier said he wrote the letter under a fictitious name after
he was approached by a ''mysterious secret agent in a macintosh
coat,'' who told him ''the Libyans had done it.'' He didn't
identify the agent or his country.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier said wrote the one-page note because he wanted to put
investigators on the right track. He then began regular fax and
radio communications with the CIA, and even discussed employment
with the agency, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish police investigating the crash found a fragment of one
of the unique MST-13 timers. When asked to look at it in court,
Bollier said it ''looked like one of our MST-13s,'' but that he
could not be sure, Evidence had been tampered with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier admitted earlier to fabricating statements and invoices
to ''protect'' himself and his company, saying: ''I was surveyed by
various secret services, and they have been watching me until
now.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Focuses Attention Back on Gore  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- George W. Bush on Friday said that
Texas' execution of Gary Graham was elevated to a national issue
partly because celebrities seized upon the case to protest the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing wrong with it, by the way,'' Bush said, a day
after the execution that drew protests from Hollywood to
Huntsville, Texas, where it was carried out. ''I don't resent it in
the least. I think it's part of the American process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor tried to change the subject back to Vice
President Al Gore, accusing his Democratic presidential rival of
flip-flopping on whether rising gas prices are good for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems to be changing his tune,'' Bush told reporters during
a campaign stop in Alabama. He noted that Gore, who has loudly
protested the skyrocketing prices, wrote in his book ''Earth in the
Balance'' that higher gas taxes would help protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   He also waded into the renewed controversy over Gore's 1996 fund
raising, saying, ''People are sick and tired of all this stuff''
and should elect him to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The presumed Republican nominee was trying to get back into
campaign mode after a dramatic day and night in which Graham's
appeals were exhausted and the 36-year-old inmate received a lethal
injection as hundreds of people protested outside the Huntsville,
Texas, prison.
</P>
<P>
   He became the 135th inmate executed in Texas since Bush took
office 5&AMP;frac12; years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush waited in his office Thursday night, with a group that
included campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and spokesman Ari Fleischer,
as Graham was pronounced dead at 8:49 p.m. They stayed in the
office about a half-hour more before heading home for bed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, Bush said widespread attention was generated
partly by the efforts of actors, including Danny Glover and Susan
Sarandon, and other well-known death penalty opponents, such as
Amnesty International's Bianca Jagger and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get a movie actor like Mr. Glover who's a well-known
popular figure, Jesse Jackson, others -- they made a case,'' Bush
said aboard his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the governor believed the case
gained prominence ''because of the important questions that people
raised -- all of which the governor believes were fully answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he believes justice was done.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has put more people to death than any other state, and
opponents argue that flaws in its justice system allow innocent
people to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's supporters said he was unfairly convicted of shooting a
man during a robbery, based largely on the testimony of one
eyewitness who didn't know him.
</P>
<P>
   Before reporters could ask about the execution early Friday,
Bush pulled out a copy of Gore's environmental book and read from a
page where Gore calls higher taxes on fossil fuels ''one of the
logical first steps'' toward improving the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recently has condemned the rise in gas prices and supported
a federal investigation into whether oil companies are
price-gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said the vice president's comments
were part of a proposal to encourage clean energy technologies. He
suggested that Bush, a former oilman who has close political ties
with the oil industry in Texas, was launching ''false attacks'' on
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference in Alabama, Bush again answered
questions about whether he showed up for his National Guard duty in
the state in 1972. Bush was given permission to transfer his duties
in the Texas National Guard to Alabama so he could work on the
Senate campaign of Winton ''Red'' Blount. Gore supporters have
questioned whether Bush fulfilled his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was there on a temporary assignment and fulfilled my
weekends at one period of time. I made up some missed weekends,''
Bush said. ''I can't remember what I did, but I wasn't flying
because they didn't have the same airplanes. I fulfilled my
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on Bush's remarks later, campaign spokesman Ari
Fleischer quoted Bush as saying he did ''paper shuffling'' work
while in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to raise $400,000 for his White House bid at the
University of Alabama. He was to raise $1 million more for the
Republican National Committee during an event at the home of Sen.
Richard Shelby, R-Ala.

<HEADLINE> Two Colombia Kidnappings End  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Two kidnappings that outraged Colombia
ended when rightist militias freed a peace envoy's brother and
suspected guerrillas released a 5-year-old girl they had held for
more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Valencia, a state lawmaker and younger brother of
peace negotiator Fabio Valencia, was turned over Friday to the Red
Cross in a rural area of central Antioquia State, and then flown by
helicopter to the state capital, Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   His abduction Monday -- following a deadly shootout in one of
city's upscale neighborhoods -- cast a shadow on peace talks that
began last year to end the 36-year guerrilla conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging the kidnapping, national paramilitary chief
Carlos Castano called it a protest against talks he claims have
yielded nothing but concessions to leftist guerrillas. Castano said
he would only release Valencia after the government gave a public
accounting of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana said Friday no concessions had been
made for Valencia's release.
</P>
<P>
   A tired-looking Guillermo Valencia said he had been treated well
and had talked with his captors for hours about Colombia's
turbulent political situation, which pits two leftist insurgencies,
with an estimated 20,000 fighters, against Colombia's 6,000-strong
militia groups and the country's military.
</P>
<P>
   In another case that infuriated the nation, suspected guerrillas
freed 5-year-old Luisa Cano, seized along with her mother on April
15 from a bus outside Medellin by masked gunmen. Her father paid
ransom for both but only the mother was released two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shedding the fear that keeps many people from reporting their
loved ones' kidnappings, the girl's parents publicized the case,
which highlighted the growing trend of child abductions among the
nearly 3,000 ransom kidnappings reported annually in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm born again,'' shouted Luisa's mother, Luz Cano, as she
hugged her frightened, but apparently unharmed child on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The parents accused Colombia's largest leftist rebel army in the
abduction during an emotional reunion broadcast live on television
at the family's middle-class home. The Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, has denied any role in the kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Film Crew Helicopter Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLIN, British Columbia (AP) -- Four members of a Los Angeles
film crew shooting a car commercial were killed when their
helicopter slammed into a glacier in northwestern Canada,
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was apparently attempting to get a shot of a car
perched on a lower glacier when the private helicopter's rotor
clipped the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred Thursday evening about 35 miles south of
Atlin, which is in the northwest corner of British Columbia, near
the Alaska border.
</P>
<P>
   There were no survivors and the identities of the victims were
not released.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were hampered in their efforts to get to the crash site
when two Labrador helicopters broke down, said Lt. John Coppard of
Canadian Forces Base Comox.
</P>
<P>
   He said rescuers had to be shuttled to the site by an American
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crash site is wedged in a crevasse and we can't even pick
out remains,'' said Capt. Dennis Johnston of Victoria Search and
Rescue. ''It's a very small, a very tight crash site. There was
severe impact and it was consumed by flames thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter that crashed had been contracted out of
Whitehorse by the Vancouver company.

<HEADLINE> Hentrich, Hetherington top final 12 in NFL players tournament.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - Tennessee punter Craig Hentrich and
Carolina fullback Chris Hetherington shot 2-over-par 74s on Friday
to lead 12 players into the final round of the NFL players' portion
of the Cadillac NFL Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee kicker Al Del Greco, the defending champion and
five-time winner, easily qualified for the championship round of
the $30,000 event, where the best final 18-hole score wins.
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco shot a 77 on Friday on the Upper Montclair Country
Club course, the fourth best score among the 26 players who
advanced to the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta quarterback Danny Kanell was third with a 76.
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington and Hentrich each had five bogeys and three birdies
on the tight, tree lined 6,816-yard course.

<HEADLINE> Speaker: Anti-Abortion Divides GOP  </HEADLINE>
By LEN IWANSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- Anti-abortion language in the Republican
Party platform for 2000 will divide the party and alienate many
party members, an abortion-rights supporter told a GOP platform
hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But another speaker, opposing abortion rights, argued that
softening the anti-abortion plank also would ''alienate millions of
pro-life voters'' and erode the base of support of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong session before the Republican platform committee --
the second such regional session this week -- focused mostly on
national defense, community revitalization and Western regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, however, allowed a brief period for remarks by both a
supporter and an opponent of abortion rights. It was the first time
since 1992 that the party has allowed open discussion of the issue
at a platform hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Rosell, a longtime party activist in Montana, urged
the party to drop any mention of abortion in its platform. Rosell,
who served in the state legislature and ran for U.S. Senate in
1964, said if she were running today, she probably wouldn't get the
nomination because of her support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, I wasn't faced with any 'litmus test' back in
those days,'' said Rosell, who spoke on behalf of the Republican
Pro-Choice Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Koutnik, former head of the Christian Coalition chapter
in Montana, said ''the unborn child has a fundamental individual
right to life,'' and that right should be reflected in the GOP
platform. The language calls for a constitutional amendment to
extend protections to the unborn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Polls clearly show that a pro-life position is a winning
position,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion candidates have done well across the country and
it would be foolhardy for Bush to alienate his base of support by
agreeing to soften the platform language or by choosing a running
mate who does not reflect a strong anti-abortion view, Koutnik
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who chairs the GOP platform
committee, has said he doubts the party's uncompromising position
against abortion will be changed when it is debated and approved at
the party's convention July 31-Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Billings hearing was one of two GOP platform hearings held
this week. Another session was held last Monday in Dayton, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Wild Active After Expansion Draft  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Wild general manager Doug
Risebrough didn't wait long to shake up his new roster.
</P>
<P>
   After choosing 26 players in the Friday morning expansion draft
at Calgary, Alberta, the Wild dealt three away.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies Mike Vernon and Chris Terreri along with forward Joe
Juneau were traded in separate deals. This after Risebrough talked
about going against the trend and keeping expansion draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the history of expansion that players are turned over
(before the first season begins),'' he said. ''We didn't go into
this looking for a lot of turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Risebrough sent Vernon to the Calgary Flames for an
eighth-round pick in this weekend's entry draft and Boston
University defenseman Dan Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri was dealt back to New Jersey for defenseman Brad
Bombardir. The Wild also traded center Joe Juneau, drafted from
Ottawa, to Phoenix, for center Rickard Wallin, who played last
season for the Swedish team Troj-Ljungby.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild alternated picks with the NHL's other expansion club
the Columbus Blue Jackets and drafted a mix of veterans, rookies,
minor leaguers and players with overseas experience.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies Jamie McLennan of St. Louis and Zac Bierk of Tampa Bay
were chosen to compete for the starting job with Manny Fernandez,
Dallas' backup goalie who was acquired earlier this month in a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating with Columbus, the Wild took eight defensemen and 14
forwards. Minnesota has 39 players on its roster, including those
signed as free agents and acquired in trades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering the players that were out there, I think we did a
good draft,'' coach Jacques Lemaire said of the Wild, who will
begin play in the upcoming season in the Northwest Division of the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Among the skaters chosen were defenseman Sean O'Donnell, who
played in 80 games for Los Angeles, and left wing Cam Stewart, who
was in 65 games for the Panthers, scoring just 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''This group of players will provide our organization with a
good foundation to build upon,'' Risebrough said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Wild's selections have minimal experience playing
in the United States. Defensemen Artem Anisimov, 23, and defenseman
Oleg Orekhovsky, 22, have spent the last seven seasons skating in
Russia; defenseman Ladislav Benysek, 25, played with Sparta Praha
in the Czech Republic last season; and center Stefan Nilsson, 31,
has played in Sweden the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Bierk split time between the Lightning and a minor league team,
and McLennan appeared in 19 games for the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan is the most experienced of five goalies on the Wild
roster. He has played 138 NHL games and had his best year in
1997-98, when he won 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, McLennan was a member of the team that was the
overall points champion in the league,'' chief amateur scout Tom
Thompson said. ''Bierk is a big-skilled guy and he was certainly a
very good prospect coming out of junior league hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Risebrough selected two Minnesotans, Darby Hendrickson from
Vancouver and Jeff Nielson from Anaheim. The two were linemates in
the early 1990s at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson had nine points in 40 games last season for the
Canucks. Nielson, the captain of the 1993-94 Minnesota team that
reached the NCAA Final Four, scored 18 points in 79 games for the
Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild, who own the third pick in the entry draft, will add
nine players in the selection to be held Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota executives know the team won't be contending for the
Stanley Cup in the early years, but Wild officials said that
building a competitive franchise is crucial for maintaining fan
support.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Panthers had the best expansion season among teams
that entered the NHL since 1991. In 1993-94, the Panthers were
33-34-17. The worst of the seven new entries came in 1992-93, when
the Ottawa Senators were 10-74-4.

<HEADLINE> Defense begins in trial of man accused of arranging ex-wife's murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A federal judge refused Friday to dismiss
charges against a South Texas millionaire accused of arranging his
ex-wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys told U.S. District Judge Ed Prado that eight
days of testimony showed that Blackthorne did not initiate a plot
to kill Sheila Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   Prado ruled there was ''sufficient evidence'' to allow the case
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   In the first day of defense testimony, attorneys for Blackthorne
portrayed him Friday as a loving father concerned about the welfare
of his youngest daughter, Daryl, who was 12 at the time of the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Bindseil, a former lawyer of Blackthorne, testified ''she
(Daryl) was afraid to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne had accused his ex-wife of physically abusing the
girl when his ex-wife and husband lived at Boerne, 35 miles
northwest of San Antonio area.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne was seeking custody of his two daughters with
Bellush, but legally terminated his parental rights on July 22,
1997, after Bellush accused him of sexually abusing the older
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the girls moved to Florida with their mother,
her second husband and the couple's toddler quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   Another former attorney, Ray Perez, testified that Blackthorne
gave up his parental rights because he thought the abuse would stop
if he no longer fought for custody.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, a Texas neighbor of the Bellush family testified
she believed Sheila Bellush was abusing Blackthorne's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Aday said she called police in March 1997 after Daryl
came to her home fearful that she would be beaten. Police sent
Daryl home, but were called again by Aday in late August after
Daryl told the neighbor she had been beaten with a belt.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush was arrested after that incident, but police
later dropped the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough situation for Daryl to be in,'' Aday said. ''I
didn't ever ask her to come over, but I never sent her away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed on Nov. 7, 1997, two months after moving to
Florida. Her 2-year-old quadruplets were unharmed. Two of them were
crawling in their mother's blood when the murder was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Blackthorne asked a golfing buddy,
Daniel Rocha, to find a hit man to bludgeon Bellush. Rocha
testified he contacted his friend, Sammy Gonzales, who hired his
cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro, the alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The defense indicated to the judge on Friday that it would be
finished with its case next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Bellush, second husband of the slain woman, now lives in
Sussex County, N.J. He filed a $32 million wrongful death lawsuit
last August, naming Blackthorne, Rocha, Gonzales and Del Toro as
defendants.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling Open to Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- With the trade deadline a little more than a
month away, Curt Schilling is once again considering the
possibility of leaving the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old, three-time All-Star met Thursday in New York
with Phillies general manager Ed Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the possibility exists that I can go to one of the teams
that I gave him, I told him that I would waive my no-trade to go to
certain places,'' Schilling said, although he declined to identify
any of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Wade, who has been trying to trade starter Andy Ashby, appears
to be in no hurry to move Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him that our goal was to keep him, and I want him to be
a part of our situation here,'' Wade said. ''He indicated to me, as
he had publicly, that he wouldn't be opposed to at least our
exploring the possibility of doing something. I made no commitment
in that regard, so I don't view it as any kind of new news.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, whose only postseason appearance was with the
Phillies 1993 NL championship team, is 2-4 with a 5.43 this season
as he comes back from offseason shoulder surgery, his second
operation in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think we're in a situation where it might be better off
here if I did go somewhere else,'' Schilling said. ''I've been here
nine years and eight of them we've lost. I don't know that I'm the
guy that's going to make the difference here.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, whose current contract runs through the 2001 season,
wants to pitch for a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to win,'' Schilling said. ''If the situation presents
itself, I want to be on a team that's going to compete this year
and next year also, like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Schilling was nearly dealt in 1997 before deciding to
remain with the team, the list he has provided Wade might make a
move easier to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I have some more latitude, if I do indeed want to
explore it,'' Wade said. ''But it's not something that I ran to the
phone and started going through my confidential phone directory
last night or today. It's just the product of being in New York in
June.''

<HEADLINE> Police, school board investigate paddling claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - Police are investigating the report that
five freshman students were paddled to the point of bruising as
part of a hazing tradition at the local high school.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the allegations, some school board members say
they want to create an anti-hazing policy for the district.
</P>
<P>
   Students and parents say such hazing is a long tradition at the
Elmira Free Academy and may also be occurring at other schools
among even younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Elmira school board member Thomas Kump told the Elmira Star
Gazette he believes a hazing policy is necessary, and that the
punishment for hazing should be expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we don't have a legal obligation, we have a moral
obligation to school-age children from the time they leave home to
the time they return,'' said Kump.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's a big enough deal to worry about,'' said
Alexis Blackman, EFA's nonvoting student representative to the
board. Blackman, who will be a senior in the fall, had not heard of
the paddling tradition until this week.

that sank in the North Atlantic during a devastating 1991 storm,
taking four fishermen with it.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was recounted in Sebastian Junger's best-selling book.
The Warner Bros. movie of ''The Perfect Storm'' premieres June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's as close to the Andrea Gail as you can get,'' said Doug
Merrifield, the film's marine coordinator, who helped bring
Junger's book to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't hard to transform the Maryland boat into her
Massachusetts counterpart - the two boats came from the same Panama
City, Fla., shipyard 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The owners sailed Lady Grace to California in 1999 for filming,
then up to Massachusetts for more filming.
</P>
<P>
   Locals in Gloucester were rattled by the sight of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like the ghost of the real one coming back,'' one
fisherman told the Mail of London. ''A lot of people got very
tearful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lady Grace was actually the director's second pick, but the
owner of the larger Lindsey L, in Barnegat Light, N.J., didn't want
to sell her.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Grace owners Mike McCook and Larry Keen did.
</P>
<P>
   And while actor George Clooney skippers Andrea Gail in the
movie, the real captain on-screen and off is Stanley ''Sonny''
Layton, 41, who also calls Ocean City home port.
</P>
<P>
   Since the filmmakers bought Lady Grace in March 1999, she has
sailed more than 18,000 miles, passing twice through the Panama
Canal. She's now on her way to Germany and England for the European
premiere of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Once the promotions end, Lady Grace will end up - where else? -
on eBay, the online auction service, which has begun advertising an
auction that begins June 28.

Cuba: Elian Ruling Looks Favorable
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba today called the decision by a U.S. federal appeals court
not to review the Elian Gonzalez case ''favorable,'' but warned that the
6-year-old refugee's Miami relatives would likely continue to try to block his
return home. Brief official bulletins were issued on state-run television and
radio soon after the unanimous decision of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta. In Miami, the relatives said they will file an appeal with
the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday.

Negotiator: Israeli Document Untrue
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A senior Palestinian negotiator said Friday that a document
purporting to be a U.S. briefing paper on secret Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations is untrue. The full text of the document, circulating among Israeli
politicians, was published in the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper. It shows
Israel prepared to make unprecedented concessions, planning to give up parts of
Jerusalem and more than 90 percent of the West Bank, including all of the
strategic Jordan Valley, to exchange some Israeli territory for West Bank land,
and to recognize a limited right of return of Palestinian refugees.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told investigators that he does not

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A federal judge denied a motion today to halt

on its training ground at Vieques island. Opposition has mounted since news was
published of the Navy's plans to mount its biggest exercise since an April 1999
bombing accident killed a civilian on the range. Five warships would fire up to
600 shells at the range and aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs

providing a handgun to a juvenile and illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun

<HEADLINE> Sacramento 84, Washington 69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tangela Smith scored 22 points and Yolanda
Griffith added 21 as the Sacramento Monarchs beat the Washington
Mystics 84-69 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ticha Penicheiro had a season-high 12 assists with no turnovers
for Sacramento (7-4), which remained unbeaten in five meetings with
the Mystics. After losing three of their first four games, the
Monarchs have won six of their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki McCray scored 19 points for Washington, which lost
back-to-back games for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had no answer for Griffith and Smith, the Monarchs'
6-foot-4 forwards who combined to shoot 18-of-25 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not miss a shot until less than 14 minutes remained.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento broke it open late in the first half when the
Monarchs held Washington scoreless for 4:33. Katy Steding hit a
pair of 3-pointers during Sacramento's 12-0 run that put the
Monarchs ahead 32-27 with 3:33 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Washington cut Sacramento's lead to 53-51 when the Mystics went
on a 12-3 run with 13 minutes remaining. But the Monarchs quickly
built their lead to 63-54, and never led by less than nine points
the remainder of the game.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy? What bankruptcy? Sands draws curtain on big renovation  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo XACP101
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - The Sands Hotel &AMP; Casino unveiled the
results of a $18 million renovation project Friday, going ahead
with a ribbon-cutting ceremony regardless of a bitter fight being
waged over the building's future in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Sands, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January
1998, is currently the target in a battle between billionaire
financier Carl Icahn and casino giant Park Place Entertainment
Corp., both of which have submitted bids to pull the casino out of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Judith Wizmur authorized the
renovation, which Sands officials called an investment in the
property's future.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of it is a dramatic new entryway off Pacific
Avenue that consists of 18 multicolored, three-sided obelisks,
which stand 40 feet tall. A giant ''Sands'' banner spans Pacific
Avenue, suspended from obelisks on either side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   An expensive Chinese restaurant inside was replaced with the
moderately-priced Bokoo Grille; the food court was redesigned and
named the Food Factory. New casino decor also was installed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's opening ceremonies were delayed more than 30
minutes by the late arrival of King Mswati of the South African
country of Swaziland. Sands spokeswoman Daniele Vargas said the
king is interested in seeing how casinos operate here and will tour
several of them this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the dramatic renovations and construction, the summer of
2000 marks a new beginning for the Sands and its employees. To say
the least, we're excited to have the public see us redefined and
new,'' said Sands CEO Alfred Luciani.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmation hearings, which are being held in Camden,
resume Tuesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lazio proclaims innocence; says he'll cooperate with SEC probe  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Rick Lazio said Friday
he'll cooperate with an ''informal investigation'' by the
Securities and Exchange Commission into his stock option trading
and confidently declared he's done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to the Association for a Better New York at the
Waldorf-Astoria, the Long Island Republican described himself as
''an average middle-class guy'' who is ''fully comfortable with
everything I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who supports Lazio's Democratic
opponent in the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, wrote to SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. asking for an investigation of Lazio's
stock option trading. McCall called for the probe after it came out
that Lazio scored a nearly 600 percent profit trading on options
for stock in a company headed by political supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Lazio spent about $2,300 in early August 1997
for options on stock of Quick &AMP; Reilly, a brokerage firm. On Sept.
17, 1997, the firm was bought by the Fleet Financial Group. Lazio
sold his stock options that same day for almost $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, former senior executives
of Quick &AMP; Reilly, who along with other company executives have
donated at least $35,000 to Lazio's campaigns since 1995, said they
had never discussed the company's stock with Lazio. Lazio also
denied any insider knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is I am an average middle-class guy; I have
returns of between five and 10 percent,'' Lazio told a mob of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he discussed the controversy with his wife, Pat, on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'You know what, we're honest, decent people. I clean
my own house. We work hard. We have nothing to be ashamed of.
They're trying to drag you down in the mud, don't let them do it.'
And I'm not going to let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was also asked about the timing of the SEC probe. It was
disclosed on the same day that independent counsel Robert Ray said
he had found substantial evidence of involvement on the part of the
first lady in the White House travel office firings, but
insufficient evidence to indict her on perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's fairly transparent,'' he said. ''I think the
Clinton camp has got to answer for itself. And I think the people
of New York are going to judge her behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col said: ''The
Clinton administration has a long history of abusing federal
authority and using government bureaucracies to attack their
political opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson fired back:
''Desperate candidates make desperate charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a Lazio supporter, commented in Albany on
Friday about the SEC probe. ''It's kind of strange,'' he said. ''I
don't believe they did a very detailed analysis, or any
investigation at all when Mrs. Clinton made $100,000 in one day on
pork bellies, and yet they do investigate a stock transaction by
her opponent. You can draw your own conclusion from that as to my
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned a $1,000 investment in the cattle futures market
into nearly $100,000 during a nine-month period in 1978 and 1979,
when her husband was attorney general and then governor of
Arkansas. She denied any wrongdoing in those transactions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, on a swing through Albany
Friday, called the SEC inquiry a ''laughable type of
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known Rick Lazio for a pretty long time. He's a pretty
honorable person,'' Hastert said. ''This administration would stop
at nothing to carry out a vendetta against somebody who happens to
be running against them or doesn't agree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was headed back to Washington after the appearance in
Manhattan Friday. But he missed a vote in the morning in which the
GOP-led House approved giving the Justice Department funds to
pursue a federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry. The measure
passed 215-183.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Clinton campaign released a television ad
upstate that criticizes Lazio for missing a vote last week to
create a 2 million barrel home heating oil reserve. The initiative
failed by two votes. Lazio skipped the vote to return to New York
to campaign for the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Congo: War Mediator Office Reopened  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Reversing a decision that threatened to
undermine efforts to end Congo's civil war, the Congolese
government said Friday it had reopened the office of the mediator
charged with bringing the country's warring factions together.
</P>
<P>
   But the government remains opposed to former Botswana president
Ketumile Masire, who was chosen in December by the warring parties
to lead national talks aimed at establishing a broad-based
government in Congo, the country's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have discovered that he's been partial and we want someone
impartial,'' Kongolo said in a telephone interview from the
Congolese capital, Kinshasa. ''We are still committed to the
inter-Congolese dialogue with an impartial facilitator.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed police on Wednesday sealed Masire's office in Kinshasa,
sparking protests from the Organization of African Unity and the
U.N. Security Council, which called for it to be reopened
immediately. The council on Thursday deplored the failure of
President Laurent Kabila's government to cooperate in ending the
war, which now involves at least five neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Kongolo attributed the closing of the office to a
''misunderstanding'' among low-level police.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police understood it as an end of the whole role of the
facilitator, so they went and closed the whole office. This was
done at a low level of the police. When the government was
informed, the president himself instructed the Ministry of Interior
to reopen it,'' he said, confirming that the office had been
reopened Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The justice minister said the office staff was welcome to return
-- but not Masire.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has written to Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of
the Organization of African Unity, asking for the OAU to ''come and
work with us to pick somebody else to come and occupy the office,''
Kongolo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese government has accused Masire of bias and
repeatedly blocked his work. Earlier this month, the government
refused to attend preliminary talks organized by Masire and
prevented opposition politicians from attending.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement signed last summer in Lusaka, Zambia,
by Kabila and his rebel foes, a neutral facilitator was to organize
talks among the warring factions which would set a timetable for
elections, determine what kind of government Congo would have, and
who would be its president.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council on Thursday asked its current president,
France's U.N. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte, to examine the
situation with Kabila, Salim and the current OAU chairman, Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
   Levitte spoke to Kabila Friday morning, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of replacing the facilitator remains problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, a Security
Council member, noted Thursday that it took months to reach
agreement on Masire.

<HEADLINE> Impasse declared, union says strike appears imminent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - With a strike deadline barely one day off, the
union representing 10,000 utility workers in New York City and
Westchester County declared contract talks at an impasse Friday and
sought the help of a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Consolidated Edison and three other companies that
provide power to 3.3 million metropolitan area customers promised
they would walk off the job if the utility insisted on what they
termed ''union givebacks'' on sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   The workers are scheduled to strike at 12:01 a.m. Sunday if
there is no agreement. The union represents 9,000 Con Ed workers
and 1,000 employees at the other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Con Edison's irrational position on this issue, I have no
doubt that we are on the verge of a strike,'' said Manny Hellen,
president of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America - Con Ed's
largest labor union.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were ''miles apart'' on job security, pension and
medical benefits issues, Hellen added.
</P>
<P>
   The utility, in a statement issued Friday afternoon, did not
discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a critical stage of our negotiations,'' the utility
said. ''In the event of a strike, Con Edison will assign qualified
and experienced managers to ... maintain the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The company assured its customers that there would be no change
in service.
</P>
<P>
   A bargaining session with a mediator was scheduled for Friday
afternoon, according to Hellen.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, a spokeswoman for Con Ed said talks were
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The union head reported some progress in negotiations with two
other employers, Orion Power and NRG Energy. A fourth utility,
Keyspan Energy, was expected back at the bargaining table Friday
after talks broke off twice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County Executive Andy Spano, whose consituents
include 330,000 Con Ed customers, said he was in contact with Con
Ed about the potential strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are at a critical period in their negotiations,'' he
said. ''Hopefully, a strike can be averted.''

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Columbine Guns  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The man who helped the Columbine gunmen buy
one of the weapons they used to kill 12 students and a teacher was
sentenced Friday to 4&AMP;frac12; years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Joseph Duran, 23, pleaded guilty in May to providing a
handgun to a juvenile and illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun
during target practice with Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are going to be serving a sentence to show the world the
harm that can be caused,'' District Court Judge Thomas Woodford
told Duran.
</P>
<P>
   Duran, who had worked in a pizza shop with Harris and Klebold,
introduced them to gun seller Mark Manes at a gun show three months
before the April 20, 1999, rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Manes sold Klebold and Harris a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic handgun.
They used it and other weapons to kill 13 people and wound 23
others at Columbine High School before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Manes was sentenced in November to a six-year prison term for
providing the handgun to minors.
</P>
<P>
   In a video found after the massacre, Harris and Klebold thanked
Duran and Manes for helping them get weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Duran could have received up to nine years in prison. District
Attorney Dave Thomas said he was pleased with the sentence because
most people facing the same charges get probation. He said Duran
could be eligible for release in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney George Brauchler said Duran should
have been concerned after hearing Harris and Klebold talk about how
much damage the guns could do to humans while at the firing range.
</P>
<P>
   Duran's lawyer described Harris and Klebold as depraved teens
bent on killing. Matt DePetro said Duran knew the two only through
work, and the gunmen's friends were in a better position to know
what they were planning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it only contributes to our hurt that there is nothing
any one of us could have done,'' DePetro said.
</P>
<P>
   Duran's case was the last active criminal prosecution in the
Columbine shootings.

<HEADLINE> More Texas Inmates Await Execution  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush, who faced a loud
outcry over this week's execution of Gary Graham, is likely to be
confronted with more death penalty questions as his presidential
campaign wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the Nov. 7 election, a dozen Texas inmates are
scheduled to die.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to continue to follow (Bush),'' said Jim
Marcus of the Texas Defenders Service, a private nonprofit group
that represents death row imates. ''The problem is he's expressed
confidence in a system that's really not worthy of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's next execution, the 24th of the year in Texas, is
set for Thursday when Jessy San Miguel is scheduled to die for a
1991 murder.
</P>
<P>
   At least four more executions are set for July, six in August,
and three more in the weeks leading up to the election.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely there will be others since Texas trial court judges,
who set execution dates, may do so with only 30-day notice to the
condemned inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Another case with Texas connections could throw the death
penalty spotlight on President Clinton and Bush's likely Democratic
opponent in November, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, an accused Texas marijuana
smuggler, is set to be executed Aug. 5 in Terre Haute, Ind., and
become the first federal prisoner put to death since a convicted
murderer and kidnapper was hanged in Iowa in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to be linked to the campaign,'' Marcus
said. ''It's going to highlight the fact the federal death penalty
is kicking into gear and the next president is going to have to
probably deal with several of these.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure both Bush and Gore are going to have to make
comments. Of course, Bush will have no problem saying: 'I know how
to do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spate of upcoming executions in Texas, none appears
to be as controversial as that of Graham, who was put to death
Thursday after a series of unsuccessful appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't going to be another case like Graham,'' David Dow,
a University of Houston Law Center professor who also handles
appeals for some death row inmates, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are other cases on the horizon but nothing I think that
will come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Graham pleaded guilty to 10 aggravated robberies during
a weeklong 22-crime rampage in May 1981, he insisted he was not
responsible for the shooting death of Bobby Lambert, 53, of Tucson,
Ariz. Graham and his supporters said he was convicted on shaky
evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a
poor job.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war is not over,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who witnessed
Graham's death, said Friday while visiting Graham's grieving
relatives in Houston. ''He lost that battle but the war is not
over, the war to stop the killing, the war to stop killing people
based upon race profiles, inadequate lawyers, mistaken identities
and wrongful convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-death penalty sentiment is not new in Texas, which
leads the nation in carrying out executions. Graham was No. 222
since 1982. The death row population, 460, is second only to
California, where executions are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, demonstrators and media in larger numbers than
Thursday converged on the Texas death house as Bush, running for
election, signed off on the execution of convicted pickax killer
Karla Faye Tucker. Bush, allowing the execution of a woman in Texas
for the first time since the Civil War era, would be haunted by the
action, death penalty opponents said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Tucker's death was not an issue as Bush won
re-election by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really what was involved in that case was it was the first
woman,'' Dow said. ''It's hard for that to sustain a debate. This
case (Graham) is a little different but I still think it will go
away because the American public is not really ready to start
debating the issue.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Doctor Guilty in Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. (AP) -- A plastic surgeon was found guilty Friday of
manslaughter in the shooting death of his estranged wife's lover.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court jury convicted Dr. James Kartell, 61, in the
February, 1999, slaying of Janos Vajda, 57. The shooting came after
the two men struggled in a hospital room where both men were
visiting Kartell's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father is gone. He has died,'' said Vajda's daughter
Bernadett. ''My family is glad that justice has been served.''
</P>
<P>
   Kartell faced a murder charge, but the jury convicted him of the
lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kartell, who had claimed he shot in self-defense, showed no
emotion as the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer said he was prepared to accept whatever verdict was
handed down. ''It is extraordinarily difficult for a person who has
never seen a jail cell to try and cope,'' J.W. Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Fred B. McAlary said he was pleased with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think justice was done,'' he said. ''He was convicted of an
unlawful crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Kartell will remain in prison until sentencing on July 19.

<HEADLINE> City officials says recycling coming back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMSTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) - An alderman said he has enough votes to
bring back recycling after a six-month hiatus that forced the state
to sue the city.
</P>
<P>
   Alderman Joseph Emanuele, along with Vincenzo ''Jim'' Nicosia
and William Wills have called for a special Common Council meeting
Monday at which, Emanuele said, the three will support a plan to
return recycling to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The council earlier this month tabled a resolution which would
have authorized a $169,980 contract to haul the city's recyclables.
The city suspended recycling at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The city had terminated its contract with its old waste hauler
after receiving complaints that recyclables were being commingled
with non-recyclables and dumped in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed a lawsuit against the
city and Common Council June 8 after the council tabled the
resolution to award Spohn Disposal a one-year recycling contract.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuele said he will ask the council to take $70,000 of the
$80,000 intended for a fall cleanup program to pay for curbside
recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer spokesman Paul Larabee told the newspaper he couldn't
say if the council vote would end the state's legal proceeding.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jackets Considering Lever  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres assistant coach Don Lever is
being considered for the head coaching position with the expansion
Columbus Blue Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Lever, who just completed his 10th season as a Sabres assistant,
interviewed with Blue Jackets president and general manager Doug
MacLean earlier this week. MacLean said he plans to select a coach
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier confirmed Friday that he
gave the Blue Jackets permission to speak to Lever.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that when you have people who have an
opportunity to move up, and the timing is right, I think it's
something every organization should and in most cases does
promote,'' Regier said.
</P>
<P>
   Lever, 48, worked under the title of Sabres associate coach for
the past four seasons. He is under contract with Buffalo, meaning
the Blue Jackets would have to compensate the Sabres if Lever was
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Lever also spent two seasons as head coach of the Sabres minor
league farm club, the Rochester Americans. In the 1990-91 season,
he was chosen as the American Hockey League's coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Lever would leave the Sabres with two holes to fill after
Mike Ramsay retired in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jackets have a number of coaching candidates being
considered, including former Edmonton Oilers coach Ron Low and
Colorado assistant Bryan Trottier.
</P>
<P>
   Several publications have reported that Columbus also
interviewed Detroit associate coach Dave Lewis, Los Angeles
assistant Dave Tippett, former Calgary head coach Dave King,
Philadelphia Flyers Hall of Famer and minor-league coach Bill
Barber and ex-San Jose assistant Paul Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   The fellow-expansion Minnesota Wild already have their head
coach in place, hiring Jacques Lemaire earlier this month.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Lisa Leslie had 17 points, 13 rebounds and three
blocked shots in the Los Angeles Sparks' 68-54 victory over the
Miami Sol on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie shot 7-of-13 and Mwadi Mabika added 10 points for the
Sparks (8-2), who shot 50 percent from the field (24-of-48) while
limiting Miami to 27 percent (17-of-63) shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Sam scored 19 points for Miami (4-7), but no other starter
scored more than three points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks led 35-30 at halftime, but went on a 15-5 run to open
the second period. The game was never in doubt from that point as
Los Angeles (8-2) opened up a lead that grew to as many as 18.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took a 9-2 lead behind Leslie's outside shooting,
but the first half had five lead changed and four ties.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were coming in on highs. Leslie had a season-high 21
points and a career-high 14 rebounds in a 90-84 Los Angeles upset
over the Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol were coming off a last-second 57-55 victory over the
Washington Mystics, and attempting to win their third straight game
at AmericanAirlines Arena.

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead In Guatemala Prison Riot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Police officers stormed a Guatemala City
prison in a pre-dawn search for drugs Friday, touching off a riot
that killed two people and left 11 officers and 20 prisoners
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Officers entering the grounds of the Pavon rehabilitation work
farm, located about 18 miles southeast of Guatemala City, were met
by prisoners who overpowered a small group of guards and hurled
rocks and broken glass shards, said Antonio Conte Cojulun, general
director of Guatemala's national penal system.
</P>
<P>
   It took police officers more than an hour to regain control of
the area early Friday. Cojulun said one police officer was severely
beaten and cut with a machete during the violent clash. He died
late Friday morning after being rushed to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner injured in the clash also died at a hospital late
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The other 11 officers hurt during the disturbance were being
treated, mostly for minor injuries they received when they were hit
by debris, Cojulun said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, volunteer firefighters returning from the scene
reported that more than a dozen prisoners hurt in the riot were
waiting to be transported to the hospital while authorities worked
out security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very concerned with the human rights of our inmates,
but we are also concerned about maintaining order,'' Cojulun said.
</P>
<P>
   Cojulun said prison authorities asked a special unit from
Guatemala's national police force to storm the prison after they
received reports that prisoners inside had used intimidation and
bribes to take control of the minimally guarded facility and use it
to ''run drugs into the city.''
</P>
<P>
   After the disturbance, police officers found dozens of knives,
machetes and homemade explosives as well as 30 cell phones, three
computers and countless bottles of liquor and beer in the
prisoners' cells, Vice Minister Jose Antonio Monroy said.

<HEADLINE> LA Dedicates Last Segment of Subway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The last planned segment of the city's $4.5
billion subway was dedicated Friday in a ceremony at the new San
Fernando Valley station.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cheered the completion of the final 6.3-mile segment
that connects North Hollywood in the valley to the rest of the
Metro Rail Red Line already operating on the south side of the
Santa Monica Mountains between Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very hopeful that even though we have concluded what's on
the drawing boards now that we will use the momentum of this
project coming in ahead of schedule and on budget to really move
forward with the broader vision,'' said Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   The last leg came in on time, but the overall 17.4-mile system
was marked by cost overruns, delays, political fighting, scandals
and ultimately a vote by Los Angeles County residents in 1998 to
ban further use of tax money for subways.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years in the making, the subway is six miles shorter
than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The final 6.3-mile segment open to the public Saturday. Weekend
rides on the entire Red Line were to be free, but the real test of
the usefulness of the system is expected during regular weekday
commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Commutes between the valley and the Los Angeles basin are marked
by frustrating freeway congestion as motorists squeeze through two
passes or around the eastern end of the mountains. The new subway
segment cuts directly underneath the mountains.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 6, Cubs 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mike Lowell's two-run home run highlighted a
four-run fifth inning as the Florida Marlins defeated the Chicago
Cubs 6-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo had four singles in five at-bats for Florida,
improving his average to .365. He also scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny (4-6) allowed one run in six innings for his first
victory since April 23, and Ricky Bones pitched the final two
innings for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell's home run, his 10th of the season, gave the Marlins a
5-0 lead when his shot off loser John Lieber (5-5) cleared the
left-center field wall and scored Cliff Floyd ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd had reached on a single to right, which drove in Castillo
with the Marlins' first run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's single also advanced Mark Kotsay, who had reached on a
walk, to third and Kotsay then scored on Preston Wilson's sacrifice
fly, giving Florida a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford's homer in the sixth, his 11th of the season, was
the lone run for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida added a run in the bottom of the sixth when Floyd's
groundout scored pinch hitter Kevin Millar, who had singled and
moved to third on singles by Castillo and Kotsay.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored in the first when Castillo singled and came
home on Kotsay's double down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa had a chance to help the Cubs in the first but he
grounded into a double play after Eric Young walked and Ricky
Gutierrez singled.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RHP Chuck Smith, 30, will make his third major league start
Saturday. Smith is the Marlins' second pitcher in his 30s to make
his major league debut this season, joining reliever Joe Strong,
37. ... With his first-inning double, Kotsay now has hit safely in
10 of his last 12 starts. ... SS Ricky Gutierrez, who played at
Miami's American High, was recalled from an injury assignment in
Class A Daytona Beach and activated prior to Friday's game. To make
room for Gutierrez, the Cubs optioned SS Augie Ojeda to Triple-A
Iowa. ... Buford's home run in the sixth gave him a career-best 11.

<HEADLINE> A's Chavez Agrees to Extension  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Less than 48 hours after becoming the
first Athletics player to hit for the cycle at the Oakland
Coliseum, Eric Chavez agreed Friday to a $11.75 million, four-year
contract extension through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, hitting .288 with 12 homers and 39 RBIs entering Friday
night's game against Kansas City, became the ninth Oakland player
to sign a contract running through at least the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very nice pat on the back for me,'' Chavez said. ''It
keeps us together and I think we're just going to get better and
better as time goes on. It's like they found a core of guys and
decided to go with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's began the day leading the AL West by 1&AMP;frac12; games over
Seattle and had the third-best record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a left-handed batter who hit .247 as a rookie last
season, struggled so much against left-handers early this season
that he appeared likely to wind up in a platoon with Olmedo Saenz
for a second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1996 first-round draft choice battled out of his batting
slump and has become the club's everyday third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Friday's game, Chavez had hit safely in 17 of his
last 18 games and was batting .397 over that span. On Wednesday
against Baltimore, he became the third player in Oakland history to
hit for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 22, was the eighth-youngest player in major league
history to hit for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great news to have him in the fold,'' A's manager Art
Howe said. ''It's another kid that we've now got locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's have eight other players with contracts beyond this
season -- including shortstop Miguel Tejada and right fielder Ben
Grieve, both of whom signed four-year extensions through 2003 this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he was surprised when negotiations on the contract
extension resumed recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought they would come through this soon,'' he said.
''I thought they would be waiting until the end of the season and
then try to do something.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Astacio's Trial Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Pedro Astacio's domestic violence trial reportedly
has been delayed, ensuring the Colorado Rockies right-hander will
not be deported in the midst of the team's surprising season.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, who is 6-4 with a 4.63 ERA in 15 starts, faced possible
deportation to the Dominican Republic if convicted at trial July 5.
The trial has been delayed until November, KCNC-TV in Denver
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies officials with the team in Phoenix said they were
unaware of a new court date.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, 30, initially pleaded guilty to third-degree assault
but was allowed to withdraw the plea after immigration officials
began deportation proceedings. His original trial date would have
fallen in the middle of a 10-day road trip leading up to the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio was arrested Aug. 12, one day after his estranged wife
told Greenwood Village police that he hit her in the right eye
during an argument at the home the couple shared until their
separation last June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Police reports said Ana Astacio had swelling and a red mark on
her face. Astacio later admitted being at the house, but denied he
hit Ana.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired by Colorado in a 1997 trade with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, Astacio signed a four-year contract extension in 1998
worth $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander went 17-11 with a 5.04 ERA last season and
finished third in the NL with 210 strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> United States 11, Trinidad 0  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- April Heinrichs sure wasn't kidding when she
said the U.S. women would show no mercy in the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounted to little more than a stroll through
Hersheypark on Friday night, the world champions routed overmatched
Trinidad and Tobago 11-0 as Cindy Parlow scored three goals. The
Americans' coach promised her team would not back down, and it was
relentless in the opener of the eight-nation tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the younger, less-heralded World Cuppers were dominant
early in the one-sided game in which the Americans possessed the
ball 90 percent of the time. Lorrie Fair, who has stepped in for
injured Michelle Akers at center midfield, scored twice in a
minute. Christie Pearce, in for captain Carla Overbeck at outside
halfback, had two beautiful assists in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors never had a chance. Were it not for some
spectacular saves by Nicole Mitchell, the United States might have
reached two dozen goals. And after Mitchell banged her knee in a
collision with Mia Hamm late in the first half, the Americans
seemed capable of it.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't have bothered Heinrichs, who said the faucet would
remain turned on regardless of the score. Heinrichs saw her team's
sharp passing and overwhelming ball possession pay off with goals
from veterans such as Hamm and Tiffeny Milbrett, and developing
stars such as Fair and Parlow, who had a hat trick for the third
time this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, who missed a half-dozen wonderful chances in the first
half, drilled home a short shot off a scramble in the 48th minute.
She got another in the 68th.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon MacMillan put a penalty shot over the crossbar moments
after Hamm's first score, but that didn't stem the onslaught.
Parlow got her second of the night with a header off a precise
corner kick by Milbrett in the 51st.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm then made a perfect feed to MacMillan for a short tap-in in
the 62nd. Eleven minutes later, Parlow headed in a long cross from
Brandi Chastain to make it 9-0. It was her fourth three-goal game
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Whalen converted for the 10th goal off MacMillan's long
through pass and got the final goal on a breakaway in the 90th.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 10,483, many carrying American flags or dressed in
No. 9 Hamm jerseys, first began cheering the U.S. women when they
entered the stadium runway midway through the opening game between
Brazil and Costa Rica. The cheers were louder when the team came
out for warmups to ''All-Star,'' blaring over the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest ovation came when Parlow, who had seven goals in
the recent Australia Cup, sent home a loose ball in the fourth
minute. From there, it was a smooth run for the United States,
which meets Costa Rica on Sunday in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Brazil had an equally easy time with Costa Rica as
Roseli and Formiga scored two goals each in an 8-0 romp.

General Janet Reno had warned that without the extra funds, she would have to
drop the legal action -- which could net billions of dollars -- because her
department could not have afforded it.

<HEADLINE> Taped Reno Deposition at Waco Trial  </HEADLINE>
By MATT SLAGLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- During the final day of the Branch Davidian
standoff, federal agents had the discretion to do what needed to be
done to insert tear gas to flush sect members out of the compound,
Attorney General Janet Reno said in a videotaped deposition played
for jurors Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the discretion would have to be exercised within the
limits of the plan,'' Reno said of the FBI commanders at the Mount
Carmel site near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The Reno-approved plan called for FBI agents to use tank booms
to gradually insert tear gas in the building. If after 48 hours the
tear-gassing plan was ineffective, then agents could begin the
systematic dismantling of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's testimony was played during the $675 million wrongful
death lawsuit brought by surviving Davidians and family members who
claim the government is responsible for the deaths of some 80
people who died April 19, 1993, some from fire, others from
gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff's attorney Michael Caddell contends that federal
agents violated the approved plan when they prematurely began
tearing down a part of the building known as the gymnasium while
agents in tanks launched tear gas into the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Steve McGavin, an FBI supervisory agent who
helped draft a proposal to remove the Davidians, told jurors that
firefighting equipment was not on the ''inner perimeter.'' ''There
was no plan to bring in firefighting equipment until we could
secure the building and secure the safety of firefighters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell later showed videotaped testimony of four former
high-ranking FBI officials who said they believed Reno's
instructions for on-site emergency crews included firefighting
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came from former FBI director Williams Sessions,
former deputy director Floyd Clarke, retired deputy assistant FBI
director Danny Coulson and former FBI Assistant Director Larry
Potts.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she didn't dictate details of the plan, such as where
the tanks were or how tear gas would be inserted into the building.
She told investigators in the Justice Department's 1993 review of
the Waco tragedy that senior FBI leaders told her to ''butt out''
after she agreed to let them tear-gas the compound because she was
not on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, several tank-riding FBI agents testified they saw
smoke wafting from the thin wooden walls of the complex shortly
after canisters of tear gas were fired into the Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers say sect leader David Koresh and some 80
followers intentionally started three fires that quickly engulfed
the complex and ended the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Tom Rowan testified he fired as many as 80 so-called
''ferret rounds'' -- plastic canisters containing tear gas -- into
the complex to force Davidians from the complex. Experts say ferret
rounds are not considered incendiary devices.
</P>
<P>
   But Caddell attempted to get the agent to talk about more
incendiary munitions, asking if the FBI used ''military rounds,''
metallic canisters that potentially could be flammable devices.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by government attorneys, Rowan and other
agents said they observed what appeared to be muzzle flashes from
gunfire in several windows before the fire started.

<HEADLINE> Thumb Cut Affects Rocker's Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A small abrasion on John Rocker's left thumb is
still bothering the Atlanta Braves' struggling closer.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has 11 saves in 12 chances, but the hard-throwing
left-hander has a 5.85 ERA and has walked 30 walks in 20 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He first noticed the small split on the left side of his
thumbnail in February, describing it as ''the kind of thing you get
in the winter time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, every time Rocker has gotten loose in the bullpen,
the split has opened up. He has tried using Super Glue, which often
helps pitchers in similar predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it hurts, Rocker said, ''What do you think? Just look
at it. It's never healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker declined to discuss recent comments he made in Baseball
Weekly regarding his plans to ride the subway when the Braves visit
the New York Mets for a four-game series beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old has been the subject of controversy since
December, when Sports Illustrated published disparaging remarks he
made regarding several minority groups and his own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a 14-day suspension, he returned to the Braves on
April 18. After pitching badly and confronting the reporter who
wrote the SI article, he was sent to the minors, then recalled June
14.
</P>
<P>
   In his last outing, Rocker gave up five runs, four walks and one
hit in only one-third of an inning Wednesday against the Chicago
Cubs.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A city police sergeant was convicted
Friday of violating the civil rights of two prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Beauchamp, 35, was the highest ranking of six police
officers indicted last year after an investigation into allegations
of sexual misconduct within the Hartford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-day trial, a jury in U.S. District Court
deliberated for three hours before convicting Beauchamp on two
counts of federal civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim that at various times, Beauchamp took the
prostitutes in his cruiser to secluded spots in Hartford's South
End, urinated in front of each of them, fondled one of them, and
during one incident, directed one of the women to perform an erotic
dance for a retiring captain.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp faces up to 2 years in prison and $200,000 in fines
when he is sentenced on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is above the law,'' said U.S. Attorney Stephen C.
Robinson in announcing the verdict. ''When a police officer abuses
the power that is entrusted to him, he hurts not only the victim,
but he hurts the community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp was the first of those indicted to go to trial. Four
others have pleaded guilty to similar charges. A sixth still faces
a trial on civil rights charges later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp maintained his innocence and testified on his own
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to scream it out,'' Beauchamp testified on Thursday.
''In my career, at no time did I do anything that weird or
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed himself as a crusader against the prostitutes,
pimps, johns, and drug dealers that plagued sections of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ran the best unit this city has ever seen. I made an impact
on the street,'' Beauchamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp was suspended from the force following his arrest. A
call seeking comment was left Friday with acting Hartford Police
Chief Deborah Barrows.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Beauchamp said he believes his career is over. He
said it's difficult for police officers these days to defend
themselves against such accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we were faced with, I don't think I had a chance,''
Beauchamp said.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 7, Indians 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- For the moment, Juan Gonzalez is still with
Detroit. And the Tigers are still making life miserable for the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, whose stance Friday was he would accept a trade to the
New York Yankees as long as he didn't have to sign a contract
extension, had two hits and scored twice as the Tigers held on for
a 7-6 win over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (4-1) allowed five hits in 6 2-3 innings as the
Tigers improved to 5-4 against the Indians this season while
dropping Cleveland to 15-16 at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Last-place Detroit, just 8-32 at the Jake, took two of three at
home from the Indians last weekend, putting second-place Cleveland
farther back in the AL Central race behind Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Clark hit a two-run homer off Jamie Navarro (0-1) and Juan
Encarnacion had three hits and two RBIs for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice and Kenny Lofton homered for the Indians, who
can't seem to get the big hit when they need one.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who got a no-decision in a start against Cleveland last
Sunday, walked two and struck out five. The walks came with one out
in the sixth, but Blair got Justice to ground into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez couldn't come up with Travis Fryman's RBI triple off
the wall with two outs in the eighth, and Justice hit an RBI double
off Doug Brocail as the Indians closed within 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Jones allowed the tying run to reach second with one
out in the ninth before striking out Omar Vizquel and Roberto
Alomar for his league-leading 20th save. Jones has saved 71 percent
of Detroit's wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took a 5-1 lead while chasing Navarro in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez doubled with one out, and one out later, Clark homered
onto the home-run porch in left field. It was Clark's ninth homer
of the season and fourth in a week since returning from the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Four Tigers followed with singles as Deivi Cruz and Luis Polonia
had run-scoring hits.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's two-run homer, a 418-foot shot to center, brought the
Indians within 5-3 in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Encarnacion's two-run single in the fourth off Brian
Williams helped the Tigers go up 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's homer in the first tied it 1-1. Justice, who missed
the last two games with a strained abdominal muscle, was just
1-for-24 in his career against Blair before connecting for his 20th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro, making his second start against the Tigers after being
signed on June 16 by Cleveland, allowed five runs and nine hits in
just 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers, who hit eight homers Tuesday in Toronto, have
17 homers in their last seven game and 21 in nine. ... Gonzalez
declined comment before the game, but seemed to enjoy himself while
signing autographs with fans during batting practice. ... The left
side of Cleveland's infield -- 3B Fryman and SS Vizquel -- have
combined to make just one error in 70 games. Fryman's error in an
April 18 game against Oakland is the pair's only miscue. Vizquel
hasn't had an error in 71 straight games. Fryman had several
excellent stops Friday night. By contrast, the Tigers' left side
has 19 errors. ... The teams play a day-night doubleheader
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mets 12, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza's three-run homer triggered a
nine-run third inning that carried the New York Mets and
right-hander Bobby Jones to a 12-2 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fifth time in team history that the Mets scored
as many as nine runs in an inning and missed the club record by
one.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (2-3), recalled from the minors before the start, won for
the first time since May 19 by allowing just five hits in eight
innings with three walks and eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's homer, his 21st, came after a walk to Derek Bell and a
single by Edgardo Alfonzo off Pirates starter Bronson Arroyo.
Arroyo (0-1), making only his third major-league start, allowed 10
runs -- nine earned -- on nine hits and three walks in 2 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the first five batters but balked home a run in the
third with the bases loaded and two outs when Todd Zeile bluffed a
break to the plate and Arroyo stopped his motion.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morris' sacrifice fly made it 1-1 in the third but the
Mets answered with nine in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza drove in the first three and Jay Payton singled in
another before Melvin Mora's bases-loaded double scored three more.
Mora moved to third on a fielding error by left fielder Wil Cordero
and scored on Derek Bell's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Bell reached second on a throwing error charged to third baseman
Aramis Ramirez and scored when Alfonzo greeted reliever Jeff
Wallace with a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   New York added two more runs on RBI singles by Benny Agbayani in
the fourth and sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Rodriguez pitched the ninth for the Mets and allowed an RBI
single by Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets last scored nine runs in the sixth inning at
Florida May 26, 1998. New York scored 10 against Cincinnati on June
12, 1979. ... Piazza has seven home runs in his last 12 games. ...
Pirates have lost six of seven at Shea Stadium.

   Monica Maxwell scored 15 points to lead Indiana (3-7), which cut

<HEADLINE> Israel Hopes To Be Off Money List  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Citing pending legislation, Israel said Friday
it hopes it will soon be removed from a black list of 15 countries
suspected of failing to cooperate in the international fight
against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law enforcement officials have acknowledged that
international money laundering is a multibillion dollar problem in
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   A top police investigator recently called Israel ''the promised
land for money laundering'' because it has no law making it illegal
to handle funds from organized crime that are invested in
legitimate businesses as launderings.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's justice minister, Yossi Beilin, hopes to change that.
The government has sponsored legislation requiring banks and
financial institutions to report large transactions. Violators
could face several years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has passed two readings in parliament and is expected
to win final approval in July, before the Knesset goes into summer
recess, said legislator Zipi Livni, who chaired a subcommittee on
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a high-level international task force named Israel
as one of 15 countries suspected of failing to cooperate in the
fight against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Task force president Gil Galvao said the group would advise
countries on the list on how to strengthen laws and monitoring
aimed at reducing money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The report called on international financial institutions to pay
special attention to all transactions involving the
''noncooperative'' countries and territories on the list, which
also includes Russia and a number of Caribbean island nations.
</P>
<P>
   Livni, the legislator, said Friday that she hoped Israel would
soon be stricken from the black list. ''I hope that when they (the
members of the task force) get the information that we are at the
end of the legislative process, they will take us off the list,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Sedbon, Israel's top police investigator of
money laundering schemes, said that even if the legislation is
passed, it might take three years to set up a data base to
following illicit financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Sedbon has blamed Israel's immigration policies for part of the
problem. Jews get automatic citizenship here. With an Israeli
passport, a courier can enter many countries without a visa.

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker bounced back from an awful outing to
strike out the side in the ninth inning, preserving the Atlanta
Braves' 3-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the controversial reliever gave up five runs, four
walks and one hit in one-third of an inning against the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   This time, got his second save since May 18, his 12th in 13
chances this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker relieved to start the ninth and struck out James Mouton
leading off, then walked Jose Hernandez, Rocker's 31st walk in 21
innings. He then fanned Henry Blanco and Lyle Mouton, raising his
season strikeout total to 33.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga hit his 18th homer and an RBI double to back
John Burkett, who left after six innings with a 2-1 lead. But Jason
Marquis (1-0) allowed Marquis Grissom's homer leading off the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras' sacrifice fly in the eighth off David Weathers
(3-3) drove in the go-ahead run. Wally Joyner led off with a
double, Bobby Bonilla walked, pinch-runner Trenidad Hubbard
advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher Henry Blanco and
scored on Veras' fly.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett allowed five hits, taking a shutout into the sixth
before Charlie Hayes' RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won consecutive games for the first time since June 9-10
against Boston. With a record of 10-12 in June, Atlanta is seeking
to avoid its first losing month since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee starter Jason Bere, making his first career appearance
against Atlanta, gave up two runs and three hits in six innings and
struck out five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bere has surrendered at least one homer in 10 of his last
12 starts. ... The Braves improved to 15-2 when Galarraga homers.
... Milwaukee dropped to 3-7 at Turner Field and 6-17 against
Atlanta. ... The Brewers are 11-18 against the NL East this season.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Florida Aircraft Collision  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- A Lear jet and a small stunt plane
collided and crashed into a golf course community, killing the
three people aboard the jet and the pilot of the second craft.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the ground was injured when the planes crashed in one
heap and burned inside the gated Boca Grove Plantation community
and on the adjoining golf course, said Paul Miller, spokesman for
the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit and an engine from the Lear jet landed within feet
of a three-story condominium and the building was damaged by the
ensuing fire. Residents, mostly elderly, were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller debris landed on roofs and in yards in an area
authorities said spanned about one mile.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear jet had just taken off from Boca Raton Airport when it
apparently hit the second aircraft, an Extra 300 one-seater coming
from Willis Flight Port in Boynton Beach, about 10 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the stunt plane, a member of the U.S. Aerobatics
team, apparently tried to jump from his aircraft after the
collision, and his body was found wrapped in a parachute, Miller
said. It is not clear whether his parachute had deployed. Pilots
flying stunt planes are required to wear parachutes, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The larger plane ''looked like it split in half, the front half
of the plane buckling underneath it and the thing basically dropped
out of the sky like a rock,'' said Dean Kallan, who works in an
office complex across the street.

   Jack Shoenfelt, the Boca Grove Golf Course's pro, said there
were about 30 players on the course when a large section of the

   Golfer and subdivision resident Edward Brill said a man and
woman were about to tee off when the planes fell.

It was headed to Fort Pierce, about 80 miles to the north, to be

   The Extra 300 pilot was identified by friends and neighbors as
John Lillberg, a member of the U.S. Aerobatics team since 1991 and
a retired Pratt &AMP; Whitney engineer who had been flying since about
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He performed for and held competitions here,'' said neighbor

<HEADLINE> Hartford Sergeant Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A police sergeant was convicted Friday of
violating the civil rights of two prostitutes he took in his patrol
car to secluded spots where he forced them to watch while he
exposed himself and urinated.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Beauchamp, 35, was one of six police officers indicted
last year after an investigation into allegations of sexual
misconduct within the Hartford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp was also accused of fondling one of the women and,
during one incident, directed one of them to perform an erotic
dance for a retiring captain.
</P>
<P>
   He was in uniform and on duty at the time of the crimes,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp, who maintained his innocence, faces up to 2 years in
prison and $200,000 in fines when he is sentenced on Sept. 11. He
had been suspended from the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Beauchamp said he believes his career is over. He
said it's difficult for police officers to defend themselves
against such accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we were faced with, I don't think I had a chance,''
Beauchamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp was the first of those indicted to go to trial. Four
others have pleaded guilty to similar charges. A sixth faces a
trial on civil rights charges later this summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Blue Jays moved into first place in the AL
East as Frank Castillo won his third straight start to beat the
Boston Red Sox 5-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit a go-ahead, two-run homer for the Blue Jays,
and Brad Fullmer and Jose Cruz Jr. also connected.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, which moved a half-game ahead of Boston, had not led
the division this late in the season since 1993, the year the Blue
Jays won their second straight World Series title. The Blue Jays
began the night in third place, three percentage points behind the
second-place Yankees, who played a later game at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, which overcame a two-run deficit to extend its winning
streak to three, had not led this season since April 5, when it was
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo (4-5) allowed four runs and six hits in 7 1-3 innings,
retiring 15 straight before consecutive doubles by Darren Lewis and
Jeff Frye with one out in the eighth pulled Boston to 5-3. Carl
Everett then hit an RBI double off of Billy Koch, who got four outs
for his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   John Wasdin (0-3), making his first start since 1998, gave up
five runs and seven hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Solo homers by Trot Nixon in the first and Everett in the second
put Boston ahead, but Toronto tied it in the second on Fullmer's
homer and Homer Bush's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's 17th homer gave Toronto a 4-2 lead in the third, and
Cruz added his 16th in the fourth. The Blue Jays, who have homered
in a club record 21 straight games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castillo has pitched at least six innings in eight of his
last 10 tarts and has allowed just five earned runs in his last 21
1-3 innings. ... Delgado extended his hitting streak to 17 games.
... Nomar Garciaparra, who injured his right shoulder in a
collision with Carl Everett on Thursday night, was at designated
hitter and went 0-for-3 with a walk. It was Latin night at SkyDome.
A salsa band performed, and the PA announcer spoke Spanish

<HEADLINE> Clinton Salutes U.S. Olympians  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he has learned
a few things from attending every Democratic convention since 1972,
chief among them that polls don't matter much before a convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the convention it matters a lot,'' Clinton told an
audience of Democrats working to produce the party's national
nominating convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is behind in the polls, although Clinton
did not mention that fact in a portion of his remarks inadvertently
broadcast to reporters. The White House later said the speech was a
chance to thank campaign workers, as opposed to a fund-raising
event, and was supposed to be closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the convention, because the American people are
fundamentally fair-minded and open, they are open to us, just like
they are open to the Republicans,'' Clinton said. ''And it is
important that we show how different we are but that we do it in a
way that is fundamentally positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's newly named campaign manager William Daley also gave a
pep talk, as did the convention's chief fund raiser, Terry
McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered a slightly more relaxed version of his
standard political speech, which reminds Democratic donors of what
Clinton calls the big differences between the parties. Now that the
primaries are over and Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the presumptive
nominee, Republicans would prefer that voters forget how stark the
differences are, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks preceded Friday's round of three official
fund-raising speeches, which are open to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is on a three-day West Coast money hunt that is expected
to raise millions for Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, and other party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Clinton gave the only nonpolitical speech
scheduled during the trip, when he marveled at the prowess and
dedication of young Olympic hopefuls and lamented the decline of
regular gym classes for ordinary students.
</P>
<P>
   At the United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista,
Calif., Clinton told athletes and trainers he is worried that too
many schools ignore art, music and gym classes that help prepare
youngsters for healthy lives, if not for Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know it has an effect on learning, on self-image, on
self-esteem, on a sense of what you can do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about three in ten high school students are enrolled in
daily physical education classes, nearly a third fewer than a
decade ago, according to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Himself a hobbyist golfer and erstwhile jogger, Clinton shook
his head in wonder at the 6-hour-plus daily training routine of
women Olympic rowers, and applauded as perfectly muscled men and
women demonstrated the triple jump and the pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize that most of these things I can't do anymore,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   June 23 marks the 106th anniversary of the founding of the
modern Olympic Games. American athletes are training in Chula Vista
for the 2000 games to be held this September in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said although he would like to go, daughter Chelsea will
likely be the family representative at those games.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife is in a competition of her own and I am informed my
services may be needed elsewhere,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed federal agencies to help involve more
youngsters in physical education and fitness. He also noted that
June is also the anniversary of the 1972 passage of ''Title IX,''
the federal guarantee that women's athletics must be treated
equally with men's programs in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The president also issued a largely redundant order that
officially applies the same standard to education and training
programs offered directly by the federal government.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Baltimore's Cal Ripken did not start in Friday
night's game against the Seattle Mariners because of a sore lower
back, a condition that has bothered him this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 12th time the 39-year-old third baseman miss a start
this season. He was used as the Orioles' designated hitter in an
11-4 loss at Seattle on Thursday night and went 1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   The nerves in his lower back are inflamed. Ripken had back
surgery last September.

<P>
   Ripken has started 55 games at third base and four as the
Orioles' designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just precautionary as much as anything,'' manager Mike
Hargrove said before Friday night's game. ''He'll play tomorrow and
Sunday. I talked to him last night after the game and proposed this
to him.''

   Ripken was 2-for-18 in his last five games and was hitting .253

<HEADLINE> Glitches Mar Canadian Party Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- Officials scrambled Friday to correct a series of
glitches and irregularities marring the leadership vote for a new
Canadian party trying to unify the country's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Alliance -- which seeks to combine the former Reform
Party, based in western Canada, with disgruntled Conservative Party
supporters -- began its leadership elections with Alliance members
voting by telephone on Wednesday. The contest was to be completed
Saturday with people voting in booths across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If none of the four major contenders receives more than 50
percent, a July 8 runoff will be held between the two top
finishers. The winner will become the opposition leader in Canada's
parliament, and likely the main challenger for Prime Minister Jean
Chretien's job in national elections expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of logistical problems began with the telephone voting
this week, along with allegations of vote-buying and other
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Some members complained they never received the security code
and information needed to cast a telephone vote, while others in
eastern Quebec's Gaspe region said they had received notices even
though they were not members. Some politicians from other parties
also said they had received Alliance membership cards.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, Tom Long, apologized for what he called
overzealous party workers who tried to sell as many memberships as
possible to boost his chances of winning the leadership vote. In
some cases, Long admitted, his campaign had given memberships to
people it never contacted, including about 700 in the Gaspe region.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, though, the Alliance announced that 1,400 names had
been removed from the membership roll in Gaspe. It said a total of
25,000 members had voted by telephone by midday Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The other major candidates refrained from criticizing Long for
the irregularities, saying some glitches were to be expected.
Preston Manning -- who founded the Reform Party in the 1980s and
engineered the Alliance's creation -- noted that no other Canadian
party conducted such a widespread leadership contest allowing each
party member an equal vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance formed three months ago with over 70,000 members,
almost all from the Reform Party. It now says 200,000 people have
paid the $6.50 fee to be eligible to vote, but it was unclear how
many had actively signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Most members were to vote Saturday, with the results expected
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Questions persist about the potential cohesiveness of Canada's
political right, which appears split on abortion, gay rights and
capital punishment -- divisions that reflect the diversity of the
nation's 30 million people spread across the world's second-largest
country.
</P>
<P>
   Little common ideological ground exists among farmers in the
plains, urban dwellers who are part of the high-tech economy and
large immigrant communities that benefit from liberal social
policies.

<P>
	   NEW YORK MILLS, N.Y. (AP) - A postal service worker who noticed
mail piling up at the home of an elderly customer helped find the
woman - alive - five days after she fell and was unable to get up.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Faubert has delivered Helen Niziolek's mail for 11 years and
on Friday, he noticed something was amiss. Mail and newspapers were
building up at the 80-year-old woman's house. Her car was in the
driveway; he didn't think she was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   When he knocked on the door, he got no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought: something's not right,'' he told the
Observer-Dispatch of Utica. So he called New York Mills Police
Chief Stephen Verminski who came and found Niziolek lying on the
kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Niziolek had been lying there since Sunday night when she fell
and was dehydrated, Verminski said. She was in fair condition
Friday night at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Faubert said he felt guilty he hadn't acted earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone was watching over her,'' he said. ''That's a happy
ending.''

<HEADLINE> Sausage Factory Owner Called Police  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN VALLES
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) -- A sausage factory owner accused of
killing three government meat inspectors called police 15 minutes
before the attack, saying they were ''trespassing'' and he wanted
them removed, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The call from Stuart Alexander came three minutes after the lead
inspector had called police for help in defusing the potentially
volatile situation. The agents had discovered Alexander was selling
uninspected meat and had come to cite him for operating without a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   San Leandro police didn't immediately respond to either phone
call Wednesday, since neither caller suggested immediate danger,
and the officers on duty were involved in more pressing matters,
Lt. Marc DeCoulode said.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer arrived, on a bicycle, more than 18 minutes
after the initial call, when someone called 911 to say that nearly
20 shots had been fired at the Santos Linguisa factory.
</P>
<P>
   A SWAT team member later found federal meat inspectors Tom
Quadros, 52, and Jeannie Hillery, 56, and state inspector Bill
Shaline, 57, laying face down on the factory floor, their bodies
shot multiple times.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, 39, allegedly shot the three inspectors while a
fourth inspector waited outside for police. Authorities say
Alexander chased the fourth inspector for more than two blocks,
firing until he ran out of bullets. The state inspector escaped
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Alexander returned to the factory and fired more bullets
into the inspectors' bodies, before laying down his gun, locking
the factory and surrendering to the bicycle officer, saying ''I'm
the one you're looking for,'' according to an FBI affidavit filed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who was charged Friday morning with two federal
murder counts, appeared calm during a brief court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in shock right now,'' said his lawyer, Stuart Hanlon.
''This is certainly nothing he ever wanted to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A scheduled arraignment in state court on charges of murder with
special circumstances and attempted murder was delayed until July
11 giving prosecutors time to decide where he will be tried first.
He could face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to know at the time of the phone calls -- at
about 3:19 p.m. and 3:21 p.m. Wednesday -- that any violence was
imminent, DeCoulode said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A call was made by Mr. Quadros requesting what we call a civil
standby. Normally people do that just because they want an officer
there to keep the peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeCoulode said both Quadros and Alexander were told that police
would send someone when they could, and both replied that this was
OK with them.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has a history of hostility toward government
inspectors. His factory closed and reopened recently as he
struggled to meet health code requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Quadros also had asked for police help before in dealing with
Alexander, and officers came along for a previous visit, March 9,
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Quadros' 22-year-old son, Chris, said his father had talked
about a continuing conflict with Alexander. Tom Quadros told his
son he took San Leandro police along several weeks ago to shut down
the small plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was dealing with cows and sausage,'' Chris
Quadros said. ''Guns were never a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has also run into legal and financial troubles,
including a 1996 arrest on suspicion of assault with a deadly with
a deadly weapon. The charges were dropped when he paid his neighbor
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service issued a warning about sausage from the factory,
saying it may have been undercooked, prepared under unsanitary
conditions or produced without federal inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Because the agency does not require plants to provide
distribution data, officials don't know how widely the products
were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The packages that contain the suspect meat have the USDA mark of
inspection that reads ''EST. 8279.'' The FSIS said the mark may
have been used without approval.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Hostage Release Talks Break  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Talks between Fiji's military rulers and
gunmen holding 31 members of the deposed government hostage broke
down for several hours Saturday, dampening hopes the captives would
be released soon. But negotiations resumed in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama and rebel leader
George Speight met Saturday to look over the final draft of an
accord which negotiators on both sides said Friday would pave the
way for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   But Bainimarama left the meeting after less than 20 minutes
without signing the accord, a military spokesman told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama returned to the meeting in the capital city of Suva
a few hours later, however, signaling a resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji reported that the talks broke down because Speight
balked at a timetable for the release of the hostages proposed by
Bainimarama.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama wanted the hostages -- which include former Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- released within three hours of the
signing, Radio Fiji reported.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would have ended a standoff at parliament which entered
its 37th day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also expected to scrap some of Fiji's democratic
traditions, reduce the rights of its ethnic Indian minority, grant
an amnesty to the gunmen and disable the already struggling
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Because it falls short of returning Fiji to democracy, the deal
would likely have done little to ease the South Pacific nation's
economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's main demands were the ousting of Chaudhry's
government, the scrapping of Fiji's multiracial constitution, and
an amnesty for him and his men.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands had already been accepted by the military, and
this week's talks were to sort out details of an interim civilian
government that Bainimarama said would lead Fiji to new elections
within two years, and the scope of the amnesty to Speight's armed
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and an armed gang declared a coup after storming
parliament on May 19, taking Chaudhry, an ethnic Indian, and other
members of his government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims to be acting on behalf of the indigenous
majority, whose rights, he said, were trampled upon by Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the coup attempt, some indigenous Fijians
launched attacks on ethnic Indians, looting homes and businesses.
Fiji's military quickly took over and declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama is among many powerful Fijians who have said they
understand and even sympathize with Speight's cause, but also see
his coup as too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, the nation's cash crop, is at the core of Fiji's
troubles. Indian farmers built the industry by operating
plantations on land that is communally owned by indigenous Fijians
and leased at low rates set by English colonial law.
</P>
<P>
   Those leases are due to be renewed, and the refusal by
Chaudhry's government to accept demands for higher rents on the
land enraged many Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The military spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press that the breakdown in talks came despite the
military giving in to another of Speight's demands -- that the
martial law regime hand power to the interim civilian government
after three weeks, rather the 12-week timetable Bainimarama had
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of six straight days of talks, Jo Brown, a government
negotiator, said on Friday an agreement had been reached. Speight's
spokesman Jo Nata agreed to it.

<HEADLINE> Columbus NHL Team Adds Some Faces  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Three years after being granted a
franchise and 84 days before their first exhibition game, the
Columbus Blue Jackets took 26 players in Friday's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise finally has a face.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached the pinnacle now with the team,'' said principal
owner John H. McConnell. ''We've got flesh-and-blood guys. That's
more than the numbers and talk that we had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The next job is retaining the players they really want. The list
of draftees includes six unrestricted free agents who can sign
elsewhere on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus president and general manager Doug MacLean said he
would work hard to get defensemen Lyle Odelein and Mathieu
Schneider and forward Dallas Drake under contract in the next eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully we'll have a chance to sign them. If not, we'll get
compensatory picks, although I don't want to go that route,''
MacLean said by telephone from the draft in Calgary, Alberta. ''It
would be a major coup if we got these guys signed.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean called Odelein ''one of the toughest, most solid,
dependable defenseman and leaders in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Odelein, 31, is a physical backliner who played 57 games with
eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey before being dealt to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who turned 31 last week, played 80 games last year
for the New York Rangers. Like Odelein, his resume includes more
than 700 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, yet another 31-year-old veteran forward, played 79 games
for Phoenix, scoring 15 goals and totaling 45 points.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean also had a busy day making trades. The Blue Jackets took
forward Turner Stevenson from Montreal, then dealt him to New
Jersey as compensation for the deal that brought enforcer Krzysztof
Oliwa to Columbus last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jackets also acquired a second-round pick in the 2001
entry draft from Montreal in exchange for selecting goalie Frederic
Chabot.
</P>
<P>
   In a trade with Buffalo, MacLean acquired defenseman Jean-Luc
Grand-Pierre and right wing Matt Davidson, along with fifth-round
draft picks this year and next for agreeing to take goalie Dwayne
Roloson and left wing Geoff Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
   The deal prevented Buffalo from losing defensemen Richard
Smehlik and Jason Wooley to the Blue Jackets or the other expansion
team, the Minnesota Wild.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson had 26 points in 67 games last year for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm obviously very excited about going to Columbus,''
Sanderson said. ''I've heard a lot of good things about the
organization. It looks like we've got some good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Others selected by the Blue Jackets include Pittsburgh forward
Tyler Wright, Ottawa forward Kevin Dineen and Toronto forward Kevyn
Adams, who played his college hockey at Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some better skilled forwards than maybe we really
anticipated getting,'' assistant general manager Jim Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said the Blue Jackets were able to get quality players
and good value. The team will most likely have around $18 million
invested in its roster for its NHL debut.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've left ourselves ample room to work through the summer,''
MacLean said. ''That obviously was part of our philosophy going
into today, to leave ourselves some room, some flexibility.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies 13, Expos 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal and Mickey Morandini each fell a
hit short of the cycle and Scott Rolen had a three-run homer and
four RBIs as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Montreal Expos 13-6
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal had a home run, double and single and scored four
runs, while Morandini had a single, double and triple with three
RBIs to lead the Phillies' 17-hit barrage against five Expos
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   David Coggin (1-0), who had never pitched above Double-A, won in
his major league debut. He allowed six runs -- five earned -- on
eight hits over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Pat Burrell chipped in with three RBIs as the Phillies
won for the sixth time in their last eight games, including four of
five.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal homered leading off the second, hit a two-out single
and scored Philadelphia's second run in the fourth, and doubled in
the Phillies' five-run fourth. He fouled out to the catcher leading
off the seventh and was hit by a pitch in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen hit his 15th homer off Javier Vazquez (6-4) in the fifth
to ignite a five-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   With the Phillies leading 2-1, Doug Glanville singled and Ron
Gant walked to begin the fifth. Bobby Abreu grounded to short to
force Gant before Rolen hit his homer.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal doubled and Pat Burrell also doubled to make it 6-1
and chase Vazquez.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini, who struck out in the second and doubled home
Lieberthal in fourth, followed with an RBI single off reliever
Felipe Lira to give Philadelphia a six-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez allowed nine hits and seven runs in 4 1-3 innings. He
struck out six and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal answered with five runs in the bottom half of the
fifth, including Rondell White's RBI single, Vladimir Guerrero's
two-run triple and Lee Stevens' run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini drew a two-out walk in the seventh and scored from
first to make it 8-6 on Desi Relaford's RBI double, then capped
Philadelphia's five-run eighth, which included Rolen's RBI single
and Burrell's two-run single, with an RBI triple.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lieberthal has six career triples, none this season.
Morandini has not homered this season. ... Philadelphia scored a
season-high 15 runs and had a season-high 21 hits on May 4 against
Cincinnati. ... Guerrero has 44 extra-base hits this season,
including 17 doubles, seven triples, and 20 home runs.

<HEADLINE> Ghaffari Keeps Olympic Dream Alive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Matt Ghaffari kept his Olympic hopes alive Friday
by winning the 286-pound division of the Greco-Roman challenge
tournament in the U.S. wrestling trials.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old wrestler from Avon Lake, Ohio, rallied from a
1-0 second-round deficit at Reunion Arena for a 3-1 victory over
Dremiel Byers of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Ghaffari, trying to qualify for his third straight Olympics,
will meet reigning U.S. champion Rulon Gardner on Saturday in a
best-of-three match to determine who will advance to the Olympics
in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want my last match being a mini-tournament,'' said
Ghaffari, the silver medalist in the 1996 Olympics who has six U.S.
titles and four world championships. ''I want to make the Olympic
team to carry the flag and bring wrestling some attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghaffari began his day with a 1-0 overtime decision over Billy
Pierce of Minneapolis. Then he was forced to gamble against Byers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no fear, no doubt,'' Ghaffari said. ''My heart knows
that I'm a 2000 Olympian. ... I knew that he was ahead and I had to
score, so I tried some stuff I used in high school. ... I took a
chance because I had nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Akin of Madison, Wis., opened Friday night's freestyle
challenge finals with a 7-6 victory over Stephen Abas of Fresno,
Calif., in the 119-pound division.
</P>
<P>
   Akin will face U.S. champion Sammie Henson in a best-of-three
series Saturday for a spot on U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Other freestyle challenge winners were: Terry Brands of Iowa
City, Iowa, at 127.75; Bill Zadick of Iowa City, Iowa, at 138.75;
Chris Bono of Sunkist Kids at 152; Brian Dolph of Ridley Park, Pa.,
at 167.5; Lee Fullhart of Iowa City, Iowa, at 187.25; Dominic Black
of the U.S. Army at 213.75, and Stephen Neal of Bakersfield,
Calif., at 286.
</P>
<P>
   In Greco-Roman, Garrett Lowney, 20, of Appleton, Wis., provided
the biggest surprise of the session with a 4-0 decision over Dave
Surofchek of Colorado Springs, Colo., at 213.75. Lowney advanced to
the final against Jason Gleasman, also of Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Other Greco-Roman challenge tournament winners were: Steven Mays
of the U.S. Navy at 119, Jim Gruenwald of Colorado Springs at
127.75, Glenn Nieradka of the U.S. Army at 138.75, Chris Saba of
Colorado Springs at 152, Keith Sieracki of the Army at 167.5, and
Ethan Bosch of Colorado Springs at 187.25.
</P>
<P>
   The Greco-Roman session also featured the longest match in U.S.
trials history -- a 26 minute, 30-second bout between Brian Keck of
the New York Athletic Club and Corey Farkas of Air Force at 286
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Keck won 4-3 in the match that surpassed the previous longest
bout of 19:58 between Buddy Lee and Dalen Wasmund in the 136.5
final Olympic Qualifier in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In a wild scramble during the final five seconds of the
evening's opening freestyle match, the 29-year-old Akin scored two
points and Abas managed one. Thirty-four seconds earlier, Akin's
reversal pulled him into a 5-5 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was something else,'' Akin said after excitedly jumping
around the ring and sprinting off the floor in celebration of his
rousing win.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great athlete. There was nothing I could really do
except let my effort flow through me. I knew there was no stopping
-- it was just time to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young, but he's awesome,'' Akin said of the 22-year-old
Abas. ''I pounded him when he was younger and he wants me bad. I
was beating him by 10 points a couple years ago, and now he's right
up there with me.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Would Accept Trade to N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Maybe Juan Gonzalez is coming to the Yankees,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the two-time AL MVP told New York and
Detroit on Friday that the Tigers outfielder would accept a trade
to the Yankees, but only without a contract extension, meaning he
could become a free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez refused to talk about the possible trade on Friday. But
he did laugh about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, not now,'' he said as he waved away reporters before the
Tigers game against the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bronner, Gonzalez's agent, would not comment directly on
what his client would do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked with both clubs,'' Bronner said. ''We indicated
something to both clubs. It's really something they have to work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's position on the tentative 3-for-1 trade agreed to
Thursday was confirmed to The Associated Press by a baseball source
who spoke on the condition he not be identified. Under a no-trade
clause in his contract, he can block a deal to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would send outfielder Ricky Ledee and a pair of
prospects to Detroit -- third baseman Drew Henson, Michigan's
probable starting quarterback, and pitcher Randy Keisler.
</P>
<P>
   New York, however, isn't likely to be interested in giving up
that much to have Gonzalez for little more than half a season. The
Yankees, according to a person familiar with the deal, viewed the
initial response as a bargaining stance. The sides were expected to
talk more during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and the Yankees were given an initial 72-hour window
Thursday by the commissioner's office to work out a new deal, but
New York seems unconcerned about any deadlines, working under the
assumption they can be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, watching New York's Class-A
team in Tampa, Fla., refused comment on Gonzalez, obtained by
Detroit from Texas in a nine-player trade during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking batting practice, Gonzalez found all the
speculation about him ending up in pinstripes amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Gonzalez walked into the Tigers' clubhouse, a TV report
from Chicago -- where the Yankees were playing the White Sox -- gave
the latest news about the deal. After listening in for a moment,
Gonzalez shook his head and then laughed out loud along with many
of his Tigers teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also are still pursuing a possible deal for the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ''A famous player and philosopher, Yogi Berra, said it right, it
ain't hardly over until it's over,'' Sosa's agent, Tom Reich, said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the thought of adding Gonzalez has everyone
dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's playing for a team that has a lot of young players and
they have an opportunity to be good but he has an opportunity to
come to a team that has done so well three of the last four
years,'' said Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams, who played
Little League with Gonzalez in Puerto Rico. ''The amount of boost
he would give to our lineup would be tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, speaking in Chicago, said he could understand
Gonzalez's reluctance to play in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some very good players who have refused to come here
and play,'' he said. ''I think it takes a special kind of
individual to play here, a player who is willing to sacrifice a
lot, keep his mouth shut and play through all kinds of expectations
for himself and the team, and is willing to win and play under all
kinds of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's great. It's the best place to play when you're
winning. It can also be hard. So I'm not surprised when some
players don't want to go through that aggravation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tigers manager Phil Garner said he's not expecting
Gonzalez to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything he has told us is that he wants to be here,''
Garner said. ''He wants to help make this club better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez entered Friday night's game batting .260 with 13 homers
and 30 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a beauty all year,'' Garner said. ''I'm planning to
have him for the rest of the year.''

<HEADLINE> Padres 10, Reds 7, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Bret Boone tormented his former club by
hitting three homers and Ruben Rivera added a three-run shot in the
10th inning Friday, powering the San Diego Padres to a 10-7 victory
over the reeling Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati tied it with three runs in the ninth off Trevor
Hoffman (1-2), who suffered only his second blown save in 20
chances and his first since April 25. Ken Griffey Jr.'s two-out,
two-run double tied it at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williamson (2-5), struggling to duplicate his rookie of
the year season, gave up Tony Gwynn's pinch double to open the
10th, then walked Boone intentionally with two outs. Rivera hit the
second pitch for his seventh homer, extending the Reds' free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has lost 13 of 16, tumbling to a distant second in
the NL Central. The Padres have played a leading role in the Reds'
month of misery, beating them four times in the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, traded from the Reds to Atlanta after the 1998 season,
has hit six of his 12 homers this season against Cincinnati. Two of
his three mulithomer games have been against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit a three-run homer in the fourth off Rob Bell, who was
promoted from Double-A in spring training and is losing his grip on
a job. Ryan Klesko also hit a solo homer in the fourth, his fourth
homer in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is 0-4 in his last four starts, giving up 16 runs in 15
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boone added a solo shot in the sixth off Manny Aybar for a
noteworthy repeat. He also homered off Bell and Aybar in the same
game in Cincinnati on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's two-run homer off Scott Sullivan in the eighth completed
the second three-homer game of his career. He hit three for
Cincinnati at Wrigley Field on Sept. 20, 1998. The six RBIs matched
Boone's career high.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman also made several impressive defensive plays
to help Adam Eaton, like Bell a rookie called up from Double-A this
season. Eaton gave up three runs on seven hits in 5 2-3 innings,
leaving him with a 2.39 ERA in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit a two-run homer, his 22nd, off Eaton in the fifth.
Griffey also homered for the Reds' only run off Eaton in the
Padres' 3-1 win last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Kevin Nicholson, the Padres' first-round draft pick in
1997, was called up from Triple-A and made his debut. He started
and went 0-for-2 before leaving as part of a double-switch.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Chris Stynes strained his left hamstring while
running out a single in the third and left the game. Pokey Reese,
who was supposed to get a day of rest, came on to pinch run and
play second base.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Boone has 11 multihomer games in his career. ... It's the
first time Klesko has homered in three consecutive games since
1997. ... Nicholson is the 12th rookie to play for the Padres this
season. ... San Diego has used 41 players this season, the same
number for all last season. The club record is 48 players in 1991.
... Gwynn was out of the lineup for a fifth straight game because
of a sore left knee. ... Reds pitchers are 0-for-21 since June 5.
Bell is 0-for-20 career with 14 strikeouts. ... A crowd of 31,746
showed up to watch the game and a postgame concert by The Spinners.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jackets, Wild Draft Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- The Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue
Jackets stocked their rosters Friday in the NHL's expansion draft --
certainly not content just sticking with their new players.
</P>
<P>
   Wild general manager Doug Risebrough wasted no time in making
changes, dealing three selections.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Mike Vernon was taken from the Florida Panthers and
traded to the Calgary Flames, the team he helped to the 1989
Stanley Cup. In return, Minnesota gets Boston University center Dan
Cavanaugh and a future eighth-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Juneau was claimed from the Ottawa Senators and traded to
Phoenix for Swedish prospect Rickard Wallin, also a center.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Terreri, New Jersey's backup goalie, was taken from the
Devils and then traded back to the Stanley Cup champions for
defenseman Brad Bombardir.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus traded forward Turner Stevenson, taken from Montreal,
to the Devils as compensation for the deal that sent Krzysztof
Oliwa to the Blue Jackets just days after the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jackets also acquired a second-round pick in the 2001
entry draft from Montreal in exchange for selecting goalie Frederic
Chabot.
</P>
<P>
   Each club selected 26 players in the expansion draft, with each
of the existing clubs -- except for Nashville and Atlanta -- losing
two players each.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators and Thrashers, recent additions to the league,
were exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 26 players taken by Columbus were goalies Rick
Tabaracci, Dwayne Roloson and Frederic Chabot, defenseman Jamie
Pushor, Lyle Odelein, Mathieu Schneider and Bert Robertsson, and
forwards Geoff Sanderson, Kevin Dineen, Robert Kron, Steve Heinze,
Tyler Wright, Kevyn Adams, Dallas Drake and Bruce Gardiner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure how many we will have at training camp,'' general
manager Doug MacLean said. ''For the most part, the players on the
board are for the Blue Jackets, but I'm open to trade
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild also chose goalie Jamie McLennan, defensemen Sean
O'Donnell, Curtis Leschyshyn, Ladislav Benysek and Chris Armstrong,
and forwards Stacy Roest, Darryl Laplante, Scott Pellerin, Jim
Dowd, Sergei Krivokrasov, Jeff Nielsen, Jeff Odgers and Darby
Hendrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Risebrough suggested he'd be making fewer changes than MacLean
before his flurry of trades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the history of expansion that players are turned over
(before the first season begins),'' he said. ''We didn't go into
this looking for a lot of turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger name, high-ticket players such as Mark
Messier and Claude Lemieux went undrafted as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Side deals between the expansion clubs and the rest of the teams
were also secured before the draft, assuring that certain exposed
players would not be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo gave up promising defenseman Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre,
minor-league forward Matt Davidson and two fifth-round draft
choices -- the 149th pick in this weekend's entry draft and one next
year to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was done to ensure that the Sabres would not lose a
number of key players -- including forwards Doug Gilmour and Stu
Barnes, and defensemen Richard Smehlik and Jason Woolley -- left
exposed for the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild and Blue Jackets also signed a dozen free agents each
and will stockpile more players in Saturday's entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   The teams also picked up top goalies in advance as Columbus got
Marc Denis from Colorado, while Minnesota acquired Manny Fernandez
from Stanley Cup runner-up Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said he'd try to sign Odelein and Drake, taken from
Phoenix and impending free agents. The Blue Jackets are expected to
let Schneider, left unprotected by the New York Rangers, go to free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Dineen also will be an unrestricted free agent next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking for character and grit and leadership and we
feel strongly about Kevin Dineen,'' MacLean said. ''We'd love to
have Kevin in our opening-day roster and we really think there is a
chance of that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players are certain to be retained by Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, taken from Toronto, played college hockey at nearby Miami
of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a natural pick for us,'' MacLean said. ''After watching
him during the playoffs, we were happy to take him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, taken from Pittsburgh, ''is a young player with plenty
of speed and determination and grit -- the type of player we were
looking for,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Sanderson, taken from Buffalo, is another who will
play for the Blue Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most definitely,'' MacLean said. ''Geoff Sanderson will be in
our opening-day lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams followed the typical expansion blueprint of grabbing
young talent and surrounding it with character players who are not
saddled with large contracts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Teacher Education  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Improved teacher training, and not just more
computers in schools, will be necessary if all Americans are to
have equal access to the Internet, President Clinton says in a
magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   In this Sunday's edition of Access Magazine, Clinton says
increased teacher training is a major part of his technology
efforts. If the teacher isn't comfortable with the computer, the
new hardware won't help, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why I have proposed to double the amount of funding
available to ensure that all new teachers can use technology
effectively in the classroom,'' the president told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged parents to work with the schools to
accomplish the same goal.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police are they were investigating whether
the attack on a television news anchorwoman was organized by drug
traffickers, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly Tellez, a news anchorwoman of the national TV Azteca
network, was leaving the station in Mexico City late Thursday when
assailants opened fire on her car. Tellez escaped injury, but her
two bodyguards and her driver were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said witnesses saw three attackers traveling in two
separate cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''TV Azteca awaits the report of authorities about this
lamentable act,'' the network said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the shooting was unclear, but authorities were
investigating whether drug traffickers could have been behind the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez and TV Azteca generally have clashed with the city
attorney general's office in recent weeks over the official probe
into the murder of television host Paco Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The network has accused the city agency of harassing its owner
and employees, a claim city officials deny. The network recently
ran a documentary entitled ''Abuse of Power'' about the office.
</P>
<P>
   City police recently detained four of Tellez's heavily armed
bodyguards outside the house of local Attorney General Samuel Del
Villar, whom Tellez was trying to interview. The men revealed they
were federal policemen assigned to protect Tellez because of what
officials said were threats from drug traffickers over her
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez herself was embarrassed by the revelation she was using a
car that belonged to the Sonora state government, apparently
because her ex-husband had been the state's representative in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Stanley's killing was ordered by alleged
amphetamine smuggler Luis Amezcua Contreras. The case against
Amezcua is based largely on testimony from Luis Gabriel Valencia
Lopez, who authorities say worked as Amezcua's cook.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Amezcua, who is in jail on drug and
money-laundering charges, was angered that Stanley owed him money
for his cocaine habit and recruited Mario Rodriguez Bezares,
Stanley's television sidekick and the butt of most of his jokes, to
help carry it out in exchange for forgiving his own drug debt.

<HEADLINE> Officials Identify 4th Barrel Body  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISONVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- Authorities have identified the fourth
of five female bodies found stuffed in barrels in Kansas and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Sheila Dale Faith, 51, of Fullerton, Calif., was one
of three found June 5 in a Raymore storage locker rented by John
Edward Robinson Sr., prosecutor Chris Koster said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The identification was made by new dental records, he said.
Authorities were trying to determine whether the remaining
unidentified body was Faith's daughter, Debbie.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 56, of Olathe, Kan., has been charged with three
counts of first-degree murder, and is being held on $5 million
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Two other bodies were found June 3 on a tract owned by Robinson
near La Cygne, Kan., about 40 miles west of Raymore. The bodies
were in barrels found sitting on top of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also discovered links between Robinson and
four people -- three women and an infant -- missing since the
mid-1980s. None of those women has been identified as being among
the victims in the barrels.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Hostage Release Talks Resume  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Talks between Fiji's military rulers and
gunmen holding 31 members of the deposed government hostage broke
down for several hours Saturday, dampening hopes the captives would
be released soon. But negotiations resumed in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama and rebel leader
George Speight met Saturday to look over the final draft of an
accord which negotiators on both sides said Friday would pave the
way for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   But Bainimarama left the meeting after less than 20 minutes
without signing the accord, a military spokesman told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama returned to the meeting in the capital city of Suva
a few hours later, however, signaling a resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji reported that the talks broke down because Speight
balked at a timetable for the release of the hostages proposed by
Bainimarama.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama wanted the hostages -- which include former Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- released within three hours of the
signing, Radio Fiji reported.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would have ended a standoff at parliament which entered
its 37th day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also expected to scrap some of Fiji's democratic
traditions, reduce the rights of its ethnic Indian minority, grant
an amnesty to the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Because it falls short of returning Fiji to democracy, the deal
would likely have done little to ease the South Pacific nation's
economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's main demands were the ousting of Chaudhry's
government, the scrapping of Fiji's multiracial constitution, and
an amnesty for him and his men.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands had already been accepted by the military, and
this week's talks were to sort out details of an interim civilian
government that Bainimarama said would lead Fiji to new elections
within two years, and the scope of the amnesty to Speight's armed
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and an armed gang declared a coup after storming
parliament on May 19, taking Chaudhry, an ethnic Indian, and other
members of his government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims to be acting on behalf of the indigenous
majority, whose rights, he said, were trampled upon by Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the coup attempt, some indigenous Fijians
launched attacks on ethnic Indians, looting homes and businesses.
Fiji's military quickly took over and declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama is among many powerful Fijians who have said they
understand and even sympathize with Speight's cause, but also see
his coup as too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, the nation's cash crop, is at the core of Fiji's
troubles. Indian farmers built the industry by operating
plantations on land that is communally owned by indigenous Fijians
and leased at low rates set by English colonial law.
</P>
<P>
   Those leases are due to be renewed, and the refusal by
Chaudhry's government to accept demands for higher rents on the
land enraged many Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The military spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press that the breakdown in talks came despite the
military giving in to another of Speight's demands -- that the
martial law regime hand power to the interim civilian government
after three weeks, rather the 12-week timetable Bainimarama had
wanted.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 7, Rangers 4  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Gerald Williams led off the game with a
home run and later broke a tie with a sacrifice fly as Tampa Bay
beat the Texas Rangers 7-4 Friday night and extended Rick Helling's
losing streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (7-7) retired 14 batters in a row after the Williams
homer, but was chased from the game after the first four Devil Rays
in the seventh got hits, including an RBI double by Steve Cox and
an RBI single by Bobby Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Martinez greeted reliever Jeff Zimmerman with an RBI
single that tied the game at 4-4. Williams followed with his sac
fly to deep left that capped the four-run outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who had three hits and is 13-for-33 (.394) in eight games
since being recalled from Triple-A Durham, added a two-run homer in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Lidle (1-2) pitched six innings to win for the first time
as a major league starter. In his eighth major league start, the
former reliever struck out four with no walks and gave up four runs
on six hits, including unconventional back-to-back home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his ninth save in 14
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers led 4-1 in the fifth after Royce Clayton hit a
two-run homer and Luis Alicea followed by becoming the first Texas
player to hit an inside-the-park homer at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity by Alicea caromed off an angled wall in the
right-field corner and past Bubba Trammell. The ball rolled
parallel to the wall along the warning track and wasn't retrieved
by the right fielder until Alicea was already rounding third base.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough for Helling, who hasn't won since May 23 when
he beat Kansas City to improve to 7-1. He gave up seven hits -- just
three the first six innings -- with one strikeout and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   Like Helling, Lidle settled after a shaky start. He gave up
three singles in the first inning, including a run-scoring hit by
Ivan Rodriguez that tied the game at 1-1, before retiring 12
straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   Lidle's trouble began when Gabe Kapler singled with two outs in
the fifth. Clayton, who had just 15 hits his previous 90 at-bats,
then hit an 0-2 changeup for his 11th homer before Alicea hit a
full-count pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has a 27-game hitting streak against Tampa Bay, a
streak that began June 2, 1998. The longest streak by an active
player versus an opponent is Bobby Bonilla's 28 games in a row with
a hit against Detroit. Bonilla, now with Atlanta, hasn't played
against Detroit since June 18, 1997.
Notes: The Ballpark in Arlington, opened in 1994, has had two
other inside-the-park homers: by Kansas City's Michael Tucker on
Aug. 16, 1996, and the Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch on April 29, 1999.
... Two of Williams' three leadoff homers this season are against
Texas, which has allowed five leadoff homers. ... Williams, hitless
on Wednesday, has gone consecutive games without a hit only once
this season. ... Alicea has a nine-game hitting streak. ... Smith
is 13-for-27 (.481) at The Ballpark in his career. ... Rusty Greer
has six straight multi-hit games, and is 13-for-27 in that stretch.
... Rafael Palmeiro has gone 11 games without an extra-base hit.

<HEADLINE> Prado Wins All-Star Jockey Event  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- Edgar Prado won the all-star jockey
championship Friday night, coming from behind in the final race and
the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Prado pushed We Are Family from third to first in the final
stretch of the fourth race, giving him enough points to tie
hometown favorite Donnie Meche and win the championship by virtue
of a higher finish in the last event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on a mission,'' said Prado, who was drenched by water in
the winner's circle courtesy of fellow jockey Kent Desormeaux. ''I
was trying to aim between horses first and that didn't work out, so
I had to go for the railing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prado, who won an international jockey competition in Japan in
1994, paid $19.80 to win and Meche $7.60 to show. Both had 8-1
odds. Prado's prize was $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith, who went off at 16-1, finished third and paid $21 to
show.
</P>
<P>
   The exacta came in at $241.20 and the trifecta paid $6,082.60.
The event drew 15,315 to Lone Star Park.
</P>
<P>
   The event, sponsored by the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, offered a well-rounded test for the field of 12
jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   Running at four lengths and on two surfaces, the jockeys rode
four different horses rated from A (best) to D (worst). A win was
worth 12 points, second was six, third was four and fourth was
three.
</P>
<P>
   Prado was shut out in the first race, on his B horse, then got
on the board by finishing fourth in the second race. Then came a
third-place showing on his D horse, putting him mathematically in
contention -- but barely.
</P>
<P>
   To win, Prado needed to finish first and Meche, who had been
first, third and fourth in the first three races, had to be shut
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was going out, I saw the pole list and seven points, so
I knew I had a chance,'' Prado said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Perret led going into the final stretch of the final race,
and would've been the champion had he held on.
</P>
<P>
   But Prado bolted along the rail and Pat Day passed Perret on the
outside. Meche was never in contention and finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Perret's third-place finish in the last race left him fourth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Laffit Pincay Jr. was seventh. Shane Sellers,
who won the event in 1998, did not score a point.
</P>
<P>
   Meche's second-place was great considering that at 25 he was the
youngest rider and he had the fewest career victories. However, it
was disappointing because he was on top of the standings after one,
two and three races.
</P>
<P>
   Meche got into the field by virtue of being the best rider at
Lone Star this season. He almost had to drop out because of a
shoulder injury suffered 10 days ago while on a tube being pulled
by a boat.
</P>
<P>
   After staying out of competition more than a week, he won his
first race Wednesday night and rode twice more. He sat out Thursday
then showed he was in good shape Friday by winning a
non-championship race to open the night.
</P>
<P>
   His victory in the first championship race, aboard Dix Carat
d'Or, marked the first time a local rider has won a leg of the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith won the second event on Heavens Throne and Jorge
Chavez won the third aboard Bust the Record.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Lone Star Park president Corey Johnson announced
that the all-star event will remain at the track where it began
through 2003. Purses will be raised to $161,000 next year, $185,000
in 2002 and $200,000 in '03.
</P>
<P>
   The event supports the Jockeys' Guild Disabled Riders Fund. In
the previous three years, the all-star races have raised more than
$320,000.
