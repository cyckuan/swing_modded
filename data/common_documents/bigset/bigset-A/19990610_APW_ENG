<HEADLINE> Contraceptive Coverage Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women's groups are trying a new tack in their  
effort to force employers to include prescription contraceptives in 
health insurance coverage: It's against the law not to, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty groups are asking the Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission to instruct employers that excluding birth control pills 
and other contraceptives from their health plans amounts to sex 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the fight to toughen the law was renewed in Congress,  
where legislation to force insurance companies to cover 
contraception was reintroduced. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue gained steam last year when the male impotence drug  
Viagra came onto the market. Women's groups argued that it was 
unfair that many insurance companies covered Viagra and did not 
cover birth control, including the birth control pill, 
Depo-Provera, Norplant, diaphragms and intrauterine devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come to make sure women are no longer cheated  
with the insurance coverage they get,'' said Marcia D. Greenberger, 
co-president of the National Women's Law Center, which asked the 
EEOC to issue ``policy guidance'' to employers on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a policy would not be legally binding, but it could  
influence employers and would strengthen a lawsuit on the subject 
should one be filed. The Women's Law Center is also considering 
such a suit. 
</P>
<P>
	An EEOC spokesman, Michael Widomski, said the commission has  
never looked at the issue. Even if it decided to act, it would take 
at least several months to develop such a policy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including  
pregnancy-related discrimination, and the courts have struck down 
other insurance policies based on sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the issues is whether the coverage rules affect women  
differently from men, explained Suzanna Sherry, a law professor at 
the University of Minnesota and expert in sex discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument is compelling, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is taking the law a step beyond where it is right now, but  
it's not a huge step. It's a plausible one. But I wouldn't want to 
predict what the EEOC would do or a court would do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers oppose mandatory coverage, citing the cost. They also  
argue that denying contraceptive coverage is not sex-based -- it 
just happens that women are the only ones who can benefit from 
prescription contraceptives, said Kate Sullivan of the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of just denying a benefit to women,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, legislation to force coverage, which died in  
Congress last year, was reintroduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have equity. Women pay for contraceptives and  
insurance companies pay for Viagra. What's wrong with that 
picture?'' said Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., lead sponsor in the 
House. ``We're going to change that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would force insurance companies that cover  
prescriptions to include contraception. By contrast, the EEOC 
action would direct employers to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance industry says it is willing to offer whatever  
employers are willing to pay for. Better benefits cost more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, it's the employer that chooses,'' said Richard  
Coorsh of the Health Insurance Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress required that health plans for federal  
employees cover prescription contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of states require insurers that cover other  
prescriptions to include contraceptives, but those laws only apply 
to state-regulated insurance plans. The states include Maryland, 
Vermont, Nevada, Maine, Georgia and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey in 1994 by the Alan Guttmacher Institute found that  
about half of large group insurance plans cover no contraception 
and only a third cover birth control pills.

<HEADLINE> Study: Internet Impact Put at $301B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The impact of the Internet on the nation's  
economy exceeds $301 billion in revenues and accounts for more than 
1.2 million jobs, growing over the past four years to a level other 
industries took decades to reach, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, by an economics research center that described its  
results as ``highly conservative,'' found that electronic commerce 
-- the worldwide purchases across the Internet of books, automobiles 
and other goods and services from U.S. companies -- generated nearly 
$102 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining revenues came from companies that create hardware  
or software, support the Internet's infrastructure or act as 
intermediaries for digital transactions, such as online travel 
agents or brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which will be updated four times annually, was funded  
by Cisco Systems Inc., the $8.5 billion company in San Jose, 
Calif., that makes specialized computer hardware for the Internet. 
It was conducted by the Center for Research on Electronic Commerce 
at the University of Texas in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	The total Internet-related revenue of $301 billion is about 4  
percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest 
measure of economic health -- and electronic commerce is about 1.3 
percent of GDP. But Cisco's chairman, John Chambers, predicted 
dramatic growth will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet business, in today's times -- it's only in the second  
or third inning,'' Chambers said Thursday. ``Think about how long 
it took other industries to reach $300 billion. Literally, in under 
a decade, we've reached a level that it took other industries 100 
years to reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ethan Harris, deputy chief economist for Lehman Brothers, said  
the study's results were important because, despite anecdotal 
information about the Internet's tremendous impact on the economy, 
there exists what he called a ``data desert'' to quantify its 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to stand up here and say this is God's gift to  
the world,'' Harris said. But he also called the study ``a very 
good start'' and noted that gauging activity across the Internet 
was a difficult exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said it compiled the study's results by looking  
at 3,100 U.S. companies that generate all or part of their revenues 
from Internet products or services. Some of the information was 
compiled using reports from research companies, financial reports 
and the Web sites for 300 of the largest companies.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Amateur pianists -- among them a glass  
installer, a hair stylist, a retired school teacher and an 
anesthesiologist -- took the stage for a chance at playing in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Though none of the 32 performers is on a path to a musical  
career, the first International Piano Competition for Outstanding 
Amateurs gave them a chance to perform before a crowd of discerning 
classical music listeners and a dozen or so international jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition for 90 performers from nine countries runs  
through Sunday at Texas Christian University. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Scrimale bowed to the crowd of about 200 and smiled after  
he'd played the last chord. Scrimale said he was shocked that he 
wasn't more scared to be in the spotlight. Until now, the 
43-year-old assistant with a consulting company in Dallas had 
played only for small groups of friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a group of friends in the audience, and that helped,''  
he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition is sponsored by the Van Cliburn Foundation, the  
same organization that runs the prestigious Van Cliburn 
International Piano Competition every four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The amateur event is open only to those 30 or older who are not  
professional pianists or piano teachers. The main event usually 
includes pianists younger than 30 who are on the path of a musical 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The top prize at the amateur event is $2,000, regular seats at  
the main Van Cliburn competition and a chance to play with an 
orchestra in Paris sometime before 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges are generally music professors and piano performers.  
</P>
<P>
	Performers were given 10 minutes each to perform whatever they  
wanted for the preliminaries. Fewer than 18 performers will make it 
into the semifinals and finals, which will allow performers more 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlying it all is the chance that the event may introduce  
music buffs and piano gurus to an undiscovered talent -- someone 
like Jon Nakamatsu, the German teacher at a San Jose, Calif., high 
school who won the 1997 gold medal at the main Van Cliburn event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may find the greatest amateur pianist in the world here,''  
said Sevan Melikyan, a spokesman for the Van Cliburn foundation.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Troops Converge Near Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American ground troops converged on Kosovo's  
doorstep Thursday, poised with NATO allies for a mission fraught 
with dangers ranging from land mines to booby-trapped bridges and 
the possibility of sniper fire from stay-behind Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be difficult,'' Defense Secretary William  
Cohen said. ``I don't think anyone should minimize the hardship 
that's going to be involved.'' He and Army Gen. Henry Shelton, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined the peacekeepers' 
mission at a Pentagon news conference after NATO suspended its 
bombing campaign and the United Nations authorized a NATO-led 
peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face challenges and risks in bringing home the refugees and  
restoring stability,'' President Clinton said at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declined to say how long the peacekeepers might have to  
stay in Kosovo. Next door, in Bosnia, 6,000 American soldiers are 
on a peacekeeping mission now 4 1/2 years old and with no end in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should put a timetable on it,'' Clinton said  
of the Kosovo mission for the 7,000 U.S. troops in a 50,000-strong 
NATO-led force. ``We will define our objectives and proceed to 
implement them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marines and Army soldiers in the vanguard of the U.S.  
peacekeeping contingent began arriving Thursday in northern 
Macedonia, where thousands of other allied forces stood ready to 
begin their Kosovo mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. contingent, dubbed Task Force Falcon, is to be  
headquartered in the town of Gnjilane in southeastern Kosovo. They 
will operate with peacekeepers from other NATO countries and 
possibly Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the operation is likely to cost U.S. taxpayers $1.5  
billion to $2 billion a year, not counting the cost of returning 
the hundreds of warplanes and thousands of troops that the Pentagon 
has sent to the Balkans and elsewhere in Europe over the past few 
months to carry out airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the first peacekeepers  
could enter Kosovo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inevitable that some unpleasantries will greet them,''  
British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson told a news conference in Skopje, 
Macedonia. He is the overall commander of the NATO-led peackeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, citing reports that Serb forces are destroying villages  
and laying more land mines on their way out of Kosovo, said: 
``Regrettably, that is a practice perhaps pursued by those who are 
intent on laying as much waste as they can while they are on the 
way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and allied warplanes continued patrolling the skies over  
Kosovo, and the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, one of the 
mainstays of NATO's 11-week air campaign, remains on station in the 
Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to keep its firepower close by as we judge the  
reception and the level of risk that our forces encounter as they 
go into Kosovo,'' Navy Vice Adm. Daniel J. Murphy, commander of the 
U.S. 6th Fleet, said in a telephone interview from his command ship 
in the Adriatic, the USS Mount Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,900 Marines who offloaded from ships at a beach in  
northern Greece and headed overland into Macedonia on Thursday, are 
expected to be gathered at their staging area near Petrovec, 
Macedonia, by late Friday, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once there, the Marines will come under the command of Army  
Brig. Gen. John Craddock, an assistant commander of the 1st 
Infantry Division, which is contributing most of the troops for the 
mission. They will be heavily armed, to include tanks, Bradley 
armored troop carriers and a variety of artillery, multiple-launch 
rocket systems, attack helicopters and equipment to find and remove 
land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	The military-to-military agreement that Yugoslav and NATO  
generals signed on Wednesday calls for the withdrawing Serb troops 
to mark and clear minefields, booby traps and other obstacles on 
their way out of Kosovo, but Pentagon officials said they expected 
many of the hazards to be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord also says that by Friday, Yugoslav authorities are to  
provide to NATO ``detailed records, positions and descriptions of 
all mines, unexploded ordnance'' and other hazards to safe movement 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said a small number of  
Serb forces will be permitted to return to Kosovo to help locate 
land mines so that children will not have to be ``tethered to their 
homes'' for safety. She was in Germany for a meeting with foreign 
ministers of the Western powers and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The swift end to the Kosovo conflict left NATO with an enormous  
task in fashioning a peacekeeping plan that will actually move into 
Kosovo before many of the 40,000 Serb forces have left the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	It was barely a week ago that Washington was buzz with  
speculation that U.S. ground troops would have to enter Kosovo -- 
forcibly, as an invasion force, not a peacekeeping force. Then, 
with a swiftness that took NATO by surprise, Milosevic capitulated 
and the door to a peaceful settlement swung open.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Draft Customer Service Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's major airlines today decided  
against announcing a voluntary move that had been aimed at holding 
off more serious mandatory customer-rights directives from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Greenwald, head of United Airlines, and chairman of a  
trade group representing the country's biggest carriers, said the 
airlines had been ready to announce the plan but decided against it 
at the last moment for reasons he refused to explain. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised an announcement in the near future.  
</P>
<P>
	``The commitment of the airlines to improve customer service is  
real. After all, airline passengers are the heart of our 
business,'' Greenwald told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of the 12-point plan, a draft of which was obtained  
Wednesday by The Associated Press, would have committed airlines to 
meeting customers' essential needs during long, on-aircraft delays. 
That would include making ``every reasonable effort to provide 
food, water, restroom facilities and access to medical treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That commitment stemmed from New Year's travel delays in  
Detroit, when passengers stuck on snowbound planes were held for 
hours in view of the airport terminal, in some cases without access 
to food, water or functioning toilets. Complaints about such 
treatment prompted several bills in the House and Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One such bill would require airlines to pay passengers  
compensation when they are stranded for more than two hours. 
Another would give passengers 48 hours to cancel nonrefundable 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines, the focus for many of the New Year's  
complaints, also was criticized last week by the Transportation 
Department for its handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the nation's major airlines had been expected to  
announce the plan during a news conference with lawmakers on 
Capitol Hill, but that was postponed Wednesday when last-minute 
glitches arose. Reportedly one carrier balked at some of the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the  
trade group representing the airlines, said: ``Clearly there has 
been an outcry on this issue. Certainly Congress has been at the 
forefront of it. And we've been talking with members about it and 
ways to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides better treatment of stranded passengers, the airline  
plan would have publicly committed the airlines to several things 
that have been proposed by Congress and the Clinton administration, 
or which already are the law or are the current policies of some 
carriers. According to the draft, they included: 
</P>
<P>
	--Providing the lowest fare available on telephone reservation  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Notifying customers of known delays, cancellations and  
diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Return of checked baggage within 24 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the baggage liability limit from the current $1,250  
per bag. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowing reservations to be held or canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	--Providing prompt ticket refunds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing airline procedures for accommodating disabled  
passengers or minors traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing and disclosing policies for all passengers who are  
kept off a flight despite a confirmed reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing in advance aircraft seating plans, rules on  
frequent-flier redemptions and ticket cancellation policies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensuring flight partners provide comparable customer service.  
</P>
<P>
	--Assuring that all written complaints are answered within 60  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The service commitment said the plans would be completed by Dec.  
15 and fully implemented by June 15, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Northwest, Attendants Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines and its flight attendants  
announced a tentative agreement on a five-year contract today, 
averting a possible strike against the nation's fourth largest 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the agreement that our members sent us to negotiate,''  
said Billie Davenport, president of Teamsters Local 2000. ``We are 
proud to recommend it to our brothers and sisters for 
ratification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A timetable for the ratification vote by some 11,000 flight  
attendants was still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Steenland, Northwest executive vice president, said the  
tentative agreement represents the importance of the flight 
attendants to the Eagan-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the agreement will not be released until materials  
have been distributed to the union members, the two sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and union representatives had resumed talks Tuesday  
in Washington. Pay and retirement were the key issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants, who had been seeking a new contract for  
nearly three years, were seeking pay comparable to that at Delta 
Air Lines, whose flight attendants are considered the industry's 
best paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendants took pay cuts to help keep Northwest out of  
bankruptcy and were looking for raises and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendants had voted overwhelmingly last weekend to  
authorize a strike. On Wednesday, they held informational pickets

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- James Eugene ``Rosy'' McHargue, a prolific  
jazz clarinetist, saxophonist and singer, died Monday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	McHargue played with the bands of Benny Goodman and Kay Kyser.  
He recently performed for his 95th birthday at an event sponsored 
by the New Orleans Jazz Club of Southern California. President 
Clinton, who also plays the saxophone, sent McHargue a letter for 
the occasion.

	SALISBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Anne Sheafe Miller, the first patient  
saved by penicillin when it was considered an experimental drug, 
died Monday. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Miller made medical history in 1942 as she lay near death  
in New Haven Hospital. She suffered from a streptococcal infection, 
her temperature spiking to nearly 107. Treatment with sulfa drugs, 
surgery and blood transfusions all failed.

<HEADLINE> Court's Loitering Ruling Excerpted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision Thursday striking  
down a Chicago anti-loitering law aimed at preventing street gang 
members from congregating in public. 
</P>
<P>
	From Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion, which in part spoke for  
a majority and in part for three justices: 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Chicago City Council enacted the Gang Congregation  
Ordinance, which prohibits ``criminal street gang members'' from 
``loitering'' with one another or with other persons in any public 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission of the offense involves four predicates. First, the  
police officer must reasonably believe that at least one of the two 
or more persons present in a public place is a criminal street gang 
member. Second, the persons must be loitering, which the ordinance 
defines as remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose. 
Third, the officer must then order all of the persons to disperse 
and remove themselves from the area. Four, a person must disobey 
the officer's order. 
</P>
<P>
	If any person, whether a gang member or not, disobeys the  
officer's order, that person is guilty of violating the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	We conclude that the ordinance enacted by the city of Chicago is  
unconstitutionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal  
sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order, the 
loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to 
prohibit. If the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the 
dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	In any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or  
sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse 
unless their purpose is apparent. The mandatory language in the 
enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making 
any inquiry about their possible purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his  
father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an 
unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the 
ballpark; in either event, if their purpose is not apparent to a 
nearby police officer, she may -- indeed, she ``shall'' -- order them 
to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the definition of loitering in the Chicago ordinance  
not only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct, but also 
has the perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage much of 
the intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment ... the most 
harmful gang loitering is motivated either by an apparent purpose 
to publicize the gang's dominance of certain territory, thereby 
intimidating nonmembers, or by an equally apparent purpose to 
conceal ongoing commerce in illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	We must assume that the ordinance means what it says and that is  
has no application to loiterers whose purpose is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	We recognize the serious and difficult problems testified to by  
the citizens of Chicago that led to the enactment of this 
ordinance. We are mindful that the preservation of liberty depends 
in part on the maintenance of social order. However, in this 
instance the city has enacted an ordinance that affords too much 
discretion to the police and too little notice to citizens who wish 
to use the public streets. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From Justice Clarence Thomas' dissenting opinion:  
</P>
<P>
	By invalidating Chicago's ordinance, I fear that the court has  
unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to lives of terror and 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
	The human costs exacted by criminal street gangs are  
inestimable. In many of our nation's cities, gangs have virtually 
overtaken certain neighborhoods, contributing to the economic and 
social decline of these areas and causing fear and lifestyle 
changes among law-abiding residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our poorest and most  
vulnerable citizens with a terror that the court does not give 
sufficient consideration, often relegating them to the status of 
prisoners in their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the court focuses extensively on the rights of gang  
members and their companions. It can safely do so -- the people who 
will have to live with the consequences of today's opinion do not 
live in our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, the people who will suffer from our lofty pronouncements  
are people ... who have seen their neighborhoods literally 
destroyed by gangs and violence and drugs. They are good, decent 
people who must struggle to overcome their desperate situation, 
against all odds, in order to raise their families, earn a living 
and remain good citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	As one resident described, ``There is only about maybe 1 or 2  
percent of the people in the city causing these problems maybe, but 
it's keeping 98 percent of us in our houses and off the streets and 
afraid to shop.'' By focusing exclusively on the imagined rights of 
the 2 percent, the court today has denied our most vulnerable 
citizens the very thing that Justice Stevens elevates above all 
else -- the freedom of movement. And that is a shame.

<HEADLINE> Federal Appeals Court Judge Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Giles S. Rich, 95, the oldest active federal  
judge in the nation's history and an authority on intellectual 
property rights and patent law, died Wednesday of lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal  
Circuit, had served on the appellate bench since 1956. He became 
the nation's oldest active federal judge in March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While a patent lawyer, Rich played an instrumental role in the  
drafting of the Patent Act of 1952, which helped form the 
foundation of current patent law. Later, he was appointed to the 
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals by President Eisenhower. He 
also was one of 12 founding judges when that court was replaced by 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Rochester, N.Y., Rich graduated from Harvard College and  
Columbia Law School.

<HEADLINE> Macarchuk Named Stony Brook Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STONY BROOK, N.Y. (AP) -- When Stony Brook went searching for a  
basketball coach, Nick Macarchuk called to recommend his son, one 
of his assistants at Fordham. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the job of the head coach to try and help his assistants  
become head coaches, so I made a phone call,'' Macarchuk said. 
``But I was told only people with head coaching experience were 
going to be considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Stony Brook was zeroing in on Bob McKillop of  
Davidson. Eventually, though, McKillop turned down the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I made a second phone call, figuring maybe the  
game plan had changed,'' Macarchuk said. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Stony Brook athletic director Dick Laskowski  
asked the Fordham coach if he might be interested in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing led to another,'' Macarchuk said, ``and here I am.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Seawolves, moving up to Division I, signed Macarchuk, 57, to  
a 5-year contract Thursday. His son will come along as an 
assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk has been a head coach for 22 seasons, the last 12 at  
Fordham where his teams played in three different conferences and 
compiled a 161-192 record. Before coming to Fordham, he coached 10 
years at Canisius. His overall record is 310-320. 
</P>
<P>
	Stony Brook, playing as an independent while awaiting membership  
in a conference, has a national schedule including games against 
Boston College, St. John's, Seton Hall, Utah, SMU, Wichita State, 
Cleveland State and College of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	``No conference and a tough schedule have been pointed out as  
roadblocks,'' said Macarchuk, who succeeds Bernard Tomlin. ``I'm 
used to that. This program can't be as bad as what I inherited at 
Canisius and Fordham. I'm confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin's teams were 101-106 from 1991-99, including 0-7 in  
limited Division I play last season.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 67.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply lower today as a strong  
economic report from Japan increased fears that continued growth in 
the U.S. economy may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 67.76 at 10,622.53, extending a loss of 219 points over the 
previous two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 8.25 at 1,310.39, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 20.99 at 2,498.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government said the nation's gross domestic product  
grew 1.9 percent in the first three months of the year -- a larger 
increase than expected, and the first since the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That set off fears that Japanese demand for U.S. goods will  
swell, boosting the domestic economy even further and setting off 
inflationary pressure around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of inflation has prompted the Fed to say it might  
raise interest rates if it determines that higher rates would cool 
off runaway economic growth. Traders are closely watching economic 
reports and signals that could offer a clue to the Fed's next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, bank stocks like Chase Manhattan, down 1 1/4 to 72 9/16,  
were mostly lower. Higher interest rates can hurt bank profits as 
lending volume shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer fell sharply for a second straight day, losing 4 15/16 to  
100. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday restricted the 
use of its antibiotic Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 91.9 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.80 at 624.48, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.56 at 769.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.89 percent as  
investors anticipated the GDP report, which was released after the 
close of trading. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was 
down 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 was down 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> 'Tinseltown' Subway Line Opens Sat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Metro Rail Red Line -- the over-budget,  
headache-plagued second installment of the city's subway soap opera 
-- opens this weekend at the corner of Hollywood and Vine. 
</P>
<P>
	The subway station is pure Hollywood -- the ceiling is covered  
with empty film reels, fake palm trees rise to the roof and two 
silent-movie projectors are enshrined as historical artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months behind schedule, the 4.6-mile subway leg opens  
Saturday. It will create a 19-minute ``Downtown to Tinseltown'' 
line that runs from Union Station to Hollywood and Vine, 
Hollywood's most famous crossroads and now one of the city's 
seedier intersections. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the segment and a smaller addition: $1.74 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	It may be the most-ridiculed transportation project in Southern  
California since Howard Hughes rolled out the Spruce Goose. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year project was marked by $288 million in cost  
overruns, a federal lawsuit, a fired contractor and angry merchants 
who lost money because three blocks of Hollywood Boulevard were 
closed after a giant sinkhole opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The boulevard itself slipped, cracking sidewalks and forcing the  
removal of several stars from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Some shop 
owners left. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is hope the new route will help revitalize  
Hollywood Boulevard, where sidewalks have been repaired, the stars 
are back in place and a stage production of ``The Wizard of Oz'' is 
running at the Pantages Theater, across the street from the new 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	But will Angelenos get out of their cars?  
</P>
<P>
	``People in L.A. are spoiled,'' said David Balmas, 23. ``If my  
car breaks down, that's the only reason I'd use it. In this city, I 
don't think people want to use the subway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Metropolitan Transit Authority predicts the new line will  
more than double weekday boardings (a round-trip is two boardings) 
to about 80,000 by December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridership on the subway's first leg -- 6.5 miles running west  
from Union Station to the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and 
Western Avenue -- is estimated at 38,725 weekday boardings. 
</P>
<P>
	A third and final stretch will run from Vine Street to North  
Hollywood. Completion is expected by next year, bringing the total 
mileage of the subway system in America's second-largest city to a 
mere 17.4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, New York City's 722-mile subway system had more  
than a billion fares in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvador Mendez, who runs a taco stand steps from the new  
Hollywood station and managed to hang on despite the construction 
problems, said he doesn't expect many new customers from 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says it's good that it is coming, but I don't  
know,'' Mendez said. ``I don't know if people will ride it.''

<HEADLINE>  Trinidad Says Vegas Not Neutral Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Felix Trinidad wants more influence  
in the selection of judges for the welterweight unification fight 
against Oscar De La Hoya in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad and his managers also said they want to set aside 3,000  
of the 12,000 tickets for the Sept. 18 championship fight so fellow 
Puerto Ricans can help eliminate any hometown advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my people there,'' the International Boxing Federation  
champion said during a news conference Thursday. ``Every country 
wants to be able to support its champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's handlers say they are concerned because Bob Arum, De  
La Hoya's promoter, is based in Las Vegas and De La Hoya is from 
nearby southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight at the Mandalay Bay Hotel must be ``absolutely fair,''  
said Trinidad's manager and father, Felix Trinidad Sr., because it 
will be the biggest match since a disputed March 13 bout between 
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxing fans disgusted by accusations of misconduct by judges in  
the Holyfield-Lewis fight won't pay the $49 pay-per-view fee if 
there are doubts about the fairness, Trinidad Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Nevada Athletic Commission chairman Elias Ghanem  
has invited both fighters to review lists of possible judges and 
referees and offer suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that the fight will be fair and that  
Trinidad will have input into selection of the officials,'' he said 
during a conference call Thursday. ``The fight will go on without 
mistakes and without any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya last fought in Las Vegas on May 22, stopping Oba Carr  
in the 11th round. The city will likely be the site for a 
Holyfield-Lewis rematch in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will probably choose one judge from the World  
Boxing Council and one from the International Boxing Federation, 
with a third judge from Nevada, Ghanem said. De La Hoya holds the 
WBC belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure the judges that they won't have to do much work,  
since I'm going to win by a knockout,'' Trinidad said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has agreed to fight for a $10.5 million purse -- of which $2  
million will go to promoter Don King -- in addition to $4 for every 
pay-per-view customer over 800,000. De La Hoya will get at least 
$15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, who easily stopped Colombian Hugo Pineda before a  
hometown crowd in San Juan on May 29, wants a substantial 
delegation of fans to counter his image as the lesser-known 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Puerto Ricans to witness De La Hoya's death,''  
Trinidad Sr. joked during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum, however, controls sales of most of the tickets through his  
Top Rank Boxing. A Top Rank spokesman could not immediately be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's Secretary of Sports and Recreation, Eric Labrador,  
said he will write letters to Arum and Nevada boxing officials 
urging that some tickets be set aside when sales begin Wednesday. 
Ticket prices will range from $300 to $1,500, according to Top 
Rank. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is undefeated in 35 fights with 30 knockouts and has  
long sought a fight with De La Hoya, considered the world's top 
welterweight with a 31-0 record and 22 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters begin a tour of American cities next week to  
publicize the bout.

<HEADLINE> Antimissile Missile Hits Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- An expensive experimental  
antimissile missile did today what it had been unable to do on six 
previous attempts -- hit a flying target. 
</P>
<P>
	A white puff of smoke and a squiggly white trail of vapor in the  
southern New Mexico sky marked where the Army's Theater 
High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile struck a target 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can put it in four letters -- B-A-N-G,'' said Bob  
Hunt, spokesman for the Army's program executive office for air and 
missile defense in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a voice mail message from White Sands, and there was a  
lot of ecstatic noise in the background,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, which cost $12 million, was to have taken place  
Tuesday, but a power failure the previous night at the Army's 
restricted missile range in southern New Mexico caused a 
postponement until today. 
</P>
<P>
	The last previous THAAD test at White Sands was scrubbed May 25  
when the target, a modified Minuteman 2 missile called a Hera, 
malfunctioned after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's test, the target lifted off at 5:09 a.m. MDT from a  
ranch site the Army rented north of the missile range. 
</P>
<P>
	The THAAD then lifted off 120 miles to the south from White  
Sands and struck the target seven minutes later over the range, 
leaving a burst of debris in the clear sky, said Jim Eckles, a 
White Sands spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The test's aerial display was seen as far west as Phoenix.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' said Lee Phares, a waitress in Las Cruces,  
west of the missile range. ``It was curved and it was pretty. I 
kept looking back at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test was the seventh in a planned series of 13 flight tests,  
Hunt said. The first three tests were not intercept attempts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD is supposed to shield American troops in the field by  
intercepting and destroying enemy missiles from ranges of 800 miles 
away or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say its technology is working fine and blame the  
problems on the weapon's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin. Critics 
say the $3.8 billion system is too expensive and unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed was fined $15 million after THAAD's sixth failure to  
hit its target on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	If THAAD cannot make a second successful intercept by July 16,  
in addition today's test, Lockheed will owe an extra $20 million in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous deadline, June 30, was extended because of the May  
25 problem with the target missile.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Debut Might Draw Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A few years ago, professional women's  
basketball routinely was played in front of a few scattered fans 
and thousands of empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport has come a long way fast. On Thursday night, the  
WNBA's Washington Mystics not only expect to draw a sellout crowd 
of more than 20,000 for their season opener against the Charlotte 
Sting -- they'll be disappointed if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts will be going 'thump, thump,' '' said center  
Shalonda Enis, who thought 3,000 was a good turnout when she was 
playing the last 2 1/2 years for the ABL's Seattle Reign. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to say the throngs are coming out to see No. 1 overall  
draft pick Chamique Holdsclaw make the most anticipated pro debut 
in women's basketball history, but the Mystics would probably have 
filled the MCI Center even if they didn't have the so-called female 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, despite a 3-27 record, the team averaged 15,910 fans  
and had two sellouts of 20,674 -- the largest crowds ever to watch a 
women's pro basketball game in the United States. The WNBA, only 
three years old, is healthy enough to make plans for four expansion 
teams next season. 
</P>
<P>
	For coach Nancy Darsch, it's the arrival of the big time  
happening before her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential was there,'' Darsch said. ``We've seen  
it in the college game at many different programs around the 
country. We saw in Atlanta in 1996 at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think there certainly still was some question as to  
'Who's going to come to the MCI Center in July? Who's going to go 
to Madison Square Garden in July?' The fans have certainly answered 
that with an exclamation point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Rhonda Blades, who has played with Detroit and New York in  
the WNBA, realizes she arrived at just the right time. Although 
released by the Mystics on Wednesday, Blades should have no 
shortage of opportunities to extend her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It don't really consider myself a pioneer, but in this league  
I've been there since the beginning,'' Blades said. ``It's 
wonderful not only for women's basketball, but for women's sports 
and women in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become the thing to do. You've got people like Chamique  
that come out and put their stamp on women's basketball. She 
appeals to a different crowd than even Rebecca Lobo did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the hype surrounding her, Holdsclaw has kept an even  
keel during the Mystics camp. The two-time player of the year from 
Tennessee realizes her game may be notch above the rest, but she's 
also tried to play expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to say something about herself at the Mystics luncheon on  
Tuesday, Holdsclaw stood and said: ``I'm from Tennessee. I'm a 
rookie.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia Energy Rejects Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group's board of directors  
voted unanimously Thursday to reject a hostile $5.7 billion buyout 
offer from NiSource Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But a NiSource spokeswoman said the Indiana-based natural gas  
supplier wouldn't immediately abandon its bid, saying the company 
would assess all of its options before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed but not surprised, because this is an  
example of entrenched management refusing to hear their 
shareholders,'' said NiSource spokeswoman Maria Hibbs. ``Columbia 
has sophisticated shareholders who understand the value of their 
investment and they told us clearly they wanted management to meet 
with NiSource.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy's decision underscored the company's position  
that it isn't for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to NiSource chairman and chief executive Gary Neale,  
Columbia Energy chairman, president and CEO Oliver G. Richard III 
said his board concluded that NiSource's offer wasn't in the best 
interests of Columbia Energy and its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors that influenced Columbia Energy was an opinion  
from investment bankers Salomon Smith Barney ``that the proposed 
consideration is inadequate,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your proposal threatens to deprive Columbia shareholders of  
the substantial value that Columbia's existing strategic plan will 
create,'' Richard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard said Columbia Energy's board was committed to preventing  
another company from taking advantage of a ``current anomaly'' in 
which the Virginia company's stock value doesn't reflect its true 
earnings potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy's shares closed Thursday up 18 3/4 cents to $62 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Merrillville, Ind.-based NiSource made an unsolicited  
bid of $68 cash for each share in Columbia Energy. The proposed 
buyout would have made NiSource, the parent company of Northern 
Indiana Public Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts, 
one of the nation's biggest natural gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon, Va., had 1998 revenue of  
nearly $6.6 billion. It is involved in natural gas exploration, 
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Columbia Energy attempted to buy Pittsburgh-based  
Consolidated Natural Gas. But CNG last month rejected the offer to 
proceed with an already-planned merger with Richmond-based Dominion 
Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Neale had said he hoped shareholder pressure within Columbia  
Energy would force its board to negotiate. At least three 
class-action shareholder lawsuits were filed to get talks going, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Share of NiSource closed down 6 1/4 cents Thursday on the NYSE at  
$27.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks gained on Friday, spurred by the  
announcement a day before that Japan's economy posted robust growth 
in the first quarter of the year. The U.S. dollar was lower against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 237.75  
points, or 1.39 percent, to 17,340.36 at the end of the morning 
session. On Thursday, the average closed up 480.12 points, or 2.89 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 19.78 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,387.39 
points. The TOPIX was up 25.10 points, or 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong stock performance followed the Economic Planning  
Agency's announcement Thursday that the nation's economy grew 1.9 
percent, or 7.9 percent on an annualized basis, in the first 
quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers marked Japan's first expansion after five quarters  
of contraction. The country is struggling with its deepest 
recession since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was lower against the yen  
as traders scrutinized the previous day's surprise market 
intervention by Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.68 yen at late morning, down 0.44 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and its late New York level of 118.84 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders said they were assessing what the yen-selling  
action by the Bank of Japan on Thursday afternoon will mean for the 
market's mid-term direction. The intervention followed the 
announcement of new GDP figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials recently have expressed dissatisfaction with  
dollar-yen volatility. The greenback was worth more than 122 yen at 
the beginning of this month, but then dropped as low as 117.63 yen 
after the release of the economic data Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a market estimate, the Bank of Japan spent about $1  
billion in the intervention Thursday, the Nihon Keizai newspaper 
said. The central bank last intervened on Jan. 12 in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies Friday, the euro was traded at 124.62 yen,  
down from 125.11 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond rose to  
1.6800 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.5900 percent, driving 
its price down to 97.60 yen from 98.36 yen.

<HEADLINE> Heineken Buys Stake in Brewery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dutch beer company Heineken NV has agreed to pay  
$919 million in cash for Diageo PLC's majority stake in Spain's 
biggest brewery. 
</P>
<P>
	The British food and drinks conglomerate said Thursday that it  
will earn a profit of $105 million on the sale of its 88 percent 
share in Cruzcampo SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruzcampo accounts for a quarter of all beer sold in Spain, the  
third-largest beer market in the European Union. Heineken already 
owns a majority stake in that country's No. 3 brewer, El Aguila. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale requires approval by the European Commission, but  
Diageo spokeswoman Kathryn Partridge said the companies expected to 
satisfy regulatory requirements within eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Diageo had received several unsolicited expressions of interest  
in Cruzcampo, said Colin Storm, chief executive of Guinness, 
Diageo's brewing division. 
</P>
<P>
	By selling Cruzcampo, Diageo further streamlines its product  
range to focus on better-selling brands like Guinness Stout and the 
Johnnie Walker and J&AMP;B Scotch whisky labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Diageo also owns the Pillsbury, Haagen-Dazs and Burger King  
brands. It was formed by the merger of Grand Metropolitan and 
Guinness in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Amsterdam-based Heineken is the world's second-largest brewer  
after Anheuser-Busch Inc. of the United States.

<HEADLINE>  14 Pct. of Indonesia Votes Counted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police bolstered security around  
Jakarta today as a slow election vote count fed anxiety that 
Indonesia's long tradition of vote-rigging was again plaguing the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Election officials denied any improprieties, saying they have  
been swamped by the 113 million votes cast in Monday's 
parliamentary election, billed as the country's most democratic 
vote in 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Unofficial results released to journalists showed that just 14  
percent of the votes had been tabulated by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Local authorities had been given the right to redo the voting in  
some provinces where there had been complaints about 
irregularities, said Rudini, head of the General Elections 
Commission. Rudini, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle, headed by  
opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, maintained its lead with 
35 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Golkar Party, which languished in pre-election  
opinion polls, moved into second place with just under 21 percent. 
The National Awakening Party of Abdurrahman Wahid, head of 
Indonesia's largest Islamic group, was third with 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 48 parties fielded candidates.  
</P>
<P>
	International observers, including former President Carter, said  
lingering delays could erase public trust in Indonesia's fledgling 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Television stations ran public-service advertisements to explain  
the count and the reasons for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevent unrest, police shifted security forces to potential  
rallying points in the capital, including the General Elections 
Commission headquarters and the Hotel Aryaduta, where the votes are 
being tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope parties could restrain themselves from going to the  
streets to celebrate victory or to protest results,'' said Jakarta 
police spokesman Lt. Col. Zairuni Lubis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank Valentino of the Washington-based International Foundation  
for Election Systems, which has been helping in the election, said 
today he believed from the start it would take at least a week to 
tabulate the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because fishy things happened in the past doesn't mean  
they're happening now,'' Valentino said. ``It's different this 
time. In the past, they knew the results before the election 
started. Now they're taking the time to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudini said he could not predict when a final result would be  
available. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the delays on slow and meticulous work by workers  
processing ballots in tens of thousands of villages. The delays 
were inevitable, he said, because the election was set up in three 
months, compared with three years in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in Indonesia are impatient because this is the  
first time that we implemented a general election like this -- more 
democratic, more open and more fair,'' said Rudini, who uses only 
one name like many Indonesians. 
</P>
<P>
	The election for 462 seats in Parliament was the first step  
toward selecting a president. The new legislators will join 38 
representatives of the powerful military and 200 government 
appointees to choose a head of state in five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesians last voted in a free election in 1955. Monday's  
ballot was held a year after student protests and deadly riots 
forced authoritarian President Suharto to quit after 32 years in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	During Suharto's era, elections were tightly controlled and his  
Golkar Party always won landslide victories, largely through 
vote-rigging and buying.

<HEADLINE> Russia Moves To Limit Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's lower house of parliament on Thursday  
gave tentative approval to a bill that would restrict cigarette 
smoking in one of the world's more smoker-friendly nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which the State Duma approved in the first reading by  
a 297-43 vote, would ban selling cigarettes to people under 18 and 
limit tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also ban people from smoking at their workplaces, in  
sports facilities, schools and universities, theaters, hospitals 
and government organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	As of now, smoking in Russia is only prohibited on public  
transportation, and the country has few effective controls on 
cigarette advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 percent of Russians smoke. According to official  
statistics released last month, 74 percent of men aged 30 to 35 are 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has one of the world's highest smoking rates, which  
doctors cite as a reason for Russians' low life expectancy: The 
average man dies before his 60th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would have to undergo another two readings before it's  
passed by the Duma. It must also be approved by the upper house of 
parliament, the Federation Council, and President Boris Yeltsin to 
become law.

<HEADLINE> NCAA May Bar Freshmen Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Should male basketball players be  
ineligible their freshman year? 
</P>
<P>
	Should the NCAA reward schools with high graduation rates by  
giving them extra basketball scholarships? And penalize schools 
with low rates by taking scholarships away? 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing will happen soon. But those controversial ideas are  
being considered by a special committee studying the problems of 
Division I men's basketball and could become NCAA law if approved 
by the policy-making board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is mixed sentiment among members of the  
working group on freshman eligibility,'' NCAA president Cedric 
Dempsey said. ``I would say there has been a growing interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several different options being looked at. I'm not  
sure which ones will surface at this point. But one concept is 
letting the entry-level student-athletes, including transfer 
students and international students, sit out a year and concentrate 
on their academics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany conducted his own study of  
Division I basketball and announced possible solutions to such 
issues as low graduation rates, gambling, agents and recruiting 
problems, the NCAA appointed a special 27-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, the NCAA was talking about a marketing study,''  
Delany said. ``I didn't think marketing was our problem, and I told 
them that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, whose chairman is Syracuse president Buzz Shaw,  
is expected to make formal recommendations in late July. They would 
be passed on to the NCAA management council, and from there go to 
the board of directors. The board might not act until October 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal applies only to men's basketball. USA Today, which  
first reported the proposal Wednesday, initially said it would also 
apply to women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is not considering ending freshmen eligibility for  
any other sport, including women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Delany is not certain the NCAA presidents would be willing to  
make men's basketball players ineligible as freshmen while letting 
all other athletes, including female basketball players, compete in 
their first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the answer to that,'' Delany told The Associated  
Press. ``But they should have the opportunity. I hope this 
committee is bold and does what it thinks is right for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freshmen have been eligible since 1972.  
</P>
<P>
	If the NCAA bars freshmen competition among men's basketball  
players, a court challenge would almost surely follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a judge would listen to different treatment for men's  
basketball if you could demonstrate with data how unhealthy 
Division I men's basketball really is,'' said Delany, a former 
chairman of the NCAA's tournament selection committee. ``You would 
need to have rationale for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delany conceded that barring freshmen males from basketball  
could encourage them to jump from high school to the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to me, that should not be a primary consideration,'' he  
said. ``Those players are not going to be (in school) very long 
anyway. At the end of the day, that's not an NCAA problem. That's a 
problem for the NBA players association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another possibly controversial move, the group is thinking  
about asking the board of directors to tie scholarship limits to 
graduation rates. Schools with low graduation rates in men's 
basketball would have fewer scholarships to offer than those with 
higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would want to be sure that schools are not penalized when  
student-athletes leave school in good academic standing,'' Dempsey 
said. ``We wanted people to use their imaginations, and they 
certainly are doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Males would be singled out for freshmen ineligibility because of  
their consistently low graduation rates. According to the NCAA's 
latest statistics, only 41 percent of male basketball players in 
the 1991 entering class got their degrees, including just 37 
percent of black players. That was the lowest of all groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The graduation rate for all Division I athletes was 57 percent.  
The rate for female basketball players, 66 percent, was the 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the general feeling is that the women  
student-athletes are not faced with the same kinds of issues that 
many of the male student-athletes are faced with,'' Dempsey said.

<HEADLINE> Outrage Over Sex Abuse Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The American Psychological Association will  
weigh the potential consequences of publishing research after 
criticism of a study that concluded the long-term effects of child 
sexual abuse are not as serious as many believe. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which concluded that scientists should classify sex  
between adults and children depending on the ``willingness'' and 
age of the child, was published last July in the APA's 
Psychological Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	It has become the target of groups such as the Christian  
Coalition and the Family Research Council, which said it plans to 
disrupt the APA's annual meeting in August in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the study could be used to legitimize pedophilia.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've never, ever had a reaction like this,'' said Raymond  
Fowler, chief executive officer of the Washington-based 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The APA, which has been publishing journals for 106 years, said  
it will now consider the ``social policy implications'' of research 
it publishes. It represents 159,000 clinicians, researchers and 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
	The study -- a review of 59 other studies involving college  
students who had been sexually abused before the age of 18 -- 
concluded that lasting negative effects from the abuse were 
uncommon for men and present in only a minority of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Child sexual abuse ``does not cause intense harm on a pervasive  
basis regardless of gender in the college population,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-author Robert Bauserman, an AIDS prevention researcher in  
Maryland, said the article was written for scientists and he never 
expected it to be discussed in the popular media. Another author, 
Temple University psychology professor Bruce Rind, said researchers 
were trying to strike a balance between the total neglect of child 
abuse before 1970 and what they saw as exaggeration of the problem 
after 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler said the APA should have given more thought to how the  
study would be received. It could have been presented with an 
introduction outlining the APA's stance against child abuse or 
paired with an article with a different viewpoint.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Faces N.Y. Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The morning after she faced protesters  
with ``carpetbagger go home'' signs, could-be Senate candidate 
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today she hasn't yet secured a New York 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going around collecting offers of people's guest rooms and  
extra beds and pull-out couches,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady -- on her 11th trip to New York and her first  
since she announced she would form an exploratory committee to pay 
for early campaign forays -- denied news reports that she's buying 
or leasing a home in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard so many stories about apartments and houses that  
I've bought and I only wish that were true, but that hasn't 
happened yet,'' Mrs. Clinton told NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked whether she was bound to make the race now that  
Rep. Nita Lowey, the only other Democrat publicly mulling a run for 
the Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
has bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a Democrat will win this Senate race and I'm looking  
forward to going out and listening to New Yorkers and just having a 
good time, to be honest,'' Mrs. Clinton replied. On the stops she 
made here and in New York City Wednesday, she said, ``I learned a 
lot, I saw a lot of people and I had a great experience and I'm 
going to be doing a lot of that in July and August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She took a jab at Republicans, saying the way they've handled  
gun control legislation this week only proves that the Democratic 
Party ``is much more in touch with the mainstream -- not only of 
America, but particularly of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about three dozen demonstrators shouting from across the  
street outside a Lockheed Martin plant she had visited near 
Binghamton, Mrs. Clinton told reporters Wednesday that such 
protests were simply a ``fact of political life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, born in Illinois and a former first lady of  
Arkansas, has never lived or worked in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the plant, she told about 40 employees, handpicked by  
company officials for a discussion with Mrs. Clinton about job 
creation and other economic issues, that the nation has been so 
successful ``because of people who have been willing to try new 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many people locked into old thinking. ... We are  
all such prisoners of our past,'' the first lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the subject of Mrs. Clinton's possible candidacy never  
came up during the almost hourlong question-and-answer session with 
the plant employees, it did demonstrate a lacking in her high-tech 
expertise. When one worker asked her why the federal government 
wasn't doing more to advance mag lev technology, she responded, 
``Could you tell me what that technology is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mag lev, short for magnetic levitation, can be used to reduce  
the friction of rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate race could pit Mrs. Clinton against Republican New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who formed an exploratory committee in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's latest New York foray continued Wednesday  
evening with a fund-raiser for Rep. Maurice Hinchey at a Binghamton 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	While about 300 people attended the fund-raiser for the  
Democratic congressman, a dozen or so protesters were outside and 
office building windows overlooking the hotel were adorned with 
several anti-Clinton signs. One read: ``Hillary Clinton is not 
qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton then flew to New York City for a $5,000-a-person  
dinner organized by financial writer Andrew Tobias at a private 
home. The event, aimed at gay and lesbian campaign contributors, 
was expected to raise at least $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> FastShip Develops Speedy Freighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Plans for a fleet of jet-powered, oceangoing  
cargo ships moved a step closer to fruition with an agreement 
Thursday for the construction of the first four vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	FastShip Inc. hopes to begin service between Philadelphia and  
Cherbourg, France, in 2003, with ships that cross the ocean at up 
to 38 knots, or almost 44 mph, more than twice as fast as 
conventional freighters. 
</P>
<P>
	FastShip announced a preliminary agreement with National Steel  
and Shipbuilding Co., and talks are under way on the construction 
of up to five additional high-speed vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, FastShip, which has yet to transport any goods since its  
formation in 1994, will have to raise about $1 billion to foot the 
bill. It earlier hired J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. of New York to 
help raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will compete closely to air freights,'' said Roland K.  
Bullard II, the president of Philadelphia-based FastShip. ``We 
represent a whole new mode and choice for the consumer. We all know 
the premium is on speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard said the ship should be able to turn today's standard  
14-21 day trans-Atlantic crossing for cargo into a seven-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
	FastShip will target as customers makers of ``high-end,  
time-sensitive'' products such as computer chips, auto parts and 
perishable farm products at transportation costs as much as 75 
percent less than rates for air freight, spokesman Thomas Beck 
said. The company's rates have not been set yet, but are expected 
to be closer to conventional sea cargo rates than to air rates. 
</P>
<P>
	That could lower prices on goods such as computers, for example.  
Microchips would get to their destination faster for assembly into 
computers in a highly competitive industry, allowing companies to 
produce them faster, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime we introduce more competition, it would be welcome.  
There will be more opportunities to serve shippers in a faster 
manner,'' said Robert Voltmann, of the Transportation 
Intermediaries Association in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a continuance of a trend more in international trade,''  
he added. ``The faster you move a product, the more you can reduce 
inventory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ships will be able to power through the Atlantic's rough  
seas using five modified jet aircraft engines powering water jets 
instead of the conventional propellers, Bullard said. A patented 
hull shape also helps speed up the journey. 
</P>
<P>
	During the roughest conditions, conventional ships must slow  
down to about 14 to 20 knots to safely cross between North America 
and Europe. FastShip's fleet will be smaller than the average 
conventional cargo ship, but will be able to do twice as many runs, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving in a different direction from the megaship,''  
Beck said. ``We are not competing on costs, we will compete on 
service. We will be fast, frequent and reliable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullard called Philadelphia the ideal North American hub for his  
service because 60 percent of the U.S. gross national product is 
generated within 350 miles of the city's port -- less than a day's 
journey by truck or rail. 
</P>
<P>
	The FastShip technology was developed partly using a $7 million  
investment by the Delaware River Port Authority. The authority has 
also promised to finance a new waterfront terminal for FastShip, 
which could cost up to $74.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to forging a long-term relationship ... that  
combines our shipbuilding expertise with FastShip's technology and 
patents,'' NASSCO president Richard H. Voltman said.

<HEADLINE> McGovern, Neuharth Cross Home State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OACOMA, S.D. (AP) -- Former Sen. George McGovern felt right at  
home when he stopped for lunch at a cafe during a drive across 
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done that a thousand times,'' the 1972 presidential  
candidate said of the small town meeting-and-greeting. 
</P>
<P>
	McGovern's nostalgic visit to Main Street came during a two-day  
trip with longtime writer and news executive Al Neuharth, the 
former chairman of Gannett Co. Inc., who also grew up in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsman and the newsmaker reminisced about old times and old  
friends as they rode in a bus outfitted with easy chairs, 
telephones and televisions. After leaving Rapid City, they visited 
the Badlands, a wild horse ranch and the Missouri River. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was part of NewsCapade, a traveling version of the  
Newseum in Arlington, Va., that is designed to give people a better 
understanding of the news media. The exhibit will visit all 50 
states in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuharth, who has known McGovern for more than 40 years, invited  
the former Democratic senator to ride with him on the South Dakota 
leg of the tour. The state remains a touchstone for both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuharth said he drives through South Dakota twice a year, in  
the spring and fall, to get a sense of what people are doing and 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	McGovern, who is now U.S. representative to the United Nations  
Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, said he visits the state 
at least four times a year. He expects to return more often because 
Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, where McGovern once taught, 
is planning to build a library in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been almost 20 years since I've toured the state, and  
this was an opportunity to do it with somebody else driving,'' 
McGovern said. ``It's nice to be able to come back and look at it 
under more relaxed circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Accuses Bank of Selling Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A large bank denied wrongdoing as it  
admitted to sharing private information on a million customers with 
a telemarketer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Mike  
Hatch contends U.S. Bank illegally sold the data to Member Works 
Inc. of Stamford, Conn., for $4 million, violating the federal Fair 
Credit Reporting Act and engaging in consumer fraud and deceptive 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch asked the court to prohibit the bank from exchanging  
customers' personal information and to make the bank pay civil 
penalties to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Information sold by the bank included customer names, Social  
Security numbers, birth dates, credit limits, marital status, 
occupation and home ownership status, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Member Works said it used the data to sell services such as  
memberships in a medical discount program. The bank also illegally 
allowed Member Works to automatically withdraw payments from 
checking accounts without written customer authorization, Hatch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp, parent company of U.S. Bank, denied the  
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our direct marketing program is very carefully managed. Our  
partners at no time have access to customer accounts,'' said Donn 
Waage, a spokesman for the nation's 13th-largest bank holding 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70,000 bank customers have purchased products through  
Member Works, Waage said. ``When customers agree to purchase a 
product, their approval is voice-recorded with their permission,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of Member Works did not return a call for  
comment Wednesday. Hatch said a lawsuit also could be filed against 
Member Works. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said 1 million people were affected in 17 states:  
California, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, 
Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, 
Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> House Faces Votes on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House is facing a series of votes on the  
future U.S. presence in Kosovo, even as members of both parties 
applaud a new peace accord that will allow American peacekeepers 
into the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the House today is debate on a provision that would place  
restrictions on the use of U.S. funds for either a military or a 
peacekeeping presence beyond Sept. 30, the end of the present 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans are trying to strike that  
provision from a $288.8 billion defense authorization bill, 
particularly in light of Wednesday's agreement under which Serb 
forces are being withdrawn from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., praised the peace  
agreement and the U.S. forces in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the people of Yugoslavia see this as an opportunity to  
replace their leadership, especially Mr. Milosevic,'' Hastert said 
in reference to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans are pressing for a legislative demand  
that no U.S. funds be used for rebuilding Serbia, outside of the 
province of Kosovo, as long as Milosevic remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled House voted late Wednesday  
to end another U.S. peacekeeping force -- the one that has been in 
Haiti since March 1995. The House voted 227-198 to pull the 
permanent force out of the Caribbean nation by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops have been fired on in Haiti. ... Things have gone  
sour in Haiti,'' said Sen. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee and the sponsor of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to leave our troops in Haiti in an open-ended  
deployment,'' agreed Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a permanent force, the measure would allow  
``periodic, noncontinuous'' troop deployments there. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents complained that the peacekeeping force in Haiti  
numbered fewer than 500 troops. ``Haiti does not have an army now 
because they agreed to get rid of it,'' said Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich. ``Our troops are not in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House also rejected, as it has done in past years, a  
proposal to liberalize the ban on abortions at military hospitals 
overseas. It turned back, 225-203, a proposal to allow the 
procedures if the woman paid for it with her own funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is expected to wrap up work on the defense bill today.  
</P>
<P>
	The provision in the bill to restrict Kosovo funds would ``pull  
defeat from victory,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior 
Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House broke into bipartisan applause when Skelton announced  
Wednesday afternoon that a peace accord had been signed in 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the provision Skelton and other Democrats want to  
defeat would prohibit U.S. funds from being used for either combat 
or peacekeeping operations in any part of Yugoslavia beyond Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	If the president wanted to continue such operations, however, he  
could cite national security grounds and submit separate 
legislation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services panel,  
expressed continued support for the provision -- but agreed the 
peace agreement might change some votes on it and other 
Kosovo-related measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The restriction was approved last month by Spence's committee.  
Skelton is leading the effort to strike it from the bill, claiming 
it's an embarrassment in light of the peace announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was also expected to take up a proposal by Rep. Tillie  
Fowler, R-Fla., that would require the president to get express 
prior approval from Congress before sending any forces to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted 428-0 for a package of amendments  
from members of a House committee that last month concluded China 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets over a 20-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	The package beefs up counterintelligence programs at the Energy  
Department, requires polygraph tests of employees at national 
laboratories, restricts lab visits by foreigners and requires a 
barrage of new reports to Congress on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	------

	The bill is H.R. 1401

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports on Summer Heat Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An average of 381 people a year died of the heat  
in the United States between 1979 and 1996, the government reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the heat  
killed 6,864 people during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths included children locked in sweltering cars and  
elderly people without air conditioning. About half of all the 
heat-related deaths were people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat-related illnesses can be prevented by drinking lots of  
water, finding some air conditioning and limiting exercise to the 
cooler parts of the day, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, 90-plus temperatures in the East caused at  
least one death, that a 62-year-old man found dead in his 
Pottstown, Pa., apartment.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Delays Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sensitive to Israeli political tensions, first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton today canceled a Middle East trip that 
had been scheduled for this month. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior State Department official said the department advised  
Mrs. Clinton against the trip after it became clear that Israeli 
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak would need longer than expected to 
form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who commented only on condition of anonymity, said  
the advice to Mrs. Clinton was not a sign the United States had 
lost confidence that Barak could form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's tour, scheduled at the end of President Clinton's  
trip to the G-8 summit in Germany, was to include stops in Israel, 
Jordan and Yemen for the ``Emerging Democracy Conference'' there, 
and meetings with the Palestinian Authority. The first lady's 
office said the trip would be rescheduled but offered no details or 
explanation, referring all inquiries to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will still travel through Europe next week with her  
husband, and will additionally keep a date to address an education 
conference in Sicily, Italy, on June 18, spokeswoman Toby Graff 
said.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco To Sell Canada Oil Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC is putting its conventional  
and heavy oil properties in Canada up for sale so the company can 
focus on its Canadian gas and petrochemicals businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The global oil company said Thursday the properties represent  
about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, nearly a third of its 
total Canadian production. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will affect the jobs of about 250 employees in the  
field and at the Calgary head office of its Canadian subsidiary, BP 
Amoco Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to be the lowest cost producer in Canada in our  
natural gas, natural gas liquids and chemicals operations,'' said 
Joseph Bryant, regional president of BP Amoco in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has been moving to cut costs and streamline operations  
since British Petroleum bought Chicago-based Amoco Corp. last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Amoco Canada recently cut 275 jobs, mostly at its Calgary head  
office, because of low world oil prices. The cuts left Amoco Canada 
with about 1,800 employees in the production of conventional and 
heavy oil, natural gas and petrochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said it expects to receive bids and complete  
transactions for its Canadian oil properties throughout the third 
and fourth quarters this year. While it will try to sell the 
properties individually, the company said it will consider bigger 
offers for all the properties.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Panel Denies Firings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The head of Sydney's Olympic Games  
organizing committee denied media reports Friday that some Olympic 
staff had been fired due to cost-cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sydney radio report Friday said morale within SOCOG was at an  
``all-time low'' with the torch relay committee, community 
relations group and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
program reported to be hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reports that there are sackings in SOCOG are incorrect,''  
chief executive Sandy Hollway said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the organization absorbs the budget cuts recently approved  
by the SOCOG board it is inevitable that there will need to be a 
reassignment of resources from some parts of the organization to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only 22 staff (out of a total of nearly 1,000) will need to be  
reassigned to other programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway said he had given reassurances that SOCOG staff who were  
reassigned should not fear for their jobs, and instead the 
organization intends to double its staff between now and September 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG is scheduled to take on another 1,000 people between now  
and the Games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff who are being reassigned are people SOCOG wants to  
keep. We can't afford to lose good people.''

<HEADLINE> Women's College Study Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If women don't attend college it's usually  
because they can't. Debt, children, age and anxiety keep them away. 
</P>
<P>
	But men who go straight from high school into the work force  
tend to do so because they were ``never that interested'' in 
college, according to a study released today by the American 
Association of University Women. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1,070 respondents to the group's national telephone  
survey, women were more likely than men not to attend college 
because of their credit-card debt or lack of scholarships and other 
college aid. Other barriers to college cited in the study were the 
need to care for children and lack of support from spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers call the results evidence of the newest career track  
metaphor: ``the spiral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The spiral captures the likelihood that women will move in and  
out of formal education ... by choice or necessity,'' said AAUW 
President Maggie Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The respondents, questioned in December 1998 and January 1999,  
represented three groups: high school to work, high school to 
college, and work to college. The margin of error is plus or minus 
5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Women already in the work force were also six times more likely  
than their male counterparts to think they were too old (18 percent 
of women to 3 percent of men), even though over half of current 
first-time college enrollees are over 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Men, unlike women, the researchers said, based their decisions  
more on choice than need. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the respondents who went from high school to work, 85 percent  
of men said the move was ``basically their own choice,'' compared 
with 71 percent of women. And 26 percent of men said they were not 
that interested in college, compared with 15 percent of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Men were more likely than women to believe they could fare well  
without college degrees. And men were more positive about the work 
they were doing: 51 percent called what they were doing a 
``career'' rather than a ``job.'' Comparatively, 26 percent of 
women described their post-high school work as a ``career'' instead 
of a ``job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But women were more likely to go to college for ``personal  
enrichment'' and interesting careers than men, who were more 
interested in getting the credential of a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also wanted more financial aid information, child care  
support from colleges and flexible class scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> 'Austin Powers' To Test the Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Early test audiences didn't quite understand  
it, and the opening weekend box office was nothing to write home to 
mum about. 
</P>
<P>
	But people started to get the swing of ``Austin Powers:  
International Man of Mystery.'' The modestly budgeted film made a 
respectable $54 million at the box office, then became a phenomenon 
on video. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, this quirky creation of Mike Myers, who was inspired by  
bittersweet memories of his comedy-loving, Liverpool-born father, 
has a sequel coming out this weekend, one that poses the first 
serious challenge to the ``Star Wars'' juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is accompanied by an  
aggressive, if somewhat unusual, promotional campaign: a major 
soundtrack with an original song by Madonna, toys, watches, 
T-shirts and a parade of magazine covers, from Rolling Stone with 
Myers in Austin persona, to the pet publication Cats, fronted with 
the hairless wonder Mr. Bigglesworth, the feline friend of Austin's 
nemesis, Dr. Evil (also played by Myers, in heavy makeup). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just now the question of whether the audience likes it  
enough,'' said director Jay Roach, who also directed the first 
Austin Powers movie. ``We're not presuming it will. We love all the 
hype, but we have to live up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myers says he is still stunned by how well the character has  
caught on. He said he never grows tired of people launching into 
bad Powers imitations of, ``Oh, behave!'' and ``Yeah, baby!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored,'' he said. ``Jay and I thought it was the  
consummate in-joke: You would have had to have grown up in my house 
to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin'' gets its comic sensibilities from British TV shows  
like Benny Hill and ``Monty Python.'' Myers' father adored these 
shows. And Myers adored his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Myers was born in England but moved the family to Canada.  
He sold Encyclopedia Britannica and insurance. He used to let Myers 
and his two brothers stay up late on school nights to watch 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad loved comedy so much,'' said Myers. ``One of my  
strongest memories is hearing my father laugh through the walls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years passed and Mike Myers became famous, first on ``Saturday  
Night Live,'' then with the hit movie ``Wayne's World.'' But as his 
career took off, his father's health declined, from Alzheimer's. 
Chris Myers died in 1991, and never saw his son make it big in 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very weird. My heart was broken,'' said Myers.  
</P>
<P>
	He took 18 months off from show business to read, play guitar  
and visit his aunts and uncles in Liverpool. It was during this 
time that the ``Austin Powers'' character was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was driving home and I heard 'The Look of Love' (from 1967)  
on the radio, and you know how smell is a very potent sense memory, 
I think that songs do it, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memory was of his father.  
</P>
<P>
	``And I just started talking like 'Austin,' and I was saying to  
my wife (in an Austin accent), 'Do I make you horny, baby? Do I?''' 
he recalled. ``It just came out like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three weeks he had a script and quickly got a film deal with  
New Line Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first ``Austin Powers,'' shot on a $16 million budget,  
didn't go well with the first test audiences. People didn't get the 
jokes. In one screening, the film broke and Myers had to entertain 
the audience with a stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' opened with a  
disappointing $9.5 million in May 1997. But it held on in the 
summer of ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' to more than recoup its 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it exploded on video. It was the No. 1 selling video on the  
Billboard charts in 1998 and remains in the Top 10, selling more 
than 3 million tapes, or $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where the kind of grassroots worship of the movie  
began,'' said New Line production president Mike Deluca. ``It kind 
of caught on. It had a second life.'' People threw Austin Powers 
parties, and Dr. Evil's loopy reminiscences were inscribed on 
T-shirts. (``My father would womanize, he would drink... he would 
make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark.'') 
</P>
<P>
	With this success behind it, New Line doubled the budget for the  
sequel and scheduled it for the important summer season. The 
anticipation built with a trailer that cleverly played off the hype 
surrounding ``The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the sequel, the super spy/fashion photographer with a deep  
ply carpet of chest hair goes back in time to retrieve his stolen 
mojo, what Myers describes as Austin's life-giving force -- his 
libido. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the first film, when no corporate sponsor would touch it,  
the sequel comes with a promotional campaign and product placement 
deals. (Starbucks coffee has a prominent -- and hilarious -- 
appearance.) 
</P>
<P>
	``The character of Austin is so contagious,'' said DeLuca.  
``That kind of contagious enthusiasm kind of spread to the tie-in 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One major partner is Virgin Atlantic Airways, which has featured  
Austin Powers in randy billboards (``There's only one Virgin on 
this billboard, baby'') and a radio spot in which Austin rattles 
off one euphemism after another for his favorite body part. 
</P>
<P>
	Another spot plays on the word ``shag,'' in America a quaint  
term for sex that most people link only to Austin Powers, but a 
profane word in Great Britain. Virgin Atlantic isn't running the 
``shag ads'' there, but says that's because it never runs the same 
commercials in the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not unusual for Virgin, run by adventurer Richard Branson,  
to use its name for comedic effect in commercials, and the Austin 
campaign was a perfect fit, according to Sarah Buxton, director of 
marketing for Virgin Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only are we not very big and up against airlines, but we  
only have one destination: London,'' she said. ``We like to say in 
a world of frequent flyer miles, people are married to other 
airlines, but they have an affair with Virgin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah, baby!

<HEADLINE> Man Wins $234M Suit Against Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A family of Russian descent seeking property that  
was seized after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution has won a $234 
million judgment against Russia, which failed to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Hittner awarded the damages Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee Magness' claim was based on his family's holdings in St.  
Petersburg, Russia, including a piano factory, a shopping center 
and a mansion. All were absorbed by the communists after the 1917 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of communism, the Russian government prohibited  
the nationalization or expropriation of foreign investments. The 
plaintiffs traveled to St. Petersburg in 1994 to reclaim the family 
fortune once owned by Magness' maternal grandfather, Ivan 
Karlovitch Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason, the Russian Federation and Ministry of  
Culture claimed the property was not (the Magness'),'' family 
attorney Daniel Nelson said. ``The expropriation we're really suing 
over occurred in 1994.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government claimed the Schroder properties, including two  
expensive vintage pianos Magness tried to buy when he was there, 
were national treasures, the lawsuit stated. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to get the Russians to take notice, the Magness  
family sued here in 1997 to get the court to prevent a $100 million 
Romanov jewel exhibit from leaving Houston. The family wanted the 
exhibit held as collateral for its alleged debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia objected, then stopped defending itself once the tour  
moved to San Diego. Hittner issued a default judgment Nov. 20 after 
hearing evidence only from the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Embassy spokesman Mikhail Shurgalin and the Russian  
Federation's attorney on the case, Tim Dickinson, did not return 
calls Thursday by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Raid Japanese Bank HQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Investigators raided the headquarters of a failed  
Japanese bank today, seeking evidence that its former management 
concealed bad loans and paid illegal dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, metropolitan police and securities and exchange  
officials searched the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.'s Tokyo 
head office, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fully comply with the searches,'' LTCB said in a  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also raided the home of former LTCB President  
Katsunobu Onogi, 63, the Kyodo News agency and national broadcaster 
NHK reported. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB, once one of Japan's most prominent banks, was nationalized  
last year after being declared insolvent. Prosecutors have 
reportedly summoned former top executives for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and police refused to comment on the investigation.  
NHK showed footage of agents wearing business suits filing into the 
bank's headquarters and Onogi's Tokyo home today. 
</P>
<P>
	Onogi and the two other executives are suspected of telling  
employees to falsify the bank's securities reports to coverup the 
actual amount of its bad loans, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports said Onogi ``forced'' other bank directors to  
consent to paying dividends totaling $58.7 million for fiscal 1997, 
even though the bank had in fact suffered large losses. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay the dividends, the executives allegedly approved a scheme  
to make losses appear less than they actually were, media reports 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB became the first Japanese bank nationalized since the end  
of World War II after authorities determined it had liabilities 
exceeding assets by about $2.81 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The current management has filed a criminal complaint with  
police and prosecutors accusing former executives of engaging in 
illegal business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB was founded in 1952. Onogi, who assumed the presidency in  
April 1995, resigned last September to take responsibility for the 
bank's failing business.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Confronts IBM Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An IBM manager shrugged off e-mails that  
Microsoft said contradicted his sensational courtroom allegations 
that the software giant offered price discounts on Windows if IBM 
would agree not to distribute rival Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confronted Garry Norris, a mid-level executive, with  
e-mail from another IBM employee that appeared to dispute the claim 
that Microsoft had pressured IBM to distribute Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer software instead of software from rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no proposal on the table from Microsoft to  
exclusively bundle IE on the PC Co. line,'' IBM's Scott Bosworth 
wrote in the April 1997 e-mail. The message was sent shortly after 
Norris was transferred within International Business Machines Corp. 
to another division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess after I left, they took it off the table,'' said  
Norris, the government's next-to-last witness in the antitrust 
trial. Its final witness, Princeton University computer expert 
Edward Felten, was expected to begin testifying today. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten will show the judge how he has improved his method of  
disabling the Internet browser in Windows, touching on an important 
part of the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, testimony focused on Microsoft's alleged  
aggression toward IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris insisted that his handwritten notes from a meeting in  
March 1997 with Microsoft were accurate, saying that Microsoft 
offered to increase rebates available under its Market Development 
Agreements if IBM promised not to distribute Netscape's software. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Netscape &AMP; receive more MDA $ across the PC Co.,'' he  
wrote. His testimony supported another of the government's claims, 
that Microsoft illegally wields its influence over its dominant 
Windows operating system to crush competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Rick Pepperman grew obviously exasperated over  
two days as he questioned Norris, who exhibited a Jekyll-and-Hyde 
conversion earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris accommodated the Justice Department's lawyer with rich  
answers and an unfailing memory, but resisted Pepperman on every 
response, almost as Bill Gates had fought with government lawyers 
when he was questioned over three days last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pepperman grew more and more frustrated throughout Wednesday,  
Norris smiled at one point, hands spread, and told him calmly, 
``I'm just trying to answer your questions, counselor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperman also confronted Norris with an e-mail summary by  
another IBM employee of the disputed March 1997 meeting in which 
there was no mention of any offer from Microsoft regarding 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris described the e-mail as a ``partial summary'' and said he  
called his colleague on the telephone, who told him he wanted 
Norris to ``handle that'' with senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Norris acknowledged that the software giant  
never explicitly offered price discounts on Windows if IBM agreed 
to sacrifice its rival OS/2 computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris earlier had cited a Microsoft contract offering discounts  
of $1 to $3 per copy of Windows, for example, if IBM were willing 
to adopt Windows ``as the standard operating system for IBM,'' and 
to mention Windows as the only operating system in IBM 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suggested -- and Norris agreed -- that the  
contractual clauses actually were incentives for IBM to abandon its 
OS/2 software, which directly competed with Windows. Norris said 
IBM never agreed to those provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris conceded the contract does not explicitly require IBM to  
reduce or stop sales of its software. But he maintained that the 
cumulative effect of the contract ``has the effect of killing OS/2 
in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told by Microsoft they wanted us to drop, stop  
shipping OS/2,'' Norris said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Recovers, Japan Stocks Jump / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar recovered much of its early losses  
against the yen today on rumors that Japan's central bank 
intervened to stem the dollar's slide. Japanese stocks jumped on 
optimism that the nation's economic recovery was picking up. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.26  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 118.93 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 480.12  
points, or 2.89 percent, closing the day's trading at 17,102.62 
points. On Wednesday, the average closed up 59.58 points, or 0.04 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei was its highest closing level today since May 6, when  
the index finished at 17,300.61. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Tokyo stock market closed, the Economic Planning  
Agency reported that the economy grew 1.9 percent in the 
January-March quarter over the last quarter of 1998, marking the 
first expansion after five quarters of contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	GDP is the measure of all goods and services produced in a  
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar dropped as low as 117.63 yen at  
one point as the strong economic indicator prompted yen-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback later recouped much of its early losses after  
rumors that the Bank of Japan was purchasing the U.S. currency to 
stem the yen's rally, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan does not customarily comment on its market  
intervention activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 117.63 yen and 119.50 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.11 yen, up from  
124.88 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices surged noticeably in the afternoon as  
investors waited for the release of the growth figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth was largely due to increased public works spending  
and other stimulus steps by the government, which has earmarked 
more than half a trillion dollars in this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said, however, that market gains on the latest news may  
be relatively short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook is still unclear for July through September and  
then through December. Private sector demand has yet to show a 
definitive recovery,'' said Masaaki Higashida, deputy general 
manager of the investment information and services department at 
Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 25.10 points, or 1.87 percent, to 1,367.61 
points. The TOPIX was up 3.37 points, or 0.03 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was fairly heavy with an estimated 712 million shares  
changing hands on the exchange's first section, compared with 
Wednesday's turnover of 490 million shares. Advancing issues 
outnumbered retreaters 992 to 233, with 86 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond rose to  
1.6250 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.5750 percent, driving 
its price down to 98.06 yen from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Belle Goes Head-to-Head With Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Orioles slugger Albert Belle and manager Ray Miller  
faced off in the dugout after Miller took Belle out of a game 
against the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to run out a slow grounder with two out in the  
ninth inning and going 0-5, Belle took his place in the outfield in 
the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had already decided to take out Belle, inserting Rich  
Amaral in the outfield and summoning left-handed pitcher Arthur 
Rhodes from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle didn't notice the move until he was standing in right  
field, waiting for someone to bring his glove and cap. 
</P>
<P>
	He jogged to the dugout, and as a Florida batter led off,  
television cameras captured Belle yelling at Miller, who waved him 
away. Jeff Reboulet and Harold Baines stepped in front of Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller defended the move later.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happens internally stays internally and it will be taken  
care of internally. It's the same as a clubhouse meeting or 
anything else. I plan to handle it the same way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the decision to use Amaral had nothing to do with  
Belle not running hard on the grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``That had no play in it,'' he said. ``Rich Amaral knew he was  
going in if Albert made the last out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing what every National League manager does when he's  
only got one solid pitcher rested and a couple guys on fumes. You 
take the last (batter) out and hope your closer can do the job. If 
he doesn't, at least you have a little breathing room if they 
happen to tie it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle ordered reporters away with profanities after the game.  
</P>
<P>
	He is not having a good season, with only one home run in his  
last 21 games.

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Owner Late for Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Running late, Daniel Snyder missed the first  
hour of his first practice as presumptive owner of the Washington 
Redskins. That didn't stop him from making some strong 
first-impression judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously some players are heavy and not where they need to  
be,'' Snyder said. ``We're going to fix that. And I could sense 
there are probably a few that don't want to play. Otherwise they're 
doing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's visit, during Thursday morning's voluntary minicamp,  
was his first appearance at Redskin Park since his $800 million 
offer to buy the team was approved May 25 by NFL owners. He is 
expected to close the sale later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Snyder has been quiet about his plans for the team. His  
only firm position has been that he plans to retain the Redskins 
name despite objections from some Native American groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Like every other owner, Snyder says he wants to win, although  
his timetable seems to have shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, he said the Redskins were a rebuilding team. Now, he  
sees them as playoff-bound right away -- even though they are young 
and haven't been in the postseason since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the year we make the playoffs,'' Snyder said.  
``And this is the year we show Washington that we respect the fans 
and show we're committed. It's always important to win in every 
thing I do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to step up the heat and the pressure.''  
</P>
<P>
	During the NFL approval process, Snyder promised to retain coach  
Norv Turner and general manager Charley Casserly for what amounts 
to a one-year trial. However, he must also name a team president to 
run the operation on a day-to-day basis. Snyder is too busy with 
his local communications empire to take the role himself -- he 
couldn't even get through watching practice Thursday without his 
cellular phone ringing with other business. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, Snyder addressed the players briefly, discussing  
with them his passion to win and telling them not to be fooled by 
his age. At 34, Snyder is the youngest majority owner in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder then spoke for 30 minutes with cornerback Darrell Green,  
who is five years older than his new boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very positive, in terms of an owner, that the guy knows  
business and knows how to be successful,'' Green said. ``He doesn't 
see us as horses. He is seeing with a passion that goes back to his 
childhood.''

<HEADLINE> Macarchuk Named Stony Brook Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nick Macarchuk, the coach at Fordham for 12  
years, was hired today to lead Stony Brook into its first season of 
major college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The school announced at a news conference that Macarchuk had  
signed a five-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Stony Brook failed to renew the contract of Bernard Tomlin, who  
has coached the Seawolves the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk had a year remaining on his contract with Fordham.  
</P>
<P>
	Davidson coach Bob McKillop, a friend of Stony Brook athletic  
director Richard Laskowski, was pursued for the job, but decided 
last month to stay with the North Carolina school, where he's 
coached for 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk was 161-192 at Fordham, but hasn't had a winning  
record since the Rams were 18-13 and played in the NCAA tournament 
in 1992. His last Fordham team was 12-15, the seventh straight 
losing record for the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordham moved to the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1995 and has had  
little success, losing 80 of 108 games in four seasons. But 
Macarchuk made progress last season, with the 12 victories matching 
the combined total of the previous two years. He was honored as 
A-10 coach of the year for the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk was 149-128 in 10 seasons at Canisius before taking  
over at Fordham in 1987-88. His first team was 18-15 and played in 
the NIT. His best teams were 20-13 in 1990 and 25-8 in 1991, and 
both played in the NIT. The 1992 team played in the NCAA tournament 
by virtue of winning the Patriot League postseason tournament.

<HEADLINE> Boston Cops Probe Radio Jamming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A white police sergeant has been cleared of  
suspicion he deliberately jammed the radio transmissions of a black 
lieutenant who was directing officers during the first lady's visit 
last week, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sources told The Boston Globe that an internal  
investigation showed that Sgt. Michael R. Donovan used his radio 
just once, for about two seconds, during the hour Friday that Lt. 
Valimore Williams said his radio was jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was using a different channel to direct officers on  
duty and that channel may have been jammed unintentionally by other 
officers, the Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	No problems were reported during Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit.  
</P>
<P>
	Radio transmissions can be jammed, intentionally or  
unintentionally, when several officers are sharing the same 
frequency. Williams himself said Friday's incident ``could be a 
coincidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation marks the second time this year that Boston  
police investigators have cleared a white police officer of charges 
of harassment against Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams found a noose made of police tape on his motorcycle in  
April and has filed a $1.2 million discrimination complaint against 
the Boston Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan was the supervisor of the officer who admitted making  
the noose. An internal investigation concluded the noose was part 
of a prank by both white and black subordinate officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan was not in his office Wednesday and could not be reached  
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Yankees-Marlins 'Showdown' Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- This weekend's series between the New York Yankees  
and Florida Marlins could provide a clue about what will happen in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the winner of the series has gone on to win the World  
Series each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Florida's publicity staff is advertising the  
three-game showdown beginning Friday. The hype is tongue-in-cheek 
because the Marlins have the National League's worst record, but 
they're feeling frisky after winning seven of the past eight games 
to climb within 14 victories of .500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be intimidated just because we're playing  
the New York Yankees,'' rookie outfielder Bruce Aven said. ``To us, 
it's just another team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since May 6, the surging Marlins have actually played better  
than the Yankees. Florida is 17-15 since then, while the defending 
World Series champs are 15-15. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida spotted the Baltimore Orioles $60 million in payroll  
this week, then won two of three games. The Marlins have baseball's 
best interleague record at 25-12, including 5-1 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies Aven, Preston Wilson, Alex Gonzalez, Mike Lowell and  
Kevin Millar have all hit well during the Marlins' recent surge, as 
have newcomer Tim Hyers and two young pitchers, Ryan Dempster and 
closer Matt Mantei. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got great talent,'' said former Marlin Jeff Conine,  
now with the Orioles. ``They've got a bunch of young players that 
are very talented. They're on a plan right now. They're building 
for the long term and they've got a good foundation to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' potential has stirred little excitement so far in  
Miami, where fans remain miffed about the dismantling of the 1997 
World Series champions. Florida's average attendance of 17,269 
ranks ahead of only Montreal in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend's series will draw the biggest crowds since opening  
day, perhaps reaching 40,000 Friday and Saturday, but many fans 
will be New York transplants cheering for the Yankees. The Marlins 
are accustomed to similar treatment when the Atlanta Braves and New 
York Mets come to town. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans came out opening day, and since then they come out to  
see who we play against,'' Wilson said. ``Whatever. People are 
fickle. People come to see a winner. If the city doesn't recognize 
this team as a potential winner, they're not going to support it.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Mayor Announces Resignation </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Mayor Richard Arrington is being accused  
of trying to handpick his successor by stepping down early and 
allowing the candidate he supports to take the job until the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, the city's top elected official for 20 years,  
announced Tuesday he will resign July 19. City Council President 
William Bell, whom Arrington supports in the Oct. 12 election, will 
become interim mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Bernard Kincaid, another mayoral hopeful, complained:  
``It's similar to a remote-control vehicle, with Arrington holding 
the controls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, Birmingham's first black mayor, is completing his  
fifth term. Had he quit before July 15, a special election would 
have been called.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Allow Carry-On Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weighing safety against a person's right  
to polish off his $3.70 double mochaccino, the government has 
decided that airline passengers can keep cups of coffee they've 
carried onto airplanes even through takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came Wednesday, several weeks after a flight  
attendant for Alaska Airlines complained that the FAA inspector 
overseeing the West Coast carrier was forcing it to collect 
carry-on coffee cups out of concern that passengers could be 
splashed with hot liquid if a plane made a sudden stop while 
taxiing. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors overseeing Alaska's competitors, especially those  
flying out of a coffee hot spot such as Seattle, did not have the 
same rule -- prompting complaints of unfairness. That triggered an 
agency review of the consistency and common sense of some rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorandum being sent to the agency's airline inspectors,  
Nick Lacey, head of flight standards for the FAA, said passengers 
could keep their coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will also write to airlines saying they may want to  
evaluate their preflight routine so flight attendants are given an 
opportunity to ask passengers if they want to discard any carry-on 
items before takeoff, said FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under review is the agency's policy regarding glassware,  
Duquette said. Some U.S. carriers have complained that they are at 
a disadvantage with foreign counterparts because the FAA requires 
them to collect all glassware before a plane begins taxiing. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines like to pamper passengers in first and business class  
with china, linen and crystal service, but the policy forces them 
to collect glasses and pour drinks into plastic cups once a plane 
leaves the gate. Until now, even those cups have had to be 
collected before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA rulebook says passengers must put all items in the  
overhead compartments or under the seat in front of them before 
takeoff and landing. There are exceptions for such items as books 
or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA rules also require airlines to collect ``service items,''  
which could range from a preflight drink to a food tray left over 
from the meal service. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules have come into question with the reduction in airline  
food service and the boom in airport concession stands. 
Increasingly, hungry travelers are bringing entire meals aboard 
their flights.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Olympic Gun Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A pistol said to have been given to IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch by Salt Lake City organizers is 
among those drawing the attention of federal investigators trying 
to determine if the shipment of the weapons was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The engraved 9mm high-power pistol made by Browning Arms Co. of  
Mountain Green, Utah, is in the International Olympic Committee 
museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The pistol was sold to Salt Lake organizers in 1991, according  
to Rich Bauter, Browning vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no way of knowing who got the gun. The Salt Lake  
Tribune reported Wednesday it was given to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics investigation into  
the scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games found that Samaranch 
received a limited edition pistol donated by Browning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauter said the guns weren't donated, but as many as 10 were  
sold at cost to organizers ``because we wanted to help bring the 
Olympics to Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Samaranch -- or someone else -- sent the pistol back to  
Lausanne or it was shipped by organizers remains unclear. Either 
way, the transfer may have violated federal weapons laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is required to approve shipments of weapons  
leaving the country. Violators could be charged under federal law 
with felony exportation of a firearm without a permit, ATF 
spokesman Larry Bettendorf told The Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, it was disclosed that Samaranch received firearms  
worth at least $2,000 as gifts during Salt Lake City's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. At the time, it was reported that the 
IOC chief had received two rifles and a shotgun, all made by 
Browning, and possibly a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he didn't want to insult Salt Lake City by  
refusing the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I travel I get gifts,'' Samaranch said in January.  
``Of course Utah, Salt Lake City, is a state where guns are very 
popular. I have visited Salt Lake City twice and I got a gun both 
times. I took it to Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits unlicensed dealers from exporting firearms  
from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said, ``We  
are not aware that this is an issue,'' and declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian IOC member Mario Pescante said today the controversy  
over the guns was part of an organized campaign in the United 
States against Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it very strange that this campaign starts at the very  
moment that Samaranch finds the right way to resolve our 
problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, SLOC's vice-president of communications, said  
she ``has no clue'' how the guns got to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee, being a separate entity, and with the  
Department of Justice investigating, we have no access to any of 
those kinds of records,'' she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the SLOC's attorneys have not been contacted by  
investigators regarding the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel refused to discuss the  
case, saying only that the department ``continues investigating 
allegations of impropriety in connection with the Salt Lake City 
bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Bukovac, agent in charge of the Salt Lake City office of  
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, confirmed that ``we 
have done some interviews'' regarding the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF is among the federal agencies participating in the  
Justice Department's investigation of lavish treatment, gifts, and 
cash payments given to IOC officials during Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauter said federal agents touched on the gun shipments in an  
interview with Browning officials earlier this year. He said the 
meeting dealt with guns sold to organizers over a period dating 
back to Salt Lake's first Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney told the organization's management  
committee today that games officials were being fully cooperative 
with the Justice Department probe. He said anyone who is implicated 
by the investigation will be asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would take action to make sure that person steps aside,''  
Romney said.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Woman's Sunburn Death Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An elderly Alzheimer's patient was left on a  
nursing home patio in the broiling Arizona sun long enough to 
suffer a sunburn that killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Miles, 86, a patient at the SunRise Thunderbird Care and  
Rehabilitation Center, died Sunday from burns she suffered May 18 
to her feet, legs, arms and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors had amputated her legs in trying to save her.  
Investigators are trying to determine whether workers at the 
nursing home are culpable in the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers told state investigators that Miles was on the patio for  
an hour at most. Doctors said it would take at least several hours 
of sun exposure to get the third-degree burns she suffered, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health Services is investigating how long  
Miles actually was in the sun and whether she was taking any drugs 
that would have made her more sensitive to light. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursing home's parent company, New Mexico-based Sun  
Healthcare Group, expressed sympathy for Miles' family and pledged 
to cooperate with the investigation.

	``A part of what we have to do is deal with incidents like  
this,'' company spokeswoman Karen Gilliland told The Arizona 
Republic on Wednesday. ``It's important not to jump to conclusions 
when you hear about things. It's always more complicated than it 
seems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, the Arizona Department of Health  
Services is looking into beatings suffered by two men at the 
nursing home during the past month. And a probe into the November 
death of another patient who had severe bedsores could not find 
enough evidence to reach a conclusion, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department investigated at least 16 other complaints of  
abuse or substandard care at the facility in the past 18 months, 
records show. Investigators ruled that one complaint was unfounded, 
referred one case of verbal abuse of patients to prosecutors and 
could not find enough evidence to rule on the other 14 complaints.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Suspends Talks on Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- News Ltd., the Australian arm of media baron  
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has suspended talks about selling its 
50 percent stake in the Australian airline And sett. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines said today it was disappointed by the  
decision, saying it ``had looked forward to part-ownership in the 
Australian airline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News Ltd. had agreed in March to sell its interest in Ansett to  
Singapore Airlines for $315 million, but Air New Zealand had a 
preemptive right to buy the stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Air New Zealand owns the remaining 50 percent of Ansett, and its  
chairman Selwyn Cushing has expressed a preference for buying the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines said it met with Air New Zealand several  
times to discuss the waiver of this right. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. said it was disappointed that Singapore Airlines and  
Air New Zealand had not resolved issues concerning Ansett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ansett transaction has become more complex since New  
Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd. said last week it would 
increase its stake in Air New Zealand to as much as 60 percent from 
47 percent. Cushing also is chairman of Brierley. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have speculated that Brierly is preparing to back Air  
New Zealand's move to take 100 percent control of Ansett, with a 
view to later selling part of the enlarged company to Singapore 
Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Shriver Home Damaged by Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Investigators are trying to determine the  
cause of a fire Wednesday that damaged the home of Eunice Kennedy 
Shriver and her husband, Sargent Shriver. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze damaged portions of the second floor and attic of the  
Potomac River mansion where the Shrivers have lived since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire began in a concealed area between the second and  
third floors,'' said Capt. Barry Reid of the Montgomery County Fire 
and Rescue Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Eunice Shriver -- a sister of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
the late Robert F. Kennedy and assassinated President John F. 
Kennedy -- was at home when the blaze broke out. She escaped the 
house unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said about 85 firefighters and 25 pieces of equipment were  
involved in extinguishing the blaze. One firefighter was treated at 
the scene for heat exhaustion.

<HEADLINE>  Bob Knight Investigated in Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight's famous temper could land  
him in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana basketball coach, who was convicted of assaulting a  
policeman in Puerto Rico 20 years ago, could be charged with 
battery for allegedly choking a man who accused him of making a 
racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County prosecutor Carl Salzmann said Thursday he had not  
decided whether to file charges against Knight or possibly against 
the other man, Chris Foster, 38, a Bloomington guitar-maker, for 
provoking the confrontation in a restaurant parking lot Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said he was at a Mexican restaurant in nearby  
Ellettsville with a friend and couldn't help hearing Knight's 
profanity-laced conversation as the coach sat with his wife and her 
two sisters in the mostly-empty room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of all dialogue was sports-related stuff,  
baseball, basketball, names and statistics,'' Foster said. ``At one 
point, he made a comment that was basically, `When I have a black 
player who comes into some money, I tell him, `You buy your mother 
a house and you hang onto the rest of it,' because when one of 
those people comes into money, the rest of them come out of the 
woodwork.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, who is white, said he spoke to Knight as they were  
paying their bills and that he told Knight he found some of his 
remarks offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``By this time we're starting to walk out of the restaurant, so  
I repeat to him what he said, and he says, `That's not racist.' And 
I said, `Well I'm sorry but you obviously don't understand when you 
make a racist remark.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He starts screaming at me ... I don't even know what he's  
saying, he's screaming so loud at me. I told him, `Look, calm down, 
calm down,' and he just reaches up and grabs me by the throat and 
tries to pick me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the friend, Joseph Rheinhardt, 20, separated them, Foster  
returned to the restaurant and called police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him with his hand on Chris' throat,'' Rheinhardt said.  
``I batted his arm away and stepped between them. I was standing 
right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Foster called police, he went back outside and Knight was  
still there. The coach approached him again, saying, ``Do you want 
more of me?'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheinhardt stepped between them again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was nose-to-nose with him,'' Rheinhardt said. ``He wanted to  
get through me and to Chris. At some point, I put my hand up and he 
said, `Don't you touch me.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's co-owner and cashier said they didn't see what  
happened in the parking lot but didn't hear any unusually loud 
exchanges inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the other guy shouldn't have been listening to their  
conversation,'' co-owner Jacinto Coronel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashier Usiel Reyes said he was standing by the register when  
Foster confronted Knight but neither raised his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	A waiter also contradicted Foster's allegation, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that it was a pleasant, quiet evening,'' Salzmann  
said. ``The only thing he saw outside the ordinary was a little 
girl from one of the other tables asking Bobby for his autograph, 
which he gave her. Nobody was being loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he did what almost anyone else would have done under  
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no question whatsoever about the fact that even my most  
severe critics, given the circumstances that I found myself in the 
other night, would not have reacted much different than I did,'' 
Knight told Indianapolis television station WTHR. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said it was ``strange'' that he might be charged with  
provoking the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just let it slide, you're tacitly approving (offensive  
remarks),'' he said. ``That's all I was trying to do. He engaged in 
the conversation with me freely. It wasn't until I told him he 
evidently didn't know a racist statement when he made one. If 
that's provoking or whatever, then I guess I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Then-Gov. Otis Bowen refused 
to extradite Knight to Puerto Rico, which dropped its attempts to 
get him back eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, at the NCAA Final Four in Philadelphia, Knight was  
involved in a hotel shoving match with a Louisiana State fan, who 
told reporters Knight stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was 
ejected from a game after throwing a chair across the court during 
a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied any racial connotations to the prank and noted the 
bullwhip he used was given to him by the players, including 
Cheaney. The Hall of Fame coach also has been suspended or fined 
several times.

<HEADLINE> New Moms Stay Longer in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New mothers are staying in the hospital about  
half a day longer than they did in the mid-1990s, when insurance 
companies cut childbirth stays to 24 hours and sparked an outcry 
about ``drive-by deliveries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A government study says the trend began before a federal law  
requiring insurance coverage of 48-hour childbirth stays went into 
effect last year, thanks to a few state laws that already were 
giving women a longer stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say 24 hours often is long enough for healthy women with  
uncomplicated vaginal deliveries who are having their second baby. 
But first-time mothers who generally have longer labors and more 
questions about newborn care often need a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	So in the wake of complaints about insurers forcing shorter  
stays, states began passing laws in 1995 and 1996 requiring 
coverage of 48-hour stays. A similar federal law took effect last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the nation's average stay for a vaginal delivery was  
3.2 days. That dropped to 1.7 days by 1995, but inched up to 2.1 
days by 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, 1.4 million new mothers -- 37 percent -- were  
hospitalized for one day or less. In 1997, 951,000 new mothers -- 25 
percent -- had such short stays, the CDC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Obstetricians weren't surprised, saying the difference between  
1995 and today is obvious -- length of stay is no longer an issue 
their patients discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the laws, ``patients were angry or upset'' while today,  
``it's mostly noticeable by the lack of discussion,'' said Dr. 
Fredric Frigoletto, obstetrics chief at Massachusetts General 
Hospital. ``Those that want to go home earlier are ready to go 
home, it's apparent they are and everybody feels comfortable, and 
we don't have to force people out that literally aren't ready to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separate data from insurance giant Aetna-U.S. Healthcare shows  
its members' maternity stays after vaginal delivery increased from 
1.7 days in 1997 to 2.4 days in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the change is expensive -- Aetna pays about $1,000  
per day of childbirth hospitalization -- the insurer has cut its 
previous benefit of two at-home nurse visits after a baby's birth 
to one. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger issue is whether hospitalizing lots of new mothers  
longer is beneficial: Are newborns healthier? Do women get extra 
training in breast feeding? Do they bond better with their babies? 
Thus, is the extra care cost-effective? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody yet knows. University of Chicago researchers just won  
federal funding for a five-year study of the effects of the 48-hour 
stay law. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a study just published in the American Journal of Public  
Health, the university's Kristiana Raube used Illinois births to 
estimate the law's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her conclusions: Extra hospitalization will cost about $1,400  
more per mother and baby. Overall, about 2 percent of U.S. newborns 
are readmitted to the hospital during the first two weeks of life. 
If a 48-hour initial stay eliminated every newborn readmission, the 
state's childbirth costs still would rise by 18 percent if all 
mothers took the extra day. 
</P>
<P>
	Measuring an extra day's benefit may not be easy. Frigoletto  
said for first-time mothers recuperating from longer labor, much of 
that second day is spent resting -- something they might not do at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's hospital study also examined patients with the AIDS  
virus, and found good news: They spent almost 900,000 fewer days in 
the hospital in 1997 than in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Better drugs that started hitting the market in 1995 already had  
slashed AIDS deaths. But the CDC said its study is the first to 
show these expensive drugs -- about $20,000 for a year's supply -- 
also cut even more costly hospital stays.

<HEADLINE> Marichal Considering Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer  
Juan Marichal, the Dominican Republic's sports minister, says he 
has considered resigning over corruption accusations but will stay 
out of a sense of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows that Juan Marichal was not the candidate to  
occupy this position and there are some who want me to immediately 
leave this post to which I was named,'' Marichal was quoted as 
saying in Listin Diario newspaper Thursday, implying he never 
wanted the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, The Nation newspaper quoted the Dominican  
Solicitor General's office as saying the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
Cooperstown, N.Y., has asked investigators for more information 
about the case. Officials at the Hall of Fame, which inducted 
Marichal in 1983, were not immediately available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Marichal refused to appear before a prosecutor to  
respond to allegations of fraud involving millions of dollars, 
saying he was not properly summoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is investigating accusations that administrators  
skimmed millions through the purchase of sports equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal has resisted an order to appear before the head of the  
Corruption Prevention Department on May 26 to respond to 
allegations of fraud and corruption. Prosecutor Mariano German 
Mejia said Marichal could face charges if he does not comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is above the law, and all we want is for Marichal to  
answer the allegations. He is a sensible man and I am sure that he 
will appear,'' German said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal, 64, played 16 seasons in the majors, most with the San  
Francisco Giants.

<HEADLINE> PAC Money Rises for Credit Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As credit unions urged Congress to allow them  
to expand membership, they boosted their campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Their political action committee, the Credit Union Legislative  
Action Council, contributed $1 million to congressional candidates 
for the last election, according to a Federal Election Commission 
report released Wednesday. That's $397,645 more than the PAC spent 
during the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit unions also spent more than $2 million on lobbying in  
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was prodded to act after the Supreme Court ruled that  
corporate credit unions could not accept outside members. Lawmakers 
passed legislation last summer overturning the court decision and 
rejecting an argument that credit unions that wanted to expand 
their membership should be subject to the same taxes and 
regulations as banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legislation gave us an opportunity to promote political  
action among credit union members,'' said Richard Gose, the Credit 
Union National Association's vice president for political action. 
``Contributions do nothing more than help a group have access and 
be more visible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said overall PAC contributions to candidates rose  
slightly, from $217.8 million in 1995-96 to $219.9 million in 
1997-98. More than three-fourths of the money went to incumbents, 
up from two-thirds in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	The most generous PAC was the Realtors, which gave $2.5 million  
in 1997-98. The Realtors supported legislation making it easier for 
private property owners to sue for the loss of their land due to 
government regulations, opposed efforts to eliminate the home 
mortgage interest tax deduction and backed a bill to protect real 
estate data on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our membership is very engaged in public policy,'' said Lee  
Verstandig, the Realtors' senior vice president for government 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest increase in contributions to candidates was recorded  
by Bell Atlantic Corp., which is seeking government approval to 
merge with GTE and to offer long-distance phone service. Bell 
Atlantic more than doubled its political action committee 
contributions between 1996 and 1998, from $278,464 to $783,495.

<HEADLINE>  Bob Knight Investigated in Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight's famous temper could land  
him in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana basketball coach, who was convicted of assaulting a  
policeman in Puerto Rico 20 years ago, could be charged with 
battery for allegedly choking a man who accused him of making a 
racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County prosecutor Carl Salzmann said Thursday he had not  
decided whether to file charges against Knight or possibly against 
the other man, Chris Foster, 38, a Bloomington guitar-maker, for 
provoking the confrontation in a restaurant parking lot Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said he was at a Mexican restaurant in nearby  
Ellettsville with a friend and couldn't help hearing Knight's 
profanity-laced conversation as the coach sat with his wife and her 
two sisters in the mostly-empty room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of all dialogue was sports-related stuff,  
baseball, basketball, names and statistics,'' Foster said. ``At one 
point, he made a comment that was basically, `When I have a black 
player who comes into some money, I tell him, `You buy your mother 
a house and you hang onto the rest of it,' because when one of 
those people comes into money, the rest of them come out of the 
woodwork.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, who is white, said he spoke to Knight as they were  
paying their bills and that he told Knight he found some of his 
remarks offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``By this time we're starting to walk out of the restaurant, so  
I repeat to him what he said, and he says, `That's not racist.' And 
I said, `Well I'm sorry but you obviously don't understand when you 
make a racist remark.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He starts screaming at me ... I don't even know what he's  
saying, he's screaming so loud at me. I told him, `Look, calm down, 
calm down,' and he just reaches up and grabs me by the throat and 
tries to pick me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the friend, Joseph Rheinhardt, 20, separated them, Foster  
returned to the restaurant and called police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him with his hand on Chris' throat,'' Rheinhardt said.  
``I batted his arm away and stepped between them. I was standing 
right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Foster called police, he went back outside and Knight was  
still there. The coach approached him again, saying, ``Do you want 
more of me?'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheinhardt stepped between them again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was nose-to-nose with him,'' Rheinhardt said. ``He wanted to  
get through me and to Chris. At some point, I put my hand up and he 
said, `Don't you touch me.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's co-owner and cashier said they didn't see what  
happened in the parking lot but didn't hear any unusually loud 
exchanges inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the other guy shouldn't have been listening to their  
conversation,'' co-owner Jacinto Coronel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashier Usiel Reyes said he was standing by the register when  
Foster confronted Knight but neither raised his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	A waiter also contradicted Foster's allegation, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that it was a pleasant, quiet evening,'' Salzmann  
said. ``The only thing he saw outside the ordinary was a little 
girl from one of the other tables asking Bobby for his autograph, 
which he gave her. Nobody was being loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he did what almost anyone else would have done under  
the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no question whatsoever about the fact that even my most  
severe critics, given the circumstances that I found myself in the 
other night, would not have reacted much different than I did,'' 
Knight told Indianapolis television station WTHR. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said it was ``strange'' that he might be charged with  
provoking the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just let it slide, you're tacitly approving (offensive  
remarks),'' he said. ``That's all I was trying to do. He engaged in 
the conversation with me freely. It wasn't until I told him he 
evidently didn't know a racist statement when he made one. If 
that's provoking or whatever, then I guess I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Then-Gov. Otis Bowen refused 
to extradite Knight to Puerto Rico, which dropped its attempts to 
get him back eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, at the NCAA Final Four in Philadelphia, Knight was  
involved in a hotel shoving match with a Louisiana State fan, who 
told reporters Knight stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was 
ejected from a game after throwing a chair across the court during 
a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied any racial connotations to the prank and noted the 
bullwhip he used was given to him by the players, including 
Cheaney. The Hall of Fame coach also has been suspended or fined 
several times.

	NATO Announces Halt to Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO today announced a suspension of  
its airstrikes against Yugoslavia after verifying the withdrawal of 
Serb forces was underway. ``A few moments ago I instructed Gen. 
Wesley Clark to suspend NATO's air operations,'' said NATO 
Secretary General Javier Solana. The withdrawal of Yugoslav 
security forces from Kosovo is taking place in accordance with the 
peace implementation deal worked out between NATO and Serb forces 
last night, Solana added.

	Serb Forces Begin Leaving Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes,  
Yugoslav convoys began withdrawing from Kosovo today as part of a 
peace deal signed by Serbian and Western generals to end the 
Balkans conflict. Soldiers in the convoy smiled and flashed the 
three-fingered Serb sign denoting unity. NATO warplanes flew 
overhead monitoring the noon (7 a.m. EDT) pullout, which began 
several hours later than the allies had expected. Once NATO gives 
the order, British and French troops will be the first to enter 
Kosovo as part of the peacekeeping force. ``It looks as if we're in 
the end game,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said today.

	Jobless Claims Jump by 14,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits shot up last week to the highest level since 
early January. The Labor Department reported today that 323,000 
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits last week, up by 
14,000 from the previous week. The increase was unexpected. 
Analysts had expected the number of claims for unemployment 
benefits to inch down slightly. Even with the increase in jobless 
claims, the number of Americans putting in for unemployment 
benefits is still low.

	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The morning after she faced protesters

Hillary Rodham Clinton said today she hasn't yet secured a New York 
residence. ``I think a Democrat will win this Senate race and I'm 
looking forward to going out and listening to New Yorkers and just 
having a good time,'' Mrs. Clinton told NBC. She took a jab at 
Republicans, saying the way they've handled gun control legislation 
shows the Democratic Party ``is much more in touch with the 
mainstream -- not only of America, but particularly of New York.''

	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- An expensive experimental  
antimissile missile did today what it had been unable to do on six 
previous attempts -- hit a flying target. A white puff of smoke in 
the southern New Mexico sky marked where the Army's Theater 
High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile struck a target 
missile. Before today, the $3.9 billion system had missed its 
target on six consecutive attempts.

	14 Pct. of Indonesia Votes Counted  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police bolstered security around  
Jakarta today as a slow election vote count fed anxiety that 
Indonesia's long tradition of vote-rigging was again plaguing the 
country. Election officials deny any improprieties, saying they 
have been swamped by the 113 million votes cast in Monday's 
parliamentary election. Unofficial results released to journalists 
showed that just 14 percent of the votes had been tabulated by this 
afternoon. The Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle, headed by 
opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, maintains its lead with 35 
percent of the vote.

	SIEDLCE, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II stressed loyalty to the  
church today and warned young people against falling victim to 
``travesties of religion, or to manipulations of the truth.'' At a 
Mass attended by thousands of Roman Catholics and Eastern rite 
Catholics from Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, the pontiff called for 
people to follow the example of 13 martyrs slain in Pratulin in 
1874 for resisting conversion to Orthodox Christianity. ```How 
sweet it is to die for the faith.' These were their last words,'' 
John Paul said.

<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight is  
being investigated for assaulting a fellow patron at a restaurant, 
Monroe County Prosecutor Carl Salzmann said today. No charges have 
been filed, but Knight may face a misdemeanor charge of battery, 
which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $5,000 
fine. Salzmann said the 38-year-old man who claims he was assaulted 
also could be charged with provocation.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Judges Nation's Highest Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A new law will make many of Alabama's  
judges the highest paid in the nation, with state Supreme Court pay 
surpassing that of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The law will add pay hikes over three years, boosting trial  
judges with 20 years of experience to $139,966. A veteran Supreme 
Court chief justice will get $191,284, far ahead of the chief 
justice of the U.S. Supreme Court at $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Don Siegelman let the pay raises become law Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at this as a measure that affected the safety of our  
citizens. It is important to attract and retain judges and 
prosecutors with experience and ability,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The raises passed the Legislature with bipartisan support.  
Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, who has been trying to change 
Alabama's reputation for huge punitive damage verdicts, said higher 
salaries are need to get high-quality attorneys to run for 
judgeships. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at us nationally, the biggest eyesore we've had  
has been our judicial system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law ends the practice of paying judges a flat amount and  
goes to a system based on years of service. It also phases out 
extra salaries that some county governments gave to judges. 
</P>
<P>
	A spring survey of judicial salaries by the National Center for  
State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., shows the pay raises will make 
Alabama's Supreme Court the highest paid in the country. Circuit 
judges with 20 years of experience will be the highest paid trial 
court judges in the country, while circuit judges with no 
experience will be the seventh highest-paid. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the increases, the Legislature raised court fees,  
including adding $30 to speeding tickets and other traffic 
offenses.

<HEADLINE> NL Ump Cuzzi Gets a Second Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Out of baseball, Phil Cuzzi seemed to be out of luck. His career  
as an aspiring big league umpire over, he tried to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a bartender. He was a substitute teacher. He was in the  
restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there were times when I didn't do anything,'' he said. ``I  
was just so down and so embarrassed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, an incredible break.  
</P>
<P>
	Working at the VIP lounge at a hotel in New Jersey in July 1996,  
a chance meeting with NL president Len Coleman led to a unique 
second chance: Cuzzi could return to the only job he ever wanted, 
provided he started over at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	The result? After a long road through all levels of the minors,  
Cuzzi will be back in the majors for the first time in six years 
Friday night when he handles the Baltimore-Atlanta game at Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they called and said I was working this weekend, the  
first thing I did was call my wife and she started crying,'' the 
43-year-old Cuzzi said Thursday. ``And when I hung up the phone, I 
started crying like a baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi is scheduled to work the plate on Sunday night -- Mike  
Mussina vs. John Smoltz on ESPN -- taking the place of Eric Gregg, 
out for the past month because of health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Cuzzi heads back to the International League, where  
he's the lowest-paid umpire in Triple-A. Beyond that, nothing is 
certain for the undaunted ump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the future holds,'' said Cuzzi, who had a  
game Thursday night in Norfolk, Va. ``There were no promises, no 
guarantees and no shortcuts when Mr. Coleman made this possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Coleman: ``I could tell he was committed to umpiring. He  
wanted back in, and I thought he deserved another opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL crew chief Bruce Froemming was among many championing Cuzzi's  
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Phil when he was here the first time. I applaud his  
courage and persistence,'' Froemming said. ``Phil did not want to 
be eliminated. He's like a fighter who gets knocked out a lot of 
times, but keeps getting up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi began umpiring in 1985 in the New York-Penn League. By  
1991, he was a fill-in for the NL, and he worked a total of 95 
games in the majors in a three-year span -- ejecting the likes of 
Bobby Bonilla, Dallas Green and Jim Lefebvre along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on the day before Thanksgiving in 1993 came the dreaded  
call. He had done well, but there were no foreseeable spots for him 
in the majors, and he was being released -- forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Though about a dozen pro umps get dropped each year, ``I  
couldn't believe it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi was working at the Hilton in Short Hills, N.J., in July  
1996 when he heard Coleman coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi happened to have a letter in his pocket that he was  
preparing to send to Coleman. So after finishing his night shift, 
Cuzzi knocked on Coleman's door. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman was in the shower. Cuzzi said he had a letter to deliver  
but didn't identify himself, and when he came back a half-hour 
later, Coleman was asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi slipped the letter under the door, then found out Coleman  
had a wakeup call at 7 a.m. Cuzzi returned early the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pacing in the hall, back and forth in front of his  
room,'' Cuzzi recalled. ``It felt like I was out there forever, but 
it was probably 30 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the door opened and they were face-to-face.  
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, I kind of jumped back. It surprised me,'' Coleman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he thought I was a nut or a stalker,'' Cuzzi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They talked for about 20 minutes, and Coleman promised he would  
call. Two weeks later, he presented Cuzzi with this option: Work 
one year in Class A, one year in Double-A and one year in Triple-A, 
and then whatever happens, happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi spent the 1997 season in the Florida State League, teamed  
with umpires half his age, getting $2,000 per month and daily $17 
meal money, and driving his car to games. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 1998 in the Eastern League and now is in the  
International League. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're part of his journey here,'' IL president Randy Mobley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi got his chance this weekend because the eight fill-in  
umpires the NL employs are working, the result of a stretched staff 
during interleague play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there were a lot of people who thought I was crazy for  
pursuing this. But I had the support of my wife, Gilda, and I just 
knew I was meant to be in this game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of this has made me a better umpire,'' he said.  
``And when I get on the field Friday night, I know I will 
appreciate it even more.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares finished mostly higher Thursday,  
with the big Tokyo market surging ahead despite concerns that U.S. 
interest rates might be on the way up. Prices in Seoul jumped more 
than 6 percent to a nearly two-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong blue chips bucked the trend, retreating modestly late  
in the session, despite an earlier rally on news that mainland 
China had trimmed interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares soared 2.9 percent to their highest level in a  
month on optimism that Japan's economy might finally be recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 480.12 points to  
17,102.62. It was the Nikkei's highest finish since May 6, when it 
closed at 17,300.61. On Wednesday, the Nikkei had been virtually 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	On currency markets, the U.S. dollar bounced back from recent  
losses against the Japanese yen, amid rumors that the Japanese 
central bank was intervening to prop up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.26  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 118.93 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong blue chip stocks finished lower, as late selling in  
the futures market wiped out big early gains that followed lower 
interest rates in mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index fell 35.21 points, or 0.3 percent, to  
12,839.21 on Asia's second-biggest exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	An early rally, led by companies with close links to China, had  
pushed the Hang Seng up by almost 2 percent, following a lackluster 
session on Wednesday in which the index had finished with a tiny 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	But foreign investors began selling Hong Kong stock futures late  
in the day, amid concerns that the United States might raise 
interest rates, forcing Hong Kong to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, Korean blue chips soared 6.5 percent, with the Kospi  
index up 52.6 points at 856.06, its highest close in almost two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean shares overcame early losses as the rise by the  
Japanese yen spread enthusiasm through the Seoul market. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, shares rallied as foreign institutional investors  
poured cash into the market. The blue chip Straits Times Index rose 
23.46 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,030.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful elections in neighboring Indonesia has fueled  
recent positive sentiment on the Singapore exchange, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA -- Indonesian shares fell amid concern about the slow  
vote count from Monday's elections. The JSX Composite Index fell 
14.401 points, or 2.1 percent, to 664.569 -- well above its early 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI -- An optimistic outlook for Taiwanese bank shares pushed  
the Weighted Price Index up by 39.05 points, or 0.49 percent, to 
7,996.76. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysia's Composite Index rose 10.19 points, or  
1.3 percent, to 767.69 as investors bet on a local and regional 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY -- Shares were mostly lower, with traders waiting for  
fresh cues from Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index dropped 6.9 
points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,987.6. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON -- Shares rose on strong corporate earnings. The  
NZSE-40 rose 14.03 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,128.45. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA -- Blue chips were slightly higher amid an uncertain  
outlook on U.S. interest rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies closed up 6.45 points, or 0.3 percent, at 
2,377.07. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK -- Thai shares ended little changed after an early rally  
ran out of steam. The SET index rose 0.94 point, or 0.2 percent, to 
511.44.

<HEADLINE> TV Makers To Meet V-Chip Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- V-chips have made their way into a growing  
number of new television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission announced Wednesday that  
most television manufacturers have put the blocking technology in 
at least half of their new sets. They predicted TV makers should 
have few problems meeting a year-end deadline to install the 
blocking technology in all new televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	V-chips are intended to give viewers, primarily parents, the  
option of blocking shows they find objectionable. A 1996 
telecommunications law requires that all new TV sets 13 inches and 
larger must be equipped with the v-chip by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC imposed a July 1 deadline on manufacturers to  
install the technology in at least half their new sets. Nearly all 
of them met the deadline, FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The v-chip is about to become a reality,'' she said during a  
news conference where the technology was demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers in compliance represent 90 percent of all  
television sets sold in the country. Information was not available 
on the remaining 10 percent, but Tristani added that ``we have no 
reason to believe they won't comply with the deadlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panasonic announced that its 1999 television models are 100  
percent compliant with v-chip integration. 
</P>
<P>
	The v-chip works in coordination with an electronically coded TV  
ratings system. Most television and cable networks use letter 
notations or age-based ratings to flag violence, sexual situations, 
crude language and suggestive dialogue.

<HEADLINE> FDA Restricts Sale of Trovan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular antibiotic Trovan can damage  
patients' livers badly enough that it should be used only in 
emergencies when other drugs won't do, the government said in an 
unusual move that restricts sales of the prescription medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	To make sure doctors comply, Trovan will no longer be sold in  
general pharmacies, the Food and Drug Administration announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan should be used only for patients in hospitals or nursing  
homes who have certain life-threatening infections for which the 
need for the antibiotic outweighs its liver risks, the FDA said. 
Consequently, it will be sold only in those facilities, not in 
regular drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
	If patients using intravenous Trovan are well enough to go home,  
doctors would give them enough Trovan pills to complete their 
treatment rather than writing a prescription a regular drug store 
would fill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only way to get the message across that this really  
was not supposed to be used for the run-of-the-mill outpatient 
infection,'' said FDA drug chief Dr. Murray Lumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February 1998, the FDA said, 140 cases of liver damage  
have been reported among Trovan users. It said in 14 cases, the 
drug apparently caused the most severe liver damage, called acute 
liver failure. Six patients died, three survived with liver 
transplants, and three recovered without a transplant. Two others 
still are being treated. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA maintains that Trovan's liver risks were not apparent in  
pre-market testing of the drug. Thus, the agency initially allowed 
the antibiotic to be sold as a broad treatment for everything from 
minor skin infections to severe hospital infections. Some 2.5 
million people have used it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the reports of liver damage began. Last month, the European  
Union warned Europeans to stop taking Trovan if they experience 
liver damage symptoms such as fatigue, yellowing skin or eyes, 
stomach pain with nausea or vomiting, or dark urine. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a consumer advocacy group urged that Trovan be banned  
in the United States, saying Americans can buy eight other equally 
effective but less risky antibiotics. The advocacy group Public 
Citizen repeated that recommendation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA concluded, in a public health advisory to the nation's  
doctors, that Trovan no longer should be used for outpatients or 
less serious infections. But the agency said Trovan treats a 
slightly broader range of some of the most dangerous germs in 
hospitalized patients -- such as deadly abdominal infections -- and 
was important for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the drug, said even though it  
agreed to the restriction, other antibiotics have similarly 
dangerous risks. ``We honestly don't believe Trovan needed to be 
restricted in this way,'' said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer vice 
president.

<HEADLINE> Gasleak Ignites Fire, Burns Two Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- A gasoline pipeline leak ignited a  
fireball that barreled down a creek for a half-mile Thursday, 
burning two youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion near the city's water treatment plant on Whatcom  
Creek sent a cloud of black smoke about 30,000 feet into the sky 
over this northwest Washington city, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like Mount St. Helens!'' said Michele Higgins,  
public information officer for Whatcom County Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital said it was told at least two juveniles were in need  
of treatment for severe burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire scorched both sides of the creek, burning trees and  
other vegetation, he said. Police did not know what sparked the 
fire, which burned out within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters continued to battle smaller fires ignited by the  
blaze.

<HEADLINE> Boys Charged With Attempted Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy and his 12-year-old brother are  
accused of trying to kill a 3-year-old girl by beating and kicking 
her and forcing her into a clothes dryer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her in a mean voice to get in the dryer,'' the older  
boy told the Detroit Free Press in a story published today. ``She 
was turning around inside and after a few moments, I let her out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne County Family Court Referee Richard McKnight on Wednesday  
ordered the boys held in lieu of $20,000 bonds pending a June 17 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was hospitalized in serious condition with burns to her  
chest and back, bruises to her face and neck, and a possibly 
lacerated liver. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her mother had been staying with the boys' family  
because their utilities had been shut off. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman left her daughter and infant son with the boys'  
16-year-old sister when she went to work Monday. The 13-year-old 
told police his sister went out that night, leaving the children 
with her brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy told the newspaper he punched and kicked the girl  
because she wouldn't stop crying, then told her to get in the 
dryer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother noticed injuries on her daughter when she returned  
home about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor John Knappmann said the girl  
may also have been sexually abused and purposely burned with a 
candle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comprehend it,'' the boys' father said Wednesday. ``If  
he's guilty of hurting that kid, I'm all for the system 
straightening him out.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares finished mostly higher Thursday,  
with the big Tokyo market surging ahead despite concerns that U.S. 
interest rates might be on the way up. Prices in Seoul jumped more 
than 6 percent to a nearly two-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong blue chips bucked the trend, retreating modestly late  
in the session, despite an earlier rally on news that mainland 
China had trimmed interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares soared 2.9 percent to their highest level in a  
month on optimism that Japan's economy might finally be recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 480.12 points to  
17,102.62. It was the Nikkei's highest finish since May 6, when it 
closed at 17,300.61. On Wednesday, the Nikkei had been virtually 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	On currency markets, the U.S. dollar bounced back from recent  
losses against the Japanese yen, amid rumors that the Japanese 
central bank was intervening to prop up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.26  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 118.93 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong blue chip stocks finished lower, as late selling in  
the futures market wiped out big early gains that followed lower 
interest rates in mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index fell 35.21 points, or 0.3 percent, to  
12,839.21 on Asia's second-biggest exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	An early rally, led by companies with close links to China, had  
pushed the Hang Seng up by almost 2 percent, following a lackluster 
session on Wednesday in which the index had finished with a tiny 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	But foreign investors began selling Hong Kong stock futures late  
in the day, amid concerns that the United States might raise 
interest rates, forcing Hong Kong to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, Korean blue chips soared 6.5 percent, with the Kospi  
index up 52.6 points at 856.06, its highest close in almost two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean shares overcame early losses as the rise by the  
Japanese yen spread enthusiasm through the Seoul market. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, shares rallied as foreign institutional investors  
poured cash into the market. The blue chip Straits Times Index rose 
23.46 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,030.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful elections in neighboring Indonesia has fueled  
recent positive sentiment on the Singapore exchange, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA -- Indonesian shares fell amid concern about the slow  
vote count from Monday's elections. The JSX Composite Index fell 
14.401 points, or 2.1 percent, to 664.569 -- well above its early 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI -- An optimistic outlook for Taiwanese bank shares pushed  
the Weighted Price Index up by 39.05 points, or 0.49 percent, to 
7,996.76. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysia's Composite Index rose 10.19 points, or  
1.3 percent, to 767.69 as investors bet on a local and regional 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY -- Shares were mostly lower, with traders waiting for  
fresh cues from Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index dropped 6.9 
points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,987.6. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON -- Shares rose on strong corporate earnings. The  
NZSE-40 rose 14.03 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,128.45. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA -- Blue chips were slightly higher amid an uncertain  
outlook on U.S. interest rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies closed up 6.45 points, or 0.3 percent, at 
2,377.07. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK -- Thai shares ended little changed after an early rally  
ran out of steam. The SET index rose 0.94 point, or 0.2 percent, to 
511.44.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Says No Large Tax Cut Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The robust American economy is in no need of a  
major tax cut like the 10-year, $778 billion package being 
developed by congressional Republicans, Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin told Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting behind closed doors in the Capitol on Wednesday with  
seven key Democrats, Rubin said a better use for projected surplus 
money left over once Social Security and Medicare are safeguarded 
would be to pay down the nation's debts, according to participants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say they would like nothing to happen,''  
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, top Democrat on the 
Senate Finance Committee. ``The economy is in full employment, with 
low interest rates. This economy doesn't need any stimulus. ... 
That's their view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan and other participants said no final decision was  
reached on whether Democrats will offer an alternative to the 
still-evolving Republican tax relief package. Republican leaders in 
the House and Senate plan to release separate draft proposals in 
July and have asked for Democratic input. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and the man nominated by President Clinton to succeed him,  
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, left the Capitol 
meeting without speaking to reporters. The president's fiscal 2000 
budget calls for targeted tax cuts worth $75.3 billion over five 
years, but they are paid for with increases many in the GOP oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said most Democrats believe the  
Republican tax cut would eat up money needed for critical programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest problem with the Republican tax bill is that it's  
so large that it's forcing deep cuts. ... They're going to have to 
cut veterans programs, housing, education, all sorts of things,'' 
Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, however, believe the existence of the surplus is a  
golden opportunity to reduce taxes without slashing spending and 
say tax cuts are second in priority only to guaranteeing Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is a bipartisan package of tax cuts,'' Senate Finance  
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., told panel members in a 
letter this week. ``I hope to build the package on tax relief 
proposals supported on both sides of the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if such support is possible, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,  
said, ``That's unclear at this point. It's way too early to tell.''

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Defends Store Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Philip Morris Inc. never meant for its  
``Retail Leaders'' program to coerce retailers to sell its Marlboro 
products over rival brands, a company executive testified today at 
a hearing on rival cigarette makers' request that the program 
should be halted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't do that,'' James Mortensen, a co-creator of the  
program for Philip Morris, told the court as he defended the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Philip Morris competitors -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,  
Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp. -- are 
asking U.S. District Judge Frank Bullock to issue a preliminary 
injunction stopping ``Retail Leaders'' until a jury trial can be 
held on their lawsuit challenging the program. 
</P>
<P>
	They claim the program violates state and federal antitrust  
laws; Philip Morris denies wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was expected to conclude later today. It was unclear  
whether Bullock would issue an oral ruling at the hearing's 
conclusion, or rule in writing later. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses warned Wednesday that Philip Morris could gain a 60  
percent to 70 percent share of U.S. cigarette sales if allowed to 
continue the program, which rewards stores that prominently display 
its brands with generous discounts. Philip Morris products now 
account for nearly 54 percent of all U.S. retail cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	First implemented by Philip Morris last fall, the marketing  
program entitles retailers to rebates of $5.50 or more per 
cigarette carton and additional payments for devoting their most 
prominent counter space to Philip Morris products. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision in the ``Retail Leaders'' contract says if Philip  
Morris furnishes a cigarette display for a retailer, it can demand 
that only Philip Morris products be advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortensen testified Wednesday that each participating retailer  
can decide where a product or advertisement is displayed under the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, the decision is up to the retailer,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But under cross-examination late Wednesday, Mortensen  
acknowledged the program prohibited retailers from accepting any 
offer to improve the positioning of a rival product. 
</P>
<P>
	If a retailer accepted such an offer, said Mortensen, he no  
longer would be considered a ``Retail Leaders'' participant. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Spell, Lorillard's executive vice president of sales and  
marketing, said Wednesday the ``Retail Leaders'' has had a 
disastrous affect on his company, with 4,000 of its 88,000 accounts 
lost in the last 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in management with this company for 20 years, and  
never during my tenure have I seen this kind of decrease,'' Spell 
said, adding that Lorillard could lose 75 percent of its contract 
agreements because of Philip Morris' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Barger, chief operating officer of Morgan Oil &AMP; Propane of  
Waynesville, N.C., testified that he decided against participating 
in the program, even though his 22-store chain would have received 
up to $500,000 in financial incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the incentives, known as ``buy-downs,'' would have made  
it possible for his Convenience King stores to sell Philip Morris 
cigarettes at a lower price, but that he would have had to 
virtually stop selling rival brands. He couldn't do it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to offer as many tobacco products as we can,'' Barger  
said, adding that vendors of beer, soft drinks and snack food never 
set conditions on displaying and selling rival products like Philip 
Morris did.

<HEADLINE>  Bettman: NHL in State of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The NHL lost Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux to  
retirement, and now it might lose the Pittsburgh Penguins, too. 
Owners are bleeding money, TV ratings are down. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of the NHL? Call it a state of flux, of transition, of  
worry. Yet, one of cautious optimism, too. 
</P>
<P>
	As football, baseball and basketball thrive with exciting home  
run races and unpredictable playoffs and survive labor disputes and 
Michael Jordan's retirement, the NHL is nervously trying to 
maintain its niche among the big four sports. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't easy, not with one team in bankruptcy and another team  
short of money, and nearly every franchise -- even the marquee names 
-- losing enormous bundles of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Network TV revenues will jump appreciably next season under a  
new contract with ABC and ESPN, but NHL teams still will earn only 
6 percent of what a single NFL franchise makes from TV. That's 
understandable; hockey's most-watched games attract an audience 
less than one-tenth the size of the viewership for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest-rated NHL game was the 1996 All-Star game, getting a  
4.1 rating. That's about half of what the World Wrestling 
Federation draws on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great game,'' commissioner Gary Bettman said. ``We  
just have to get more people to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even as it expands to Atlanta, Columbus and Minnesota to  
bring its league to 30 franchises by the 2000-01 season, the NHL is 
preoccupied with keeping afloat the Penguins and the New York 
Islanders, teams that have won a combined six Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are operating under federal bankruptcy protection,  
the first major U.S. pro sports team to do so since the Penguins 
themselves a quarter-century ago. The franchise's fate likely will 
be decided June 24, when a group led by Hall of Famer Lemieux could 
have its takeover plan approved by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders, looking for new ownership and a new arena, have  
cut their payroll so drastically that their one remaining star, 
Zigmund Palffy, is on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
	So many problems. So much work for hockey to do. So few  
recognizable stars to promote, especially now that Gretzky and 
Lemieux have joined Jordan in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Think selling Michael Peca as a household name is easy?  
</P>
<P>
	``But Rocket Richard retired and the game went on, and Gordie  
Howe retired and the game went on,'' Bettman said. ``The game will 
go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's game plan for a prosperous NHL:  
</P>
<P>
	--Continue to increase revenues, which have jumped by $500  
million in five years, by moving into even more new 
money-generating arenas and stimulating interest in hockey 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Slow skyrocketing salaries with judicious personnel decisions  
and, ultimately, through a new collective bargaining agreement, 
even though the current deal doesn't end until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenues in the last five years have increased at a phenomenal  
rate but, having said that, players' salaries for the last two 
years have grown faster than our growth in revenues,'' Bettman said 
Wednesday. ``In the final analysis, that is not going to continue 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Promote, promote, promote to build a younger and broader fan  
base. Not with glowing hockey pucks or Zamboni races, but by 
enticing fans to watch the game in person, where it much better 
appreciated than on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Correcting hockey's myriad problems won't be easy, especially  
since the game remains indigenous to the sparsely populated plains 
and provinces of Canada, not to the Sun Belt cities where the sport 
has migrated. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as usual, it comes down to money. Always, money.  
</P>
<P>
	Because its national TV ratings and, subsequently, its national  
TV revenues are so much lower than football, baseball or 
basketball, hockey spends a disproportionate amount of its revenues 
on salaries -- approximately 72 percent, or 9 percentage points more 
than any other sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek's $8 million salary, for  
example, rivals that of Mark McGwire. But McGwire's St. Louis 
Cardinals play twice as many games before twice as many fans and 
make five times as much in national TV income as Hasek's Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	And what is the more magical number: Hasek's .939 playoff save  
percentage or McGwire's 70 home runs? 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we are paying 133 percent of our gate receipts to  
the players,'' Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden said at a 
recent Board of Governors meeting. ``Take every single ticket that

just to pay them. Just them! We've got problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Penguins bankruptcy hearing last week, NHL general counsel  
William Daly estimated that 20 of the NHL's 27 teams are losing 
money. The figure is questionable because it does not count arena 
revenues that some teams control, but the general consensus around 
the league is that at least half the franchises aren't profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Montreal Canadiens, who are to hockey what the Yankees  
are to baseball, caused a ripple of disbelief in Canada by 
revealing they lost $3.8 million at the same time they moved into a 
new arena this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tampa Bay, Art Williams became so disenchanted with the sport  
so quickly that he agreed to sell the Lightning midway through his 
first season of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing money is one thing but, as Kings president Tim Leiweke  
said, ``If the league keeps going in this direction, it's going to 
be losing franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may come as soon as this month if Lemieux's buyout plan in  
Pittsburgh is disapproved, though that does not appear likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we have teams losing money,'' Bettman  
said. ``Even if it were one team, it would be too many. The worst 
case is it is a four- or five-year phenomenon. The best case is it 
will start correcting itself sooner. It isn't going to be a 
long-term problem because it is going to get fixed.''

<HEADLINE> PAC Money Rises for Credit Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's credit unions boosted their  
giving to members of Congress as they urged lawmakers to pass a 
bill allowing more people to join credit unions -- despite a Supreme 
Court decision restricting their membership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission reported Wednesday that the  
credit unions' political action committee contributed $1 million to 
congressional candidates for the last election, $397,645 more than 
the PAC spent during the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit unions also spent more than $2 million on lobbying in  
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to influence the policy agenda through their  
campaign contributions and their lobbying spending,'' said Paul 
Hendrie, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
nonpartisan research group. ``You see the spending rise among 
interest groups who have issues before Congress at a given time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was prodded to act after the Supreme Court ruled that  
corporate credit unions could not accept outside members. Lawmakers 
passed legislation last summer about five months after the court 
decision, thus rejecting an argument that credit unions who wanted 
to expand their membership should be subject to the same taxes and 
regulations as banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legislation gave us an opportunity to promote political  
action among credit union members,'' said Richard Gose, the Credit 
Union National Association's vice president for political action. 
``Contributions do nothing more than help a group have access and 
be more visible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC said overall PAC contributions to candidates rose  
slightly, from $217.8 million in 1995-96 to $219.9 million in 
1997-98. More than three-fourths of the money went to incumbents, 
up from two-thirds in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	The most generous PAC was the Realtors, which gave $2.5 million  
in 1997-98. The Realtors supported legislation making it easier for 
private property owners to sue for the loss of their land due to 
government regulations, opposed efforts to eliminate the home 
mortgage interest tax deduction, and backed a bill to protect real 
estate data on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Resistance Members To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five former members of CIA-backed Iraqi  
resistance groups jailed for 2 1/2 years will be released while they 
seek asylum in another country, the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The men belonged to two groups supported by the CIA as part of a  
U.S. effort to overthrow or weaken Saddam Hussein after the 1991 
Gulf War. When Saddam's troops swept through northern Iraq, 
thousands of opposition fighters and their families were evacuated 
by the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the men were detained by the United States. An  
immigration judge denied them asylum in March 1998 and ordered them 
deported, saying they were security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement signed Thursday, five of the men will accept  
the deportation order and withdraw any appeals, said Russ Bergeron, 
spokesman for the INS in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth Iraqi rejected the agreement and will remain in custody.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was expected to be filed at immigration court  
early Friday, said Niels Frenzen, the attorney for the six men. 
</P>
<P>
	If the agreement is approved, the men will be able to join their  
families in Nebraska but will be under house arrest until granted 
asylum elsewhere.

<HEADLINE>  Bettman: NHL in State of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The NHL lost Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux to  
retirement, and now it might lose the Pittsburgh Penguins, too. 
Owners are bleeding money, TV ratings are down. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of the NHL? Call it a state of flux, of transition, of  
worry. Yet, one of cautious optimism, too. 
</P>
<P>
	As football, baseball and basketball thrive with exciting home  
run races and unpredictable playoffs and survive labor disputes and 
Michael Jordan's retirement, the NHL is nervously trying to 
maintain its niche among the big four sports. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't easy, not with one team in bankruptcy and another team  
short of money, and nearly every franchise -- even the marquee names 
-- losing enormous bundles of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Network TV revenues will jump appreciably next season under a  
new contract with ABC and ESPN, but NHL teams still will earn only 
6 percent of what a single NFL franchise makes from TV. That's 
understandable; hockey's most-watched games attract an audience 
less than one-tenth the size of the viewership for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest-rated NHL game was the 1996 All-Star game, getting a  
4.1 rating. That's about half of what the World Wrestling 
Federation draws on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great game,'' commissioner Gary Bettman said. ``We  
just have to get more people to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even as it expands to Atlanta, Columbus and Minnesota to  
bring its league to 30 franchises by the 2000-01 season, the NHL is 
preoccupied with keeping afloat the Penguins and the New York 
Islanders, teams that have won a combined six Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are operating under federal bankruptcy protection,  
the first major U.S. pro sports team to do so since the Penguins 
themselves a quarter-century ago. The franchise's fate likely will 
be decided June 24, when a group led by Hall of Famer Lemieux could 
have its takeover plan approved by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders, looking for new ownership and a new arena, have  
cut their payroll so drastically that their one remaining star, 
Zigmund Palffy, is on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
	So many problems. So much work for hockey to do. So few  
recognizable stars to promote, especially now that Gretzky and 
Lemieux have joined Jordan in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Think selling Michael Peca as a household name is easy?  
</P>
<P>
	``But Rocket Richard retired and the game went on, and Gordie  
Howe retired and the game went on,'' Bettman said. ``The game will 
go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's game plan for a prosperous NHL:  
</P>
<P>
	--Continue to increase revenues, which have jumped by $500  
million in five years, by moving into even more new 
money-generating arenas and stimulating interest in hockey 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Slow skyrocketing salaries with judicious personnel decisions  
and, ultimately, through a new collective bargaining agreement, 
even though the current deal doesn't end until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenues in the last five years have increased at a phenomenal  
rate but, having said that, players' salaries for the last two 
years have grown faster than our growth in revenues,'' Bettman said 
Wednesday. ``In the final analysis, that is not going to continue 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Promote, promote, promote to build a younger and broader fan  
base. Not with glowing hockey pucks or Zamboni races, but by 
enticing fans to watch the game in person, where it much better 
appreciated than on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Correcting hockey's myriad problems won't be easy, especially  
since the game remains indigenous to the sparsely populated plains 
and provinces of Canada, not to the Sun Belt cities where the sport 
has migrated. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as usual, it comes down to money. Always, money.  
</P>
<P>
	Because its national TV ratings and, subsequently, its national  
TV revenues are so much lower than football, baseball or 
basketball, hockey spends a disproportionate amount of its revenues 
on salaries -- approximately 72 percent, or 9 percentage points more 
than any other sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek's $8 million salary, for  
example, rivals that of Mark McGwire. But McGwire's St. Louis 
Cardinals play twice as many games before twice as many fans and 
make five times as much in national TV income as Hasek's Sabres.

<HEADLINE> Diocese Settles Neglect Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- The Catholic Diocese of Venice has  
agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging church 
officials failed to prevent an altar boy from being molested by a 
priest and choir director. 
</P>
<P>
	The diocese also will pay for any psychological counseling for  
the former altar boy, said his attorney, Sheldon Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	The diocese acknowledged that the former altar boy, now 22, was  
molested by the Rev. Ed McLoughlin -- then assistant pastor of St. 
Charles Borromeo Catholic Church -- and former choir director 
Richard Trepinski. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claimed that the bishop of the diocese, John Nevins,  
and the Rev. Nicholas McLoughlin, pastor of the church, failed to 
prevent the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The men allegedly knew the Trepinski and Ed McLoughlin had  
propensities to molest young boys yet allowed them unsupervised 
contact with youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Trepinski pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor in 1993 and  
was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Ed McLoughlin has been living 
in Ireland and relieved of active duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints against Ed McLoughlin go back to the early 1980s when  
he was an assistant pastor in Venice, the lawsuit claimed. He was 
sent to St. Charles Borromeo so his brother, pastor Nicholas 
McLoughlin, could watch over him, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim said Trepinski began molesting him in 1991 when he  
was 13. When he confided in Ed McLoughlin about the abuse, the 
priest said he needed to be punished and spanked him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed McLoughlin then began molesting him, the victim said, and the  
abuse continued for 2 1/2 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The morning after she faced protesters with  
``carpetbagger go home'' signs, Hillary Rodham Clinton said today 
she hasn't yet secured a New York residence to use for a Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going around collecting offers of people's guest rooms and  
extra beds and pull-out couches,'' she said on NBC's ``Today 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the morning television appearance, Mrs. Clinton, schools  
chancellor Rudy Crew and jazz great Wynton Marsalis announced the 
donation of $1 million worth of musical instruments to the city's 
public schools. The donation was organized by the music television 
channel VH1's Save the Music program, which raises money and 
solicits donations from instrument manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have young people in a gang called a band than any  
other kind of gang,'' the first lady told about 500 people in the 
auditorium of Public School 72 in East Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton and Crew both referred to theories about a direct  
correlation between music education and student performance in math 
and other subjects. ``Music is a way for young people to understand 
their entire world,'' Crew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsalis said, ``I'm not talking about something that will make  
your math great and your science great. ... The important thing 
about music is that it raises the soul quotient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Today'' show and VH1 are asking Americans to donate  
instruments to the effort. Mrs. Clinton accepted several 
instruments that were brought to the show by viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady -- on her 11th trip to New York and her first  
since she announced she would form an exploratory committee to 
consider a run for the Senate -- denied news reports that she's 
buying or leasing a home in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard so many stories about apartments and houses that  
I've bought and I only wish that were true, but that hasn't 
happened yet,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked whether she was bound to make the race now that  
Rep. Nita Lowey, the only other Democrat publicly mulling a run for 
the Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
has bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a Democrat will win this Senate race and I'm looking  
forward to going out and listening to New Yorkers and just having a 
good time, to be honest,'' Mrs. Clinton replied. On the stops she 
made in Binghamton and in New York City Wednesday, she said, ``I 
learned a lot, I saw a lot of people and I had a great experience 
and I'm going to be doing a lot of that in July and August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She took a jab at Republicans, saying the way they've handled  
gun control legislation this week only proves that the Democratic 
Party ``is much more in touch with the mainstream -- not only of 
America, but particularly of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about three dozen demonstrators shouting from across the  
street outside a Lockheed Martin plant she had visited near 
Binghamton, Mrs. Clinton told reporters Wednesday that such 
protests were simply a ``fact of political life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, born in Illinois and a former first lady of  
Arkansas, has never lived or worked in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate race could pit Mrs. Clinton against Republican New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who formed an exploratory committee in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	After a visit Wednesday to a Lockheed Martin plant, Mrs. Clinton  
attended a fund-raiser for Rep. Maurice Hinchey at a Binghamton 
hotel. A dozen or so protesters demonstrated outside, and office 
building windows overlooking the hotel were adorned with several 
anti-Clinton signs. One read: ``Hillary Clinton is not qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton then flew to New York City for a $5,000-a-person  
dinner organized by financial writer Andrew Tobias at a private 
home. The event, aimed at gay and lesbian campaign contributors, 
was expected to raise at least $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 69.02 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday as good economic news for  
Japan stimulated Wall Street's fears that the unfettered growth of 
the U.S. economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it looks like interest rates are going up, stocks are going  
down,'' said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security 
Benefit Group in Topeka, Kan. ``It's that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69.02 to close at  
10,621.27. The blue-chip index, down as much as 164 points earlier 
in the session, began marching back in the last hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 15.82 to 1,302.82, and the Nasdaq composite index, 
dominated by technology stocks, fell 34.73 to 2,484.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks came under pressure after the Japanese government said  
the nation's gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent in the first 
three months of the year -- a larger increase than expected, and the 
first since the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the strong report could help sway the Fed toward  
raising interest rates in an effort to halt inflation. Last fall, 
amid a financial crisis that crippled several Asian nations, the 
Fed cut rates three times, hoping to protect the global economy 
from falling into a downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of renewed growth in Japan could convince policy-makers  
that it is no longer necessary to hold rates lower, market watchers 
said. Stocks and bond markets have been skittish since May 18, when 
the Fed indicated it might raise interest rates if it determines 
that higher rates would cool off a surging economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which are highly sensitive to inflation, fell  
Thursday, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.06 
percent. Analysts consider bond yields above 6 percent to be 
detrimental to stocks, as investors may turn to the lucrative, 
stable return of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on an inflation offensive,'' said Ned Riley, chief  
investment officer at BankBoston. ``That has undermined bonds and 
really set the tone for the equities market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of higher rates hurt bank and financial stocks the  
most. Higher interest rates cut into bank profits as lending volume 
shrinks. American Express fell 2 to 123 1/8 and PNC Bank led consumer 
banks lower, falling 1 3/4 to 56 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks also declined. Those shares, which are often  
expensive, are also vulnerable to higher interest rates as 
investors become less willing to pay a high price for a stock 
relative to its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology companies are also battling customers' uncertainty  
over the Year 2000 computer bug, analysts said. Gateway fell 3 3/16 
to 58 13/16, and network provider Cisco Systems lost 3 5/16 to 110 
7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer tumbled 5 3/8 to 99 9/16, leading the entire drug sector  
lower. Pfizer sustained its second sharp drop since the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration Wednesday restricted the use of Pfizer's 
antibiotic Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders remained focused on the Friday morning release of the  
producer price index. That report was expected to offer the latest 
hint of whether inflationary pressures have crept into the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to establish that the U.S. economy is not boiling to  
the point of explosion,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, traders listened in on Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan's afternoon commencement address at Harvard University. 
Greenspan did not address monetary policy, but kept his remarks 
confined to personal musings on trust and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 2-to-1 margin. NYSE composite volume totaled 853.38 
million shares, compared with 794.35 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.43 to 622.85, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.74 to 768.25. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.92 to 442.27.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.89 percent as  
investors anticipated the GDP report, which was released after the 
close of trading. Germany's DAX index fell 0.9 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 fell 0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.9 percent 
lower.

<HEADLINE> TBS To Launch Women's Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Turner Broadcasting System is teaming up with  
two major magazine publishers to launch a cable television channel 
aimed at women, going up against the already successful Lifetime 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The new channel, which has yet to be named, will be launched  
together with an accompanying Web site early next year, the 
companies announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS' partners in the venture are Time Inc., which like TBS is  
part of the Time Warner media conglomerate, and Conde Nast, which 
is owned by the privately held company Advance Publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service will be headed by Pat Mitchell, who heads the  
production division at CNN that won a Peabody award for its series 
on the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women represent the fastest-growing Internet population and a  
television audience that remains underserved,'' she said. ``The new 
network will provide a destination exclusively for smart, active 
women seeking relevant content and community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not release information about specific  
programs, but they said the new channel would draw material from 
style, entertaining, travel, food and parenting articles in the 
various magazines published by Conde Nast and Time. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast publishes Mademoiselle, Vogue, Bride's, Glamour and  
other magazines. Time Inc.'s titles include People, InStyle, 
Parenting, Health and Food &AMP; Wine. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture would face competition from the successful  
Lifetime channel, which is run by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., 
as well as a new channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk 
show host Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, one of the driving 
forces behind the success of Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
	While the success of Lifetime could bode well for other channels  
aimed at women, entertainment industry analysts said it was not yet 
clear that there was room for all three. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly enough topics to be dealt with, but the  
question is whether there's enough advertising to support three 
networks in the same area,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at 
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``It's just too soon to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said she thought there was plenty of room for  
programming aimed at women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lifetime and Oxygen are different from what we're offering.  
Women are half of the viewing population, and there's not only room 
for three or more services targeting women but there's a need for 
it,'' she said.

	Heavy rains pummeled parts of the Midwest and Southeast on  
Thursday, while most of the country enjoyed fair and dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms were widespread over the central part  
of the country because of a cold front that stretched from the 
northern Mississippi Valley into the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, as much as 10 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour  
period, turning normally placid city creeks into raging torrents, 
flooding wheat fields and sending rivers and streams out of their 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms also dampened the Southeast and Gulf Coast, and  
some light showers threatened Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. 
But fair to partly cloudy skies were found in much of the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a few showers were found in Wyoming and northern Utah,  
the rest of the West enjoyed fair and dry weather.

<HEADLINE> Mother Kills Husband, Two Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A mother of four who had been  
treated for depression fatally stabbed her husband and wounded 
their 8-year-old daughter on Thursday, then killed herself and two 
younger children by setting the house on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter, who also suffered burns, called police and escaped  
to a neighbor's home. The fourth child, a 6-month-old boy, suffered 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was obviously in a state of trauma and shock. It was  
marvelous she had the presence of mind to call,'' Police Chief 
James Shay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Kelly Silk, 32, asphyxiated in the fire. She  
had apparently used a chemical to start the blaze and may have been 
caught up in the first flash of fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Silk, 39, died of stab wounds. The two children,  
Jennifer, 3; and Jonah, 2, died of smoke inhalation and burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Mrs. Silk overdosed on the antidepressant Prozac  
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real shocker,'' said neighbor Austin Harlow, who got  
regular visits from the family who came to see his horses. ``She 
took care of the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family friend Joe Amato said Mrs. Silk became depressed after  
the birth of her third child, about 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took her ... a good three, four months to overcome it,''  
Amato told WFSB-TV.

<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- When the Promise Keepers came to town  
three years ago, more than 50,000 men filed into a football stadium 
to dedicate their lives to Jesus. The ministry returned to town 
last weekend to kick off a 1999 season of rallies in 15 U.S. 
locations from Connecticut to California. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest meeting, in Memphis, drew fewer then 20,000. The  
attendance drop mirrored what has occurred elsewhere in recent 
years. Critics say it shows interest is waning in the organization 
and its conservative message, but Promise Keepers leaders don't see 
it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder Bill McCartney, a former University of Colorado football  
coach, said much of the drop is due to fewer worshippers making 
repeat visits to rallies. Many have changed their lives and have 
little incentive to attend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's `Been there, done that, experienced that,''' McCartney  
said while preparing for the recent conference at The Memphis 
Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney started Promise Keepers in 1990 to bring together  
Christian men for spiritual support and enrichment. From 72 men at 
an organizational meeting, the idea quickly grew. The first 
conference, in July 1991, drew 4,200 men to the University of 
Colorado basketball arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The nondenominational ministry encourages men to obey Christ and  
become good husbands, fathers and members of their communities. At 
the rallies, men often are asked to come forward and renounce their 
sins. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance peaked in 1996, when 1.1 million men gathered for  
rallies in large outdoor stadiums like the 62,000-seat Liberty Bowl 
in Memphis. This year, 10 of the group's 15 rallies are in smaller 
indoor arenas, like the 21,000-seat Pyramid, and total attendance 
is forecast to be 450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Sherkat, a professor of sociology and religious studies  
at Vanderbilt University, said it's understandable that the 
ministry cannot continue to fill football stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a kind of burnout that takes place. It's something you  
do once, maybe twice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What people want from their religion on a day-to-day basis or  
yearly basis is stuff that happens in small groups. You don't know 
50,000 people. You know the 25 people in your Sunday school 
class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promise Keepers spokesman Steve Ruppe said large prayer  
gatherings and conferences for married couples and families also 
have become popular with other Christian groups such as Focus on 
the Family and Family Life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five years ago, Promise Keepers was the only organization  
trying to do anything in this size facility,'' he said. ``Now there 
are dozens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller arenas are more intimate than outdoor stadiums and  
are unaffected by weather, Ruppe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not an organization that's looking at a specific amount  
of growth or quarterly returns to assure us we're successful,'' 
Ruppe said. ``Our sense of success is: Are the men here being 
touched by God and are their lives being changed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller meetings also cost less, and that's important for  
Promise Keepers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, when Promise Keepers charged $60 a head to attend the  
conventions, the ministry's annual budget was $87 million. Last 
year, it quit charging admission and began relying primarily on 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	That caused a cash crunch that led Promise Keepers to lay off  
its 345 salaried employees. The ministry now has a staff of 180 
paid workers and a budget of about $41 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception, Promise Keepers has drawn criticism from  
women's groups and others who see the ministry as promoting a 
male-dominated perspective of Christianity with an overly 
conservative focus and outdated view of women. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruppe said critics fail to understand that the ministry is  
trying to move men toward becoming better husbands and fathers. 
``They're not listening to what we say, and they're not watching 
what's happening,'' Ruppe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Promise Keepers, he said, offers its followers a chance to bond  
with other men with a passion for Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing in life is a relationship with  
Christ. Here is the first time many men have had the opportunity to 
get passionate about anything other than sports and sex,'' Ruppe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd True brought his son, Wells, 11, to the Memphis convention,  
the third they have attended together. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has accepted Christ as his savior, and I wanted him to see  
how Christians reach out to others,'' True said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said it was a special time for him to spend with his  
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like for other members of my family to come,'' he said,  
``but it's just like a time for him and me.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richie Williams had a goal and an assist as  
D.C. United beat the Miami Fusion 3-1 Thursday night in Major 
League Soccer, extending its winning streak to six. 
</P>
<P>
	By handing the Fusion its seventh loss in eight games, the  
first-place United pulled eight points ahead of Columbus in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter, who scored his league-leading 12th goal, and Ben  
Olsen had first-half goals for D.C (9-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gutierrez scored for the Fusion (4-10), which fell to 0-7  
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter gave D.C. the lead in the eighth minute, extending his  
point-scoring streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Aunger, in the middle of the penalty area, flicked a  
header that Lassiter tapped past goalkeeper Jeff Cassar from five 
yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	United outshot Miami 10-4 in the first half, and eight of those  
shots came during a 14-minute stretch that produced Olsen's goal 
and a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 32nd minute, Olsen made a run down the center of the  
penalty area, where he accepted Williams' neatly threaded pass. 
Olsen's right-footed shot glanced off Miami's John Maessner and 
slipped inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made it 3-0 in the 58th minute on a fallaway shot from  
the top of the goalie box, depositing the ball into the upper left 
corner past Garth Lagerway, who replaced Cassar at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez scored on a diving header in the 69th minute.  
</P>
<P>
	D.C. played without midfielder Marco Etcheverry, serving a  
one-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton, playing in his second game with the Fusion since he was

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Alaska Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A helicopter loaded with tourists on a  
sightseeing flight over one of Alaska's spectacular glaciers 
smashed into the ice, killing all seven people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash Wednesday on Herbert Glacier, about 20 miles north of  
Juneau, killed six passengers and the pilot of the Aerospatiale 
AS-350BA operated by Coastal Helicopters, said Juneau Fire Chief 
Mike Doyle. The cause had yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Clouds and fog blanketed the Juneau area, and worsening weather  
forced authorities to suspend efforts to recover the bodies 
Wednesday afternoon. But Leif Lie, a meteorologist with the 
National Weather Service in Juneau, said flying conditions were 
reasonably good around the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters buzz through the skies around Juneau almost  
constantly during the tourist season, carrying cruise-ship 
passengers and other visitors to the massive Juneau Icefield and 
the glaciers that flow down from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the victims were passengers from the Sea Princess, one of  
two cruise ships docked in Juneau for the day, said Dean Brown, 
president of Princess Tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you could see was wreckage,'' said Pauline Acherman of  
Santa Monica, Calif., who flew on a separate tour just before the 
National Transportation Safety Board closed the surrounding 
airspace as part of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim LaBelle, chief of the Safety Board's Alaska office, said  
investigators would survey the scene to determine how the 
helicopter hit the glacier. They also would try to determine if the 
helicopter's engine was running when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just go in there with a clean slate and see what the  
evidence is,'' LaBelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Helicopters declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate accident Wednesday, two people were taken to a  
hospital after an Era Aviation helicopter crashed on Admiralty 
Island south of Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist-related aviation accidents are not uncommon in Alaska.  
Last year, a helicopter on a sightseeing trip over Juneau collided 
in midair with a small plane. One person on board the plane was 
killed, but the helicopter passengers escaped serious injury.

<HEADLINE> Inmate's Taped Speech Draws Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- The Evergreen State College's choice of  
convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal as a commencement speaker has 
drawn protests from police, a leading congressman, the governor and 
the victim's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, about 800 graduating students at the state-supported  
liberal arts college are scheduled to hear a 13-minute taped 
address from the former Black Panther sentenced to death for the 
slaying of a Philadelphia police officer in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Students invited Abu-Jamal to be among the commencement speakers  
because he has used his free speech rights ``to galvanize an 
international conversation about the death penalty, the 
disproportionate number of blacks on death row, and the 
relationship between poverty and the criminal justice system,'' 
Evergreen President Jane Jervis said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, took the House floor on  
Thursday for a moment of silence to protest the invitation, his 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no justifiable reason for an institution of higher  
learning to have a convicted murderer speak to its students,'' 
DeLay said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay said his ``heart goes out'' to Maureen Faulkner, widow of  
Officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Faulkner said she plans to attend the commencement with a  
picture of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, in a letter mailed to  
Jervis on Thursday, asked her to consider canceling Abu-Jamal's 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an affront to the memory of Officer Faulkner, his family  
and all victims of violent crime for your institution to glorify 
this cop killer,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Wins $8.5M in Libel Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sports Illustrated magazine was ordered  
to pay at least $8.5 million to ex-heavyweight boxer Randall 
``Tex'' Cobb, who sued for libel after the publication reported he 
helped fix a fight and shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court jury awarded the compensatory damages Wednesday  
to Cobb and will decide on punitive damages during a hearing 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, declined to comment on the case, saying ``I'm sorry,''  
when reached Thursday morning at his hotel room. Cobb's attorney, 
George Bochetto, said his client feels redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' Bochetto said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine's Nashville attorney, Eddie Wayland, did not  
immediately return a call Thursday but told The Tennessean, ``The 
case is still pending. I don't think that a comment would be 
appropriate at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb sued for $50 million in actual damages and $100 million for  
punitive damages a year after an article headlined ``The Fix Was 
In'' appeared in the magazine Oct. 4 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The story began with an anecdote about the Sept. 15, 1992, bout  
between Cobb and Sonny Barch, a journeyman fighter and former 
Memphis State University football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reported that before the bout in Fort Lauderdale,  
Fla., Cobb asked Barch how he planned to throw the fight because 
Cobb had an injured shoulder and wanted it to end as quickly as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb, ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch told Sports Illustrated that Cobb responded, ``Bubba, I 
appreciate it. I'll make it up to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by TKO. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb was quoted in the article saying, ``whoever believes the  
fight is faked ought to try to take the punches he threw. I 
emphatically deny all the allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and fight  
promoter Rick ``Elvis'' Parker shared a half ounce of cocaine after 
the fight. Sports Illustrated said Cobb had tested positive for 
cocaine use, but said in a followup item that it was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayland told jurors the article by senior writers William Nack  
and Sonja Steptoe was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believed the story was true. They believed it then and  
they believe it now. ... They got the story right,'' Wayland said. 
``This story was not just about Tex Cobb. It was about the dark 
side of boxing. Whatever damage (Cobb) suffered is a result of his 
own actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Steptoe testified last month she had little evidence  
that Cobb was a willing participant in a fixed fight with Barch. 
</P>
<P>
	In taped testimony, ex-heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, who  
won a one-sided 15-round match against Cobb in 1982, said Cobb was 
a true contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb said after the article was published he was considered  
damaged goods, ending his boxing career and nearly ending his 
acting career he had begun after boxing. Shortly thereafter, the 
Abilene, Texas, native moved from Nashville to Philadelphia, his 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for more than eight hours. The trial began  
May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he quit fighting, Cobb has had roles in several movies,  
including 1997's ``Liar, Liar;'' ``Raising Arizona;'' ``Uncommon 
Valor'' and ``The Golden Child.'' He's also been in the TV shows 
``Moonlighting'' and ``MacGyver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bochetto said Cobb has a small part as a football player in an  
upcoming Oliver Stone movie about the NFL.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as good economic news for  
Japan increased Wall Street's fears that the unfettered growth of 
the U.S. economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average 
was down 69.02 at 10,621.27. The blue-chip index, down as much as 
164 points earlier in the session, began marching back in the last 
hour of trading. Broader stock indicators were also lower. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 15.82 to 1,302.82, and the Nasdaq

	Jobless Claims Jump by 14,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits rose last  
week to the highest level since early January. But economists 
shrugged it off as a temporary blip in a job market that remains 
exceptionally healthy. They also expressed doubts that the one-week 
increase would influence the Federal Reserve very much as it 
considers at month's end whether to raise interest rates to slow 
down the economy and keep inflation under control. Federal Reserve 
Board Governor Roger Ferguson signaled today that Fed policy makers 
will be watching inflation indicators closely when they meet June 
29-30. The Labor Department said today that 323,000 U.S. workers 
filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending June 5 -- 
up 14,000 from the previous week.

the government reporting today an unexpectedly strong 1.9 percent 
growth rate -- the first sign of growth since the summer of 1997. 
The January-March gross domestic product increase was well above

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged  
Harvard graduates to strive for integrity and avoid the temptation 
to cut corners in their professional lives. In a speech prepared 
for commencement ceremonies in Cambridge, Mass., Greenspan conceded 
today that his advice ran the risk of ``sounding a bit uncool.'' 
But he said he believed strongly that ``your success in life and 
the success of our country is going to depend on the integrity and 
other qualities of character'' demonstrated by coming generations. 
``The true measure of a career is to be able to be content, even 
proud, that you succeeded through your own endeavors without 
leaving a trail of casualties in your wake,'' Greenspan said.

	Man Convicted in Big Pyramid Scheme

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury convicted businessman Patrick Bennett  
today on 42 counts in an indictment accusing him of orchestrating 
the biggest pyramid scheme in U.S. history. It was not able to 
reach a verdict on the most serious charge of conspiracy. 
Prosecutors had accused Syracuse businessman Bennett during two 
trials in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of cheating more than 
22,000 investors out of $700 million. The first jury convicted him 
of perjury and obstructing a federal investigation of his company 
but could not reach a verdict on the rest of the charges. A second 
jury convicted him today of 42 other counts, including securities 
fraud and money laundering. But the jury still was unable to reach 
a verdict on the first 11 counts of the indictment, which included 
conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Still, the convictions today 
were serious enough to lead to revocation of his bail.

computer science professor Edward Felten had said there was no 
technical reason for Microsoft to bundle its Web browser into its 
popular Windows operating system. In earlier testimony, he 
described a program he created to disable the browser, Internet 
Explorer, within Windows. He took the stand today after government 
attorneys introduced as evidence a newer version of his program, as 
well as a program to reinstall the browser. ``There are many ways 
in which Microsoft can go about delivering Windows 98 without IE,'' 
Felten said today.

Greenwald, head of United Airlines, and chairman of a trade group 
representing the country's biggest carriers, said the airlines had 
been ready to announce the plan but decided against it at the last 
moment for reasons he refused to explain. He promised an 
announcement in the near future. One part of the 12-point plan, a

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Targets Indian Trust Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accused of mismanaging $500 million in Indian  
trust funds, the government acknowledged in court Thursday it can't 
provide some account holders, many of them poor, with basic 
information about their money. 
</P>
<P>
	A class-action lawsuit is seeking to force the government to fix  
the accounting system and reconcile the 300,000 accounts. Lawyers 
for the account holders claim taxpayers could eventually be liable 
for billions of dollars in underpayments to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes before the trial started, government lawyers filed  
documents acknowledging that the Interior Department inadequately 
controls receipts and disbursement and doesn't provide regular 
reports and reconciliations of all accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not surprising that a reformed trust system cannot  
spring up overnight,'' Justice Department lawyer Tom Clark told the 
federal judge who is hearing the case. ``It can't be done by a 
stroke of a pen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one disputes that the government has mishandled the money for  
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	The money primarily comes from lease revenue and royalties that  
the Interior Department holds in trust for individual Indians. 
Complex land ownership has made it difficult to track the accounts, 
thousands of which are worth only a few dollars, and many records 
have been lost or destroyed over the years, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials contend they are working  
overtime to repair the system, but account holders say the efforts 
have been inadequate and halfhearted despite proddings from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over 150 years, there hasn't been an audit or reconciliation  
of Indian money,'' said Elouise Cobell, a Blackfeet woman who is 
one of the five lead plaintiffs. ``The only way we're going to hold 
their feet to the fire is through a court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is being heard by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth,  
who earlier held Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt for their departments' delay in 
producing records for the lead plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is being tried in two phases. The first will focus  
on fixing the accounting system. The second will deal with 
reconciling the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior also is responsible for $2.5 billion in tribal  
accounts. Tribes have been negotiating with the administration on a 
separate settlement of those funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to rehash the problems of the past. ... We're  
here to tell you how we're going to solve them,'' Justice 
Department lawyer Tom Clark told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs is developing a new computer  
system for handling the accounts that will be tested for the first 
time later this month in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, has questioned whether the BIA's new system will work, 
and Senate Republicans also have been highly critical of Interior's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was expected to take several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Fights Web Site Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- When MindSpring Enterprises shut down Neal  
Horsley's anti-abortion Web site with its photos of mangled fetuses 
and drawings of dripping blood, the company said the site violated 
its appropriate use policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Horsley said the move was a form of censorship and is suing  
the Atlanta-based Internet service provider for $251 million for 
allegedly destroying hundreds of e-mails when it booted him offline 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If telephone companies shut people's telephones down because  
of what they believe or because of what they were saying and they 
weren't breaking the law, then I'm sure the American people would 
understand why that has to be stopped,'' Horsley said Wednesday 
from his Carrollton home. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Tuesday in Gwinnett County Superior Court, seeks  
$1 million for breach of contract and the rest in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring spokesman Ed Hansen said he could not comment on  
pending litigation but read from a company statement that said 
``MindSpring stands behind our previous statements that Mr. 
Horsley's service was terminated for one or more violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if this does go to court, it will become obvious how  
flagrant his violations were,'' Hansen added. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley, 55, operates the ``The Nuremburg Files'' site, which  
contains Wild West-style wanted posters of abortion doctors. It 
also lists the names and addresses of abortion doctors, with those 
who have been killed crossed out and those injured listed in gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, doctors on the list were killed, most recently last  
October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was gunned down in his home 
outside Buffalo, N.Y. His name on the site was crossed out that 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley claims hundreds -- maybe thousands -- of messages and  
e-mails were destroyed when MindSpring pulled the plug in February. 
The site invites readers to send in abortion doctors' addresses, 
license plate numbers and the names of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``When MindSpring closed us down, it was in the midst of four  
months of national and international publicity. We had seven 
million hits during that period,'' said Horsley, who now runs the 
site from his own server. 
</P>
<P>
	The site gained notoriety earlier this year when it became the  
subject of a lawsuit in Oregon. There, a federal jury ordered 
several anti-abortion groups that contribute to the site to pay 
$107 million in damages because the tactics amounted to illegal 
threats. Horsley was not a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood, several abortion doctors and a clinic had  
sued the activists under the U.S. racketeering statute and a 1994 
federal law that makes it illegal to incite violence against 
abortion doctors or their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after the verdict, MindSpring, which provided the Internet  
space for the site, closed it for violating the company's 
``appropriate use policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley's attorney, John Matteson said the punitive damages  
amount they are seeking is a percentage of what the company is 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes that kind of money to get their attention and make  
some kind of impact on the wild things they're doing. They sit 
there like God erasing e-mail and deciding who can communicate with 
who,'' Matteson said.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Delayed on Tobacco Displays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday refused to rule  
immediately on a petition to stop tobacco conglomerate Philip 
Morris' new retail marketing program, which three rivals say 
violates antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Frank Bullock said he expects to issue a  
ruling by the end of June on the preliminary injunction motion 
targeting Philip Morris' ``Retail Leaders'' program. Three 
competitors claim the program forces retailers to relegate their 
brands to the back shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit itself -- filed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,  
Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp. -- will 
go to trial in the next 10 to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, implemented by Philip Morris last fall, rewards  
stores that prominently display its brands with generous discounts. 
The three plaintiffs, however, said ``Retail Leaders'' also 
requires retailers to devote their prime cigarette display space to 
Philip Morris products. 
</P>
<P>
	``What `Retail Leaders' does is take us off the counter and put  
us on the floor,'' Lorillard attorney Jim Williams said in his 
closing statement Thursday. ``It's like a snowball running 
downhill, and it will accelerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RJR attorney Richard Cooper said in his closing statement that  
an injunction stopping ``Retail Leaders'' would preserve retailers' 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Jerome Chapman said the dispute doesn't  
belong in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' witnesses warned earlier that Philip Morris  
could gain a 60 percent to 70 percent share of U.S. cigarette sales 
if ``Retail Leaders'' isn't halted. Philip Morris brands now enjoy 
a nearly 54 percent market share.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Retailer Ahold's Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch food retailer Royal Ahold's  
profit in the first quarter rose 32 percent due to strong sales in 
the United States and Europe. It expects a profit rise of up to 20 
percent for the year. The earnings increase reported today was in 
line with market expectations, but Ahold's shares dropped 2 percent 
in trading on the Amsterdam stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, one of the world's largest supermarket owners with  
chains like Stop &AMP; Shop and Giant, earned 175 million euros, or 
$180 million, in the three months ended April 25 from 133 million 
euros a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales jumped 27 percent to 9.28 billion euros, or $9.65 billion,  
from 7.30 nillion euros a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Ahold owns more than 3,600 supermarkets and specialty  
stores worldwide, and has more than 1,000 stores mostly along the 
eastern seaboard in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its U.S. store brands are Stop &AMP; Shop, Giant, Tops and  
Bi-Lo. Earlier this year, Ahold announced its intention to acquire 
Pathmark Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Its operating profit rose 46 percent in the United States in the  
first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Record Industry Fights Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The recording industry's attack on music piracy  
bit a chunk out of the booming illegal trade last year, but 
stronger laws and more aggressive prosecution are still needed to 
make any serious impact, industry enforcers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fighting music piracy today means fighting a huge, organized,  
illegal international business,'' said Jason Berman, head of the 
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which 
represents 1,300 record companies in 70 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our industry dedicates large resources to that fight but we  
need, above all else, support of the governments,'' Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the bailiwick of backroom bootleggers with a few cassette  
copying machines, music piracy has grown into a $4.5 billion 
industry with sophisticated global distribution networks and close 
ties to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the federation formed its international anti-piracy  
team in 1997, recruiting investigators and industry experts to 
sniff out the operations that produce an estimated 2 billion 
counterfeit CDs and cassettes every year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the unit seized more than 60 million illegally produced  
CDs -- half of them from Southeast Asia and Latin America -- and 
closed down major manufacturing plants in North America, Europe, 
the Middle East and Asia, the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iain Grant, the organization's head of enforcement, said the  
Mafia sometimes uses lucrative bootleg CD operations to finance 
drug-trafficking and other criminal endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not need to be a rocket scientist to expect that  
organized crime groups worldwide will get involved when there are 
profits which can be generated at this level,'' Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the federation assisted in the raid of a CD  
manufacturing plant in Naples, Italy, that resulted in the arrest 
of 14 reputed Mafia members and led investigators to various other 
criminal operations, Grant said. The plant was generating $100,000 
a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirated recordings, most often sold at outdoor markets and by  
smaller independent shops that run little risk of getting caught, 
tend to be identifiable by shoddily copied liner art, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sound quality can be as good as the real thing, he  
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Berman said the organization is hampered by inadequate laws and  
relatively light penalties for music piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``No amount of investigative work on our part, no amount of  
money, resources, time and effort will succeed in reducing these 
incredible levels of piracy if governments don't take effective 
enforcement actions that include both substantial fines and prison 
sentences,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has had a harder time stemming illegal music  
copying via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, its only recourse is trying to shut down Internet  
sites with cease-and-desist orders, which it has done in thousands 
of cases. But there are an estimated 400,000 infringing sites left 
and more coming online every day, the federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	This battle has resulted in the formation of the Secured Digital  
Music Initiative, which seeks to develop a copyright directive that 
will set ground rules for Internet music commerce, Berman said.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Didn't Get What They Wanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres accomplished what they came to  
Dallas to get -- home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not quite as good as they hoped for after winning the  
opener of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' bid to return to Buffalo up 2-0 ended when Brett  
Hull clanked in a goal off a post with 2:50 left in Game 2 and 
Derian Hatcher added an empty-netter, giving the Stars a 4-2 
victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Buffalo goes home with the series tied at a game apiece. The  
Sabres will try adding to their 7-0 record at Marine Midland Arena 
this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we are disappointed after winning the first game,''  
goaltender Dominik Hasek said. ``Now we are 1-1 after two games and 
we're started from the beginning. I like our chances with home-ice 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they arrived in Dallas, Buffalo's goal was to return home  
tied after two games. The Sabres set their sights higher after a 
3-2 overtime victory in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	By losing, Buffalo drops a chance to become the fifth straight  
team to sweep the finals. The Sabres still like their chances of 
winning their first NHL title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody said it was going to be a four, five-game series,''  
coach Lindy Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dixon Ward said the Sabres, the seventh-seeded team from  
the East, proved in the first two games that they can play with the 
Presidents' Trophy-winning Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're for real,'' Ward said. ``I think we can take  
satisfaction out of the way we played. We've got a lot of 
confidence we can win this series. That's what we'll take home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo outplayed Dallas over the first two periods, matching  
the Stars' aggressive, hard-hitting style and controlling the puck 
much better. The Sabres allowed just 12 shots over the first two 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the way our hockey club played the first two periods,''  
Ruff said. ``We didn't really let them test Dominik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars did test Hasek's will as they repeatedly ran into him  
in the crease. Dallas' Brian Skrudland was penalized for 
interference for an open-ice hit that sent Hasek into the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was a four-on-four fight after the first period that  
stemmed from contact on Hasek. Six players were given 18 minutes in 
penalties because of the melee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The physical play doesn't bother me,'' Hasek said. ``It just  
pumps me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres led or were tied for most of the game. Their first  
defict, which came early in the third period, lasted only 1:11 as 
Alexei Zhitnik tied the game at 2 with 14:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the last 10 minutes, Buffalo ran out of gas. The Sabres  
were outshot 13-3 and lost the majority of loose-puck battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was the only reason the game remained close, just like in  
Game 1, when he foiled nine straight power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	In a four-minute span, Hasek fended off one shot during a brief  
6-on-5, five shots on the ensuing power play, then turned back 
three more when Dallas had a two-man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Hasek skated behind the goal and sat down to  
catch his breath. He still had to finish off another 1:17 of 5-on-4 
play and he remained brilliant, kicking one rebound beyond the blue 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dallas' 18th shot of the period, Hasek finally cracked. Hull  
fired a slap shot to Hasek's left and it ricocheted off the left 
post and into the right side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had another power-play chance in the final minutes,  
but couldn't get their third goal with the extra man. They also 
went without Hasek in net and Hatcher made them pay, firing in a 
long shot after Dallas had cleared the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's back to Buffalo, where the Stars will have the same  
mentality the Sabres had in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to come into our building and hopefully try to get a  
split, (but) we haven't lost there yet,'' Ruff said. ``I think that 
is a big plus for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been extremely focused and played very well there. So  
we are looking for more of the same.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels attacked a small town  
with explosives and automatic weapons, killing eight police 
officers and a civilian, the mayor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia on  
Wednesday attacked El Espino, 160 miles northeast of Bogota, and 
destroyed several homes, the police headquarters and government 
offices, said Mayor Jorge Elias Carillo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They destroyed a city block,'' Carillo told Radionet radio.  
</P>
<P>
	Another eight police officers were missing and feared abducted,  
Carillo said. A spokesman at national police headquarters said he 
could not immediately confirm the information. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC, Colombia's oldest and largest insurgency, already  
holds at least 450 soldiers and police prisoner from previous 
attacks on remote outposts.

<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia will stop allowing judges who  
preside over drug and terrorism cases to remain anonymous but will 
allow the identities of some witnesses and prosecutors to remain 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	In a late-night session Wednesday, lawmakers renewed the state's  
right to shield the identities of the prosecutors and witnesses 
involved in preliminary investigations against criminals considered 
highly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	As the cases go to trial, however, judges, lawyers and witnesses  
will now appear in public view. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia created its so-called ``faceless'' courts in 1991. At  
the time, authorities were besieged by violent cocaine cartels that 
assassinated hundreds of judges, prosecutors, and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was due to expire June 30. It has been criticized by  
human rights organizations for violating due process and called 
outdated now that the drug rings have been dismantled.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A former priest has accused  
Brazil's newly appointed top law enforcement official of taking 
part in torture sessions almost three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Antonio Monteiro, who left the priesthood and now teaches  
philosophy at the University of Alagoas, said he was arrested and 
tortured in 1970 by federal police in the northeastern state of 
Maranhao. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his torturers included Joao Batista Camelo, who was  
appointed this week as chief of the federal police, Brazil's 
equivalent of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is shameful for Brazil,'' said Monteiro, who will testify  
to the Congressional Human Rights Commission in an effort to block 
the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential press spokesman George Lamaziere said the  
government stood by Campelo, who has denied the accusations. 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former sociology professor, 
also was persecuted and forced into exile by the military.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Former Public Security Minister Juan  
Jose Echeverria and two of his sons have been ordered to face trial 
on charges of improperly arranging visas for Cubans, attorneys said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reverses a ruling last month that had cleared them  
of charges. The new decision cannot be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in April 1998 accused the Echeverrias and several  
other people with taking thousands of dollars to arrange visas for 
Cubans who should not have been eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Echeverria, an attorney, was security minister from 1978 to 1980  
and is a relative of current President Miguel Angel Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors charge that Cubans were being asked to pay $5,000 to  
$7,000 for humanitarian visas that are supposed to be issued free 
of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they arrived in Costa Rica, they often quickly went on to  
the United States.

	REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican immigration authorities detained  
five people from Macedonia on Thursday as they attempted to cross 
into the United States, reportedly to seek political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav-born man with U.S. citizenship, Aco Ilinkoski, 42,  
was arrested for immigrant trafficking, Juan Triana Marquez of the 
National Migration Institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five people were arrested in Reynosa, a border city across  
from McAllen, Texas, and sent to Macedonia's consulate office in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of how the five reached Mexico were not clear.  
</P>
<P>
	Triana Marquez said Ilinkoski would face criminal charges that  
carry a possible prison term of six to 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Kozlova, Lum Tops in Swimming Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash (AP) -- Anna Kozlova and Kristina Lum posted  
the top scores after the first two days of competition at the U.S. 
Synchronized Swimming Olympic Trials at the King County Aquatic 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The team competition concludes Friday after two additional free  
swims. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimmers competed in two technical swims Wednesday and two free  
swims Thursday. The 21 swimmers who made Thursday's cut were paired 
together and will swim in groups of not more than four on Friday. 
The two swims on Friday will count for 35 percent of the final 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no scores were released, Kozlova and Lum are paired in  
the No. 1 group for Friday, meaning the two have the highest scores 
through two days. Both swim for the Santa Clara (Calif.) Aquamaids. 
</P>
<P>
	While duet competition begins Friday, the team competition is  
Lum's only chance of making the Olympic team as her duet partner 
for the past two years is Bill May. Men are not allowed to compete 
in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-ranked group through Thursday includes the only two  
returnees from the U.S. gold medal team of 1996, Tammy 
Cleland-McGregor and Heather Pease. Carrie Barton also made the 
second group. 
</P>
<P>
	The field will be paired to 13 Friday, although the team will  
not be announced until Saturday, when the duet competition is 
finished. The U.S. team of 13 swimmers must include both swimmers 
from the winning duet team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland-McGregor and Pease are considered the top duo to compete  
with Kozlova and her partner Tuesday Middaugh in the duet 
competition.

<HEADLINE>  Hoops Hall of Famers Are Nominated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale, who played in a great  
Boston Celtics frontcourt with Larry Bird and Robert Parish, has 
been nominated to the Basketball Hall of Fame, along with three 
other Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Boston players are Dennis Johnson, who won a total of  
three championship rings with Boston and Seattle; Jo Jo White, who 
played with two championship Celtics teams and won an Olympic gold 
medal in 1968; and Wayne Embry, who won an NBA championship with 
the Celtics in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	John Thompson, who coached Georgetown to the 1984 NCAA  
championship and 14 straight NCAA tournaments, also is a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Hall of Famers will be selected June 21. They will  
be picked from the nominees announced Thursday by officials at the 
Springfield shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	For enshrinement, a nominee needs 18 of 24 votes from the Honors  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980 with Parish, McHale at first was  
the team's sixth man. He went on to play 12 seasons in the all-star 
frontcourt that included Bird. The team won NBA championships in 
1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a go-to guy, just like Larry Bird,'' said Red Auerbach,  
the Celtics vice chairman and former coach who brought McHale to 
the team. ``When you need a basket real bad and the game is on the 
line, you can go to McHale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 McHale honed his offensive skills by playing  
against his high school coach one-on-one in the small town of 
Hibbing, Minn. McHale's agility, long arms and array of moves 
allowed him to shoot over even taller NBA defenders. He averaged 18 
points per game with 55 percent shooting during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, McHale set a Celtics record with 56 points against the  
Detroit Pistons. Bird broke the record nine days later with 60 
points against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird praised McHale, once saying he ``never saw a triple-team he  
didn't like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale also was picked for three NBA Defensive First Teams, as  
well as seven All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale now is vice president of basketball operations for the  
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who was backup center for Bill Russell on the 1965 and  
1966 championship Celtics, coached the Hoyas for 27 years. His 
teams went 596-239, reached the Final Four three times, and beat 
Houston in the 1984 final. The NBA drafted 26 of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	He resigned in January. Since then, he has worked as a radio  
talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	Other nominees this year are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bob McAdoo, a three-time scoring champion and two-time NBA  
champion with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Maurice Cheeks of the 1983 NBA championship Philadelphia team.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Gus Johnson of the Baltimore Bullets.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sidney Moncrief of the Milwaukee Bucks  
</P>
<P>
	-- Chet Walker, who won a championship with Philadelphia in 1967  
with Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan, whose 800-442 record gives  
him more wins than any other active college coach. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tex Winter, an assistant Chicago Bulls coach who has spent 52  
seasons at Division I college and NBA teams -- more than any active 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And Morgan Wootten, the coach at DeMatha High School in  
Washington, D.C., whose record of 1,185-178 is the best ever for a 
high school coach.

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The National Baptist Congress of  
Christian Education is expected to draw at least 55,000 delegates 
to its convention June 21-25. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a meeting of church workers, from Sunday school teachers  
to church musicians. But candidates for president of the National 
Baptist Convention USA plan to add politicking to the agenda, 
rallying support for the September election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Henry Lyons resigned as president after he was  
sentenced in March to 5 1/2 years in prison on racketeering and grand 
theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The interim president, the Rev. Stuart C. Cureton of Greenville,  
S.C., is to be among speakers at the gathering. He is not a 
candidate to replace Lyons at the National Baptist Convention in 
Tampa, Fla., in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering will include workshops on subjects ranging from  
ministering to rural churches to teen-age pregnancy. The convention 
will close with a ``Christ Alive'' rally featuring the Rev. E.V. 
Hill of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Los Angeles, one of the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the candidates who will talk about morality,'' the  
Rev. Victor McKinney, co-chairman of the local organizing 
committee, said. ``They'll talk about sound leadership, integrity 
and honesty.''

<P>
	SPENCER, S.D. (AP) -- One year after a tornado destroyed their  
place of worship, members of Trinity Lutheran Church celebrated 
their new edifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spirit of God is living in Spencer,'' the Rev. Tom  
Christopher said at the dedication. The 135-member church is the 
only one of four to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	The town is rebuilding after the devastation but has lost about  
half of its population of 300. 
</P>
<P>
	For two months after the storm of May 30, 1998, Trinity's  
congregation worshipped in a tent, then moved to a garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day for all of us,'' said Peg Wubben, a church  
member. ``This building is wonderful. But any place where two or 
three gather to worship God is a church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Church of the Nazarene closed shortly after the tornado that  
killed the minister's wife; St. Matthew's Lutheran voted to disband 
in April, and St. Mary's Catholic Church joined St. Peter's Parish 
in Farmer.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Alan Wolfe, a social scientist and author, has  
been chosen to head Boston College's new Center for Religion and 
American Public Life. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe, who will become a professor of political science at the  
Jesuit-run school, said he envisions the center as a forum for 
prominent intellectuals and scholars to discuss issues such as 
cloning and euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issues of religion and morality have not been central to the  
social sciences,'' Wolfe says. ``We will attempt to fill the void 
... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe has been an instructor of political science for 33 years,  
most recently at Boston University. His books include ``One Nation 
After All.''

 *Religious building boom    	
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A boom in religious construction is under way  
across the country, according to Leadership Network, an 
organization that advises local churches on social and religious 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Its latest newsletter reported $6.4 billion in new construction  
last year, up 64 percent from 1994. The figures include new 
churches, synagogues, mosques and other religious buildings and 
additions to existing structures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early indications reveal the boom is continuing in 1999,'' the  
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	Network analysts say the reasons include church expansions in  
the past decade, especially in the South, Midwest and West Coast, 
and America's increasing religious pluralism, with nontraditional 
groups seeking their own facilities.

 *Episcopalians identify with diversity    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A survey of 2,000 members of the Episcopal  
Church indicates that diversity in belief is nearly as much a mark 
of identity as prayer book worship. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, sponsored by the Episcopal Church Foundation, is to  
be mailed to every parish. It shows that more than 95 percent of 
those interviewed believe communion and liturgical worship 
according to the Book of Common Prayer are central to their 
religious lives. 
</P>
<P>
	On diversity, 78 percent believe members bring ``a wide variety  
of perspectives'' to congregations, and an equal number said 
Episcopalians are ``more likely to ask questions than answer 
them.'' Only 54 percent believe church traditions ``clearly define 
right and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Living with questions of faith and tolerating ambiguities in  
beliefs are common patterns among many Episcopalians,'' the survey 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes these statistics: Episcopal membership has  
declined 36 percent from a peak of 3.6 million in 1967. However, 
between 1974 and 1997 average attendance rose 31 percent and the 
number of confirmed adults increased 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1991, liquid assets of all Episcopal churches have grown  
from $1 billion to $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-sex behavior and sexual morality in general are the  
church's most divisive issue, according to the report, though in 
many congregations ``these difficult questions were not the staple 
of daily life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *'Christ-centered' budgets    	
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Leaders of the Born Again Church passed  
the plate to help members pay their debts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American Dream is not God's dream for America,'' the Rev.  
Horace Hockett said. ``We want to kill the spirit of keeping up 
with the Joneses and teach people to live within their means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members were asked to put the special offering in an envelope  
and list on the back their debts -- smallest, largest and total. 
About 400 people contributed, ranging from a few dollars to a check 
for $1,900. 
</P>
<P>
	From the pool of donors, church leaders say about 15 people will  
receive about $2,000 each. Recipients must not incur new debt for a 
year and must give a church offering and testify about the power of 
God and a ``Christ-centered'' budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Again leaders believe freeing members from debt will put  
them in a better position to give to Christian causes, including 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,500-member congregation would like to build three more  
day-care operations and a new sanctuary and to increase its 
benevolence fund for local people with emergency needs.

<HEADLINE> Ryan White Foundation Close to Broke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Ryan White Foundation, established to  
promote AIDS education after the death of its 18-year-old namesake 
in 1990, is nearly broke and has laid off its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has nearly deserted its suburban Indianapolis  
offices, leaving behind a message on its toll-free phone line 
saying it is closed for lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne White-Ginder, White's mother and the group's founder,  
said donations topped $250,000 four years ago but have dwindled 
ever since. Board members also said celebrity support for the 
foundation has slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really been a hard time for the AIDS community,'' she  
said Thursday. ``People are under the misconception that the 
disease is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While its directors insist the foundation is still alive, a bin  
full of uncollected mail sat outside the office door Wednesday. 
Workers at a neighboring office said they last saw two foundation 
volunteers two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Maddox, chairman of the board, said volunteers are reading  
the mail, returning phone messages and mailing out brochures, 
though only sporadically. The board hopes to align with another 
AIDS group that has a more solid funding base. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably down to our last $1,000 right now,'' Maddox  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, a hemophiliac, contracted the AIDS virus through tainted  
blood-clotting products. He attracted national attention during his 
battle to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
	White received heaps of support from AIDS activists and  
celebrities such as Elton John, and that helped the foundation in 
its early years as it raised money for educational materials and 
Ms. White-Ginder's presentations at schools and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	But foundation leaders said the group has lost its cause celebre  
status. 
</P>
<P>
	John formed his own AIDS organization in 1991. And Margaret  
Goldsmith, a board member and the wife of Indianapolis' mayor, said 
the last time she saw foundation co-founder Phil Donahue at a Ryan 
White event was nearly five years ago.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Poll Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on Hillary Rodham Clinton is based on  
telephone interviews with 1,016 randomly selected adults from all 
states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted 
June 4-8 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll, no more than one time in 20 should chance  
variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 
percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all 
Americans were polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Is your opinion of Hillary Rodham Clinton favorable or  
unfavorable? 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable, 58 percent; unfavorable, 31 percent; don't know, 9  
percent; refused, 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. As you may know, Mrs. Clinton is deciding whether to run for  
the U.S. Senate in New York. Do you think she should run or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes should run, 54 percent; no should not run, 34 percent; don't  
know, 9 percent; refused, 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. In general, do you think it is appropriate for a president's  
spouse to run for office or do you think it is not appropriate? 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriate, 73 percent; not appropriate, 20 percent; don't  
know, 6 percent; refused, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. In your opinion, which job would allow Hillary Rodham Clinton  
to be most effective in public life after Bill Clinton leaves 
office? 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. senator, 36 percent; head of a foundation, 18 percent;  
writer and lecturer, 19 percent; lawyer, 13 percent; don't know, 12 
percent; refused, 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Is your opinion of Bill Clinton favorable or unfavorable?  
</P>
<P>
	Favorable, 48 percent; unfavorable, 44 percent; don't know, 7  
percent; refused, 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Order Targets Race Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's order for federal law  
enforcement officers to document the race and gender of those they 
arrest or detain could bring relief to travelers who have long 
complained of racial harassment in airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order Wednesday for the Treasury,  
Justice and Interior departments to develop, within 120 days, a 
plan for collecting data on the race, gender and ethnicity of 
people agency officers stop to question or arrest. Field tests on 
those plans would begin within 60 days after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have great confidence in our federal law enforcement  
officers,'' Clinton's order said. ``We cannot tolerate, however, 
officers who cross the line and abuse their position by mistreating 
law-abiding individuals or who bring their own racial bias to the 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said at a meeting of police and civil rights activists that  
while his executive order would cover ``only a fraction'' of the 
nation's law officers, he hoped it would spur state and local 
agencies to begin collecting such data, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have an obligation to move beyond anecdotes to find out  
exactly who is being stopped and why,'' Clinton said. He also 
voiced support for legislation by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to 
provide funds for states to collect similar data, a step that law 
enforcement officials generally have resisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Scully, executive director of the National Association of  
Police Organizations, which represents 4,000 police groups, said 
there already are laws to address the complaints of those claiming 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be better to invest more time in the laws already on  
the books rather than add another burden to law enforcement 
officers,'' Scully said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Shuford, the American Civil Liberties Union's lead  
attorney on so-called racial profiling cases, said Clinton's order 
would have ``a domino effect'' at the state and local levels, and 
would alleviate the problem in federal jurisdictions wherever it 
arises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever you have a predominantly white environment and there  
are people of color, they're going to be scrutinized beyond what is 
necessary. So if it's in a park, yes, it could happen in the Park 
Service,'' Shuford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuford said the order's impact will be felt at airports, where  
increasing numbers of minorities are complaining that they were 
selected for Customs searches based on their race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people travel for vacation. A lot of people take  
trips as a regular part of their jobs. Many people will come across 
federal officials in that process,'' Shuford said. ``In that 
respect, I think it can be really significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's order covers federal officers such as the police who  
patrol national parks, as well as agents with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and the Customs Service, which is facing a 
class-action lawsuit by nearly 100 black women who say they were 
singled out for searches when re-entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of this whole thing of traveling while black,  
driving while black, or brown or red,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. 
He is crafting legislation that would require that detained 
travelers have access to a lawyer within 24 hours, and that a 
magistrate approve any detention that lasts longer than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said legislation is necessary because Clinton's order does  
not address the civil liberties issues behind Customs detentions. 
He said he is responding to media reports that showed blacks made 
up 90 percent of passengers X-rayed for drugs at Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport, while only 20 percent of detained blacks 
were found to be carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The position taken by the president is long overdue. We need  
to get to the bottom of this,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials said 50,892 of 71.5 million international air  
travelers were subjected to body searches, mainly simple pat-downs, 
during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and Hispanic travelers were subjected to 43 percent of  
body searches last year, according to an analysis of Customs data 
presented to Congress earlier this year by a Cornell University law 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has appointed a panel to  
review policies and procedures used by Customs inspectors; a report 
is expected in mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Caller to Mobile Phone May Soon Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could attract more consumers to  
mobile phones, the Federal Communications Commission is proposing 
to make it easier for wireless carriers to bill callers rather than 
receivers of mobile-phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission sees the rules as a way to boost use of wireless  
phones and foster competition between providers of wireless and 
regular phone service. The rules, which the FCC hopes to have in 
place by the first quarter of 2000, would enable wireless providers 
to have callers pay for mobile phone calls just as they do with 
regular phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to introduce wireless services to a whole new class of  
consumers,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in an interview 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the receiver of a mobile-phone call -- not  
the caller -- typically pays the charges. As a result, many 
Americans switch off their phones to avoid unwanted calls. In 
Europe and Asia, however, it's the caller who usually pays. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules, which will be open for comment following the  
today's announcement, don't force wireless carriers to charge 
callers but are supposed to make it easier for them to offer the 
``calling party pays'' service. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the issues the FCC plans to address in reaching a final  
rule is how consumers would know whether they were calling a 
wireless phone, which might mean greater charges than a call to a 
regular line. 
</P>
<P>
	An option is to have a notification voice message that tells  
callers they have reached a wireless number and how much they will 
be charged after they dial a wireless phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is to have a prefix number specifically set  
aside for use with wireless phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single most important issue we have to deal with is how do  
we protect consumers,'' Kennard said. ``We want to make sure they 
know what they're getting into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the FCC will work with state regulators and consumer  
groups on how to inform customers of such a service. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies now provide some form of the caller-pays  
approach, and others have test marketed the service in certain 
states. One issue the wireless industry will have to consider is 
how to handle billing, since companies will be charging callers who 
are not their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hopes that by offering the service, wireless providers  
will be able to compete more effectively against regular telephone 
providers. Consumers might be more encouraged to use mobile phones 
-- even possibly as their primary phone -- if they do not have to pay 
to receive calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wireless phone should be a substitute, not just a complement,  
for wireline phones,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC was also expected to vote on a report today on the  
wireless industry that shows competition growing among providers, 
an increase in the number of subscribers to wireless services and 
lower prices.

<HEADLINE> Woman With AIDS To Set Out on Trail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- Dawn Averitt is packing some of the usual  
items as she starts hiking the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail: 
sleeping bag, plenty of dried noodles and macaroni, fresh socks, 
bug repellent. 
</P>
<P>
	But she's also toting a lot of medicine on her back.  
</P>
<P>
	Averitt, 30, of Raleigh, N.C., takes 28 pills and liquid  
medications every day to keep AIDS at bay. She is having her 
prescription drugs mailed to two dozen points along the trail for 
the walk from Maine to Georgia she planned to start today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be a little more precise in our planning,'' Averitt  
said on the eve of her hike up mile-high Mount Katahdin, the 
trail's northern terminus and the starting point for what she 
anticipates will be a six-month trek. 
</P>
<P>
	For Averitt, this ``very personal journey'' represents the  
fulfillment of a childhood dream and an affirmation that people 
with AIDS can take on big challenges and meet them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,500 prospective ``thru-hikers'' set out on the trail  
each of the past three years, but only 300 completed the trip, said 
Brian King of the Appalachian Trail Conference in Harpers Ferry, 
W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who have done it include a blind man, diabetics, people  
with kidney transplants and a man with multiple sclerosis who hiked 
the trail three times, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Regimbal, 27, of Bar Harbor set out from Katahdin two  
years ago, using the trail name ``Positive Woman,'' a reference to 
her HIV status. But she became sick and had to leave the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	Averitt, the founding director of an advocacy organization for  
women with AIDS, will be accompanied by her brother, a friend and 
her dog, who carries his own food in a red pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of hikers travel from south to north. Averitt  
chose to end in her native Stone Mountain, Ga., in hopes of 
arriving in time to spend Thanksgiving with her family in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Averitt traces her disease to a 1988 sexual assault in Spain  
when she was 19. Six months later, she tested positive for HIV and 
was diagnosed with full-blown AIDS five years after that. 
</P>
<P>
	After working for two years in the Washington press office of  
U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, Averitt returned to Atlanta and founded the 
Women's Information Service and Exchange, a nonprofit organization 
that provides treatment information and advocacy for women with 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Averitt's latest project is the Living Well Fund, an  
organization that helps identify innovative grassroots projects 
worthy of financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes her upcoming journey will show AIDS is not a death  
sentence and that people can live well, regardless of the 
challenges they face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mine happens to be AIDS, but everybody has challenges,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Canoeist's Profanity Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- A jury was selected today in the trial of  
Timothy Boomer -- who, if he had a better sense of balance, might 
not be in this kind of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	There he was, paddling along in a canoe for the first time, when  
he struck a rock and was unceremoniously dumped into the Rifle 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	What he subsequently hollered that day last summer is now the  
subject of a criminal trial that pits free-speech advocates against 
prosecutors who want to limit public use of offensive language. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's deputy says he heard Boomer explode in a barrage of  
profanity, loud enough to be heard a quarter-mile away. Within 
earshot was Tammy Smith, 32, who was canoeing with husband Michael, 
32, her 5-year-old son, Casey, and her 2-year-old daughter, 
Samantha. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury of four women and three men was selected this morning.  
One panelist will serve as an alternate. Opening statements were to 
begin after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer William Street asked potential jurors if they  
were uncomfortable with foul language, ``including the f-word in 
all its glory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people said they ignore bad language, or leave if possible.  
</P>
<P>
	Boomer was ticketed with violating a 102-year-old Michigan law  
that makes cursing in the presence of women and children punishable 
with up to 90 days in jail or a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people think that morals and respect for each other  
don't matter any more,'' says Ladd White, who runs a canoe shop 
along the river. ``That's been the downfall of societies in the 
past. Maybe this will send a message that morality does matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer, an auto supply worker from the Detroit suburb of  
Roseville, was with friends on the winding, tree-lined river about 
130 miles north of Detroit when his canoe hit the rock. 
</P>
<P>
	After tumbling out, Boomer admits he let off steam, but denies  
he used the four-letter obscenities that police allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Richard Vollbach says the case involves no lofty  
constitutional issues. Instead, he says, it's a simple matter of 
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went on a three-minute profanity tirade in front of a  
2-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy,'' Vollbach said. ``The mother 
literally covered the ears of her daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer refuses to repeat the words he used, but insists they've  
been exaggerated. He says he didn't see anyone but his friends and 
that his shouts were in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never asked for any of this,'' Boomer said earlier this  
year. ``But I decided to fight this law because ... I just believe 
it's a violation of freedom of speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Street, handling the case on behalf of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, says the 1897 law is rarely enforced because 
police know it is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Belle, O's Mgr. in Shouting Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sullen slugger Albert Belle faced possible  
disciplinary measures by the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday after 
engaging in a shouting match with manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Belle yelled at Miller and had to be restrained  
by teammates after being removed from Wednesday night's 4-2 win 
over the Florida Marlins in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like that happen on the bench or in the clubhouse,  
those are the type things we deal with internally,'' Orioles 
general manager Frank Wren said in Atlanta, where the Orioles had 
an off-day before a weekend series with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year, $65 million free-agent deal with  
the Orioles in December, has been suspended six times during his 
career and is well-known for his disdain of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear what, if any, disciplinary measures would be  
taken against Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was said and what was done is an internal matter,'' Wren  
said, adding that Miller ``isn't going to say anymore about it, 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could not be reached for comment Thursday. A call to his  
Atlanta hotel room was answered by an unidentified person, who hung 
up when the reporter identified himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred in the top of the ninth inning in the  
Orioles dugout after Belle, who went 0-for-5 in the game, failed to 
run out a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
	With two runners on and two outs in the ninth and the Orioles  
leading 4-2, Belle grounded to Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell. 
Belle slowed up halfway to first, but Lowell's throw pulled first 
baseman Kevin Millar off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller replaced Belle in the outfield with Rich Amaral on a  
double switch, a move he said he had planned to make before Belle's 
groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amaral knew he was going in if Albert made the last out when  
the inning started,'' Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was unaware of the move until he was on his way to his  
outfield position, eventually jogging back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout, TV cameras caught an exchange of expletives  
between Miller and Belle. Belle yelled angrily at Miller and was 
restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. Miller waved Belle off with a 
toss of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My comment is that what happens internally will stay internal  
and will be taken care of internally,'' Miller said. ``What goes on 
between me and anybody stays in the clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, approached by reporters after the game, responded with a  
stream of expletives. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, struggling with a .244 batting average, has hit only one  
home run in his last 21 games. The Orioles, with a $78.5 million 
payroll, are the most disappointing team in baseball with a 22-36 
record and there has been speculation that Miller's job is in 
jeopardy.

	Jobless Claims Jump by 14,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits shot up last week to the highest level since 
early January. The Labor Department reported today that 323,000 
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits last week, up by 
14,000 from the previous week. The increase was unexpected. 
Analysts had expected the number of claims for unemployment 
benefits to inch down slightly. Government analysts noted that the 
reporting period included the Memorial Day holiday. Weeks including 
a holiday have often been erratic in terms of the number of people 
showing up in benefit claims offices.

	Japan Economy Shows Signs of Growth  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy grew a surprisingly robust 1.9  
percent in the first three months of the year, largely because of 
increased public spending, the government announced today. The 
increase in gross domestic product is the first since the summer of 
1997 and marked an end -- although perhaps only temporary -- to the 
nation's longest recession since World War II. ``Nobody expected 
such high numbers,'' said Akio Yoshino, director of Credit Suisse 
Asset Management in Tokyo. ``Japan's prolonged contraction in the 
economy has at last bottomed.'' Economists in Tokyo had expected, 
on average, a 0.1 percent contraction. Japan's GDP shrank 1.2 
percent in the January-March quarter of 1998.

	Bank of England Cuts Interest Rate  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England lowered its base lending rate  
by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent today in hopes of 
further encouraging economic growth. The cut, announced after the 
monthly meeting of the bank's monetary committee, resumes a process 
of incremental monthly reductions in the base rate for loans to 
banks. The Bank of England decided in April to hold the base 
lending rate steady at 5.25 percent after having cut it for seven 
consecutive months. The committee based the latest reduction on its 
assessment that Britain's inflation rate was likely to come in 
below the government's targeted level of 2.5 percent, the bank 
said.

	Cathay Pacific, Pilots Reach Deal

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways and its pilots reached a  
deal today that will cut the cockpit crew's pay in exchange for 
stock options and end a dispute that has grounded hundreds of 
flights. The agreement was reached less than 24 hours before the 
company was threatening to fire its pilots. ``There are no winners 
or losers,'' said John Findlay, general secretary of the Hong Kong 
Aircrew Officers Association. ``This is a victory for common sense, 
for the people and the economy of Hong Kong.''

	Airlines Draft Customer Service Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's major airlines are drafting a  
plan for better treatment of their passengers, a voluntary move 
aimed at holding off more serious mandatory directives from 
Congress. One part of the 12-point plan, a draft of which was 
obtained yesterday by The Associated Press, would commit airlines 
to meeting customers' essential needs during long, on-aircraft 
delays. That would include making ``every reasonable effort to 
provide food, water, restroom facilities and access to medical 
treatment.''

	Asian Stock Prices Rise

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares finished mostly higher today, with  
the big Tokyo market surging ahead despite concerns that U.S. 
interest rates might be on the way up. Prices in Seoul jumped more 
than 6 percent to a nearly two-year high. Hong Kong blue chips 
bucked the trend, retreating modestly late in the session, despite 
an earlier rally on news that mainland China had trimmed interest 
rates. In Tokyo, shares soared 2.9 percent to their highest level 
in a month on optimism that Japan's economy might finally be 
recovering. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 480.12 points 
to 17,102.62. It was the Nikkei's highest finish since May 6, when 
it closed at 17,300.61.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The morning after she faced protesters with  
``carpetbagger go home'' signs, Hillary Rodham Clinton said today 
she hasn't yet secured a New York residence to use for a Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going around collecting offers of people's guest rooms and  
extra beds and pull-out couches,'' she said on NBC's ``Today 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the morning television appearance, Mrs. Clinton, schools  
chancellor Rudy Crew and jazz great Wynton Marsalis announced the 
donation of $1 million worth of musical instruments to the city's 
public schools. The donation was organized by the music television 
channel VH1's Save the Music program, which raises money and 
solicits donations from instrument manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have young people in a gang called a band than any  
other kind of gang,'' the first lady told about 500 people in the 
auditorium of Public School 72 in East Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton and Crew both referred to theories about a direct  
correlation between music education and student performance in math 
and other subjects. ``Music is a way for young people to understand 
their entire world,'' Crew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsalis said, ``I'm not talking about something that will make  
your math great and your science great. ... The important thing 
about music is that it raises the soul quotient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Today'' show and VH1 are asking Americans to donate  
instruments to the effort. Mrs. Clinton accepted several 
instruments that were brought to the show by viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady -- on her 11th trip to New York and her first  
since she announced she would form an exploratory committee to 
consider a run for the Senate -- denied news reports that she's 
buying or leasing a home in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard so many stories about apartments and houses that  
I've bought and I only wish that were true, but that hasn't 
happened yet,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked whether she was bound to make the race now that  
Rep. Nita Lowey, the only other Democrat publicly mulling a run for 
the Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
has bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a Democrat will win this Senate race and I'm looking  
forward to going out and listening to New Yorkers and just having a 
good time, to be honest,'' Mrs. Clinton replied. On the stops she 
made in Binghamton and in New York City Wednesday, she said, ``I 
learned a lot, I saw a lot of people and I had a great experience 
and I'm going to be doing a lot of that in July and August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She took a jab at Republicans, saying the way they've handled  
gun control legislation this week only proves that the Democratic 
Party ``is much more in touch with the mainstream -- not only of 
America, but particularly of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With about three dozen demonstrators shouting from across the  
street outside a Lockheed Martin plant she had visited near 
Binghamton, Mrs. Clinton told reporters Wednesday that such 
protests were simply a ``fact of political life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, born in Illinois and a former first lady of  
Arkansas, has never lived or worked in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate race could pit Mrs. Clinton against Republican New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who formed an exploratory committee in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	After a visit Wednesday to a Lockheed Martin plant, Mrs. Clinton  
attended a fund-raiser for Rep. Maurice Hinchey at a Binghamton 
hotel. A dozen or so protesters demonstrated outside, and office 
building windows overlooking the hotel were adorned with several 
anti-Clinton signs. One read: ``Hillary Clinton is not qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton then flew to New York City for a $5,000-a-person  
dinner organized by financial writer Andrew Tobias at a private 
home. The event, aimed at gay and lesbian campaign contributors, 
was expected to raise at least $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Pushes Europe, Japan on Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japan's economic growth spurt earlier this  
year does not lessen the need for the world's second largest 
economy to continue efforts to emerge from its worst recession in 
50 years, the Clinton administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told reporters the risk that the  
Asian currency crisis will trigger a global recession ``has very 
substantially diminished.'' But, Rubin said, world growth remained 
too lopsided with the United States the only major economy now 
doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong U.S. growth and weak performance elsewhere has pushed  
America's trade deficit to all-time highs, triggering protectionist 
pressures and political headaches for the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the need for more balanced global growth would come  
up in talks this weekend in Germany with finance ministers from the 
world's seven leading industrial countries -- the United States, 
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is ... critically important that Europe and Japan do their  
part because the international system cannot sustain indefinitely 
the large imbalances created by the disparities in growth and 
openness between the United States and its major trading 
partners,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan reported Thursday that its economy, which has been mired  
in recession for more than a year, managed to show an unexpected 
spurt of growth in the first three months of this year, an increase 
of 1.9 percent that reflected massive public works spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin played down the significance, saying Japan still faced  
challenges in sustaining economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to have in place policies that promote strong  
domestic demand-led growth,'' Rubin said. ``That remains critically 
important for Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Saturday's discussions were aimed at preparing the  
agenda for the June 18-20 meetings of President Clinton and leaders 
of the other G-7 countries and Russia at their annual economic 
summit in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Developments in Kosovo probably will dominate those talks,  
including what donor countries will be willing to contribute to 
reconstruction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said that Europe, the United States, Japan and the  
international lending agencies such as the World Bank would all 
play a role in that effort but that the Cologne meeting would not 
come up with a formal plan on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic summit also will review efforts to deal with the  
nearly two-year-long global financial crisis, including proposals 
to overhaul the financial architecture to make future Asian-style 
currency crises less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the G-7 finance ministers hope to put forward a  
``package of concrete proposals'' for the leaders to consider. But 
he did not indicate there would be any significant new measures 
beyond current efforts in such areas as boosting financial 
disclosure by developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-7 nations have been unable to resolve a number of  
differences on approach, especially on ways to make sure rich 
investors do not get bailed out when international rescue packages 
are put together. 
</P>
<P>
	The wealthy countries also remain split on the best approach to  
reduce the heavy debt burdens of the world's poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Settles Ohio Radiation Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMISBURG, Ohio (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Energy has  
settled a lawsuit by hundreds of nuclear weapons plant employees 
who say they were exposed to dangerous radiation and not told about 
it for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The department agreed to pay lifetime health insurance coverage  
for as many as 1,800 current and former workers at the Mound 
nuclear plant in the Dayton suburbs. The deal, subject to approval 
by a federal judge, is expected to cost several million dollars, 
depending on insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal requires the Energy Department to provide the coverage  
to Mound workers who contract any of several types of cancer, 
including brain, nervous system, bladder, bone, lung, pancreatic, 
digestive and oral cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant began operating in 1948 and made triggers and  
detonators for nuclear weapons. The Energy Department has halted 
those operations to focus on cleaning up waste at the site, which 
officials want to convert into an office park. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve employees and the Oil, Chemical &AMP; Atomic Workers union  
filed the lawsuit in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing. Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson said it is intended to address the 
workers' worries about what radiation exposure may have done to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were former plant operator EG&AMP;G Mound Applied  
Technologies Inc. and its predecessor, Monsanto Research Corp. The 
Energy Department provided the plant contract.

<HEADLINE> A City Divided: White Sox Vs. Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs pitcher Terry Mulholland usually can  
tell right away if someone is a Cubs fan or a White Sox fan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cubs fan will say hello, maybe shake his hand and talk for a  
little. A White Sox fan will give him the once-over and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
	It's nothing personal. But in Chicago, a person is either a  
White Sox or Cubs fan. There's no switching allegiances and no 
rooting for both teams. And there's definitely no fraternizing with 
the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go into that series, you know it's more than just  
playing another team as far as fans are concerned,'' Mulholland 
said. ``You know people in the stands are hyped up. They have 
greater expectations than most other games so it adds to the 
electricity of the ball park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Williams, a Hall of Famer with the Cubs who's now the  
team's dugout coach, says the rivalry is ``just like 
Alabama-Auburn. You can lose to anybody, but don't lose to the Sox. 
I guess they say the same things over there with the White Sox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, split  
their allegiances because they want to have something to fight 
about,'' Williams said. ``It's a rivalry for bragging rights for 
the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which makes this one of the best weekends of the year for  
Chicago baseball fans. Or one of the worst, depending on one's 
loyalty. The first of two Crosstown Series begins Friday at Wrigley 
Field, so Cubs and White Sox fans will be arguing loudly for three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's got the better team, the Kiddie Corps or the Geezers?  
Who's a better power hitter, Frank Thomas or Sammy Sosa? Whose 
bullpen is more dangerous -- and that's not a compliment these days 
-- and which pitcher has the best stuff? Which field is better, 
Wrigley or Comiskey Park? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a city divided for almost a century,'' Cubs first  
baseman Mark Grace said. ``Fans get into it and there will be great 
arguments all around the pubs for that week. It's good stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even for the players, though their passions don't run nearly as  
deep as their fans. They say there's no animosity between the 
teams. Sosa even wore a White Sox uniform for a few seasons, while 
White Sox pitcher Jaime Navarro had some of his best years on the 
North Side. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to this series, there's something special,  
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be three days of almost 50,000 or whatever you  
can get in the ballpark,'' he said. ``It's not a bitter rivalry. 
It's more, `We think we've got a better team than you,' and that's 
just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has played for the White Sox his entire career and knows  
exactly what he's in for this weekend. But the rest of the South 
Siders might not. The White Sox have the second-youngest team in 
the majors, and manager Jerry Manuel said it's tough for them to 
fully appreciate the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, they know bragging rights for the Windy City are at stake  
and they've been told repeatedly how much it means to the fans. But 
just wait until they get to Wrigley on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The South Side and North Side fans don't like each other and  
they get into that series,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs and White Sox have played each other often through the  
years, with the White Sox having a 120-82-6 advantage. But most of 
the games were in spring training or exhibitions, so they don't 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to interleague play, however, they do now. The White Sox  
won the 1997 series at Comiskey and the Cubs responded last year 
with a 3-0 sweep at Wrigley. And this year? 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the way I look at it, they should beat us because  
of the inexperience of this team and they have a veteran team,'' 
Thomas said. ``But you never know what might happen. There's a lot 
of teams supposed to beat us and we're holding our own.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Vote on Y2K Litigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate was moving toward passage of  
legislation to protect businesses from being broadsided by lawsuits 
arising from computers tainted by the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate bill, a compromise between Republicans and  
Democrats that has been months in the making, faces a tough future, 
criticized on the one hand by House members who say it is too weak 
and on the other by the Clinton administration, which says it is 
too strong and will be vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with  
the help of Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher 
Dodd of Connecticut, would give companies 90 days to fix Y2K 
glitches before lawsuits can be filed and would encourage 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It would limit class action lawsuits, ensure that most companies  
are liable only for the proportion of the damage they cause and set 
punitive damage caps for companies with 50 or fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to pass this responsible legislation would be like  
sticking a monkey wrench in the high-tech engine that is driving 
our economic prosperity,'' Wyden said. Business leaders who have 
actively lobbied for the bill have said it is their top legislative 
priority for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, possible today or Friday, the bill would have to  
be reconciled with a House-passed version that is stronger in 
protecting defendants from lawsuits and supporters would have to 
deal with the White House veto threat. The administration says the 
Senate bill, while better than the House alternative, still goes 
too far in curbing a consumer's legal rights to seek damages for 
economic losses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday the Senate defeated, 57-41, a substitute version  
offered by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that was acceptable to the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's measure, while similar in most respects to McCain's,  
would have exempted individual consumers from the limits set by the 
legislation, eliminated all punitive damage caps and applied 
proportionate damage -- holding companies responsible only for their 
share of damage caused -- only to defendants that had alerted users 
to Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to exempt consumers  
from the bill was also defeated, 65-32. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone Democrat to speak out against the need for lawsuit  
controls was Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Hollings said 
trial lawyers and punitive damage awards are essential to consumer 
interests in America and linked enthusiasm for a litigation bill to 
the political contributions of the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Valley has got the money and people are falling over  
pell-mell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 96.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Reach Deal on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House gave divided blessings Thursday to a  
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo after Republicans extracted a 
written promise from President Clinton that it could be performed 
``without harming military readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a 270-155 vote, the House removed from a $288.8 billion  
defense spending bill a GOP-drafted provision that would have 
barred U.S. funds from being used in Kosovo after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came moments after Clinton, in a letter to all House  
members, promised to seek congressional authorization for an 
international peacekeeping force expected to include 7,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee and the author of the provision that had drawn a 
presidential veto threat, announced the letter would allow him to 
support the effort by Democrats to strip the provision from the 
defense bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall defense bill -- minus the Kosovo restrictions -- was  
passed later on a 365-58 vote. It contains a 4.8 percent military 
pay raise for the year 2000 and measures to beef up security at the 
nation's nuclear labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress would be the laughing stock of the world,'' if the  
legislation with the restrictions had passed, just a day after the 
dramatic Kosovo peace agreement, said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, 
the senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton led the effort to strike the offending language from the  
spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing to remove the restriction on Kosovo funds, the House  
averted what Democrats contended could have been an embarrassing 
predicament on a day when the peace plan was being widely 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Republicans persisted in demanding that Congress  
restrict spending for Kosovo, arguing it was draining other 
military accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	And, even despite Clinton's conciliatory gesture, 142  
Republicans voted to keep the fund cutoff provision in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new and perhaps more troubling phase for our  
country,'' Spence said earlier in a day of tense debate. 
``Administration policy has been contentious and confusing, not 
only for Congress but for the American people as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton said the president told him he ``fully intends'' to send  
a request to Congress well before Sept. 30 to formally seek funds 
for the peacekeeping operation. He made a similar promise in a 
phone conversation with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said he should put it in writing, however.  
</P>
<P>
	And late Thursday afternoon, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, he said he had directed a detailed review to be  
made of the costs of the peacekeeping operation -- and that he would 
send to Congress ``in a timely manner'' specific legislation 
seeking approval of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton said the request would be submitted well before the  
Sept. 30 end of the present fiscal year. More importantly, Clinton 
promised the money wouldn't come from other parts of the Pentagon's 
budget and could be spent ``without harming military readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed to ease the concern of many Republicans, who said  
they were afraid the peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo would further 
strain an already stretched Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter ``changed the landscape,'' said John Feehery, a  
spokesman for Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said the peacekeeping operation  
is likely to cost U.S. taxpayers $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart called the effort by  
Republicans to withhold funds from Kosovo ``a classic case of 
trying to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many House Republicans have been critical of the  
administration's Kosovo policy. In late April, the House declined 
on a tie vote to even support the air campaign that was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusing the House of erratic behavior on Kosovo in the past,  
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told colleagues, ``Now 
we have an opportunity to win the peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some top Republicans conceded they had mixed feelings.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible time to pull the plug. This is not the time  
to give signals of uncertainty,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But, on the other hand, he questioned why Clinton hadn't  
specifically asked Congress for funds apart from the Pentagon's 
regular budget to pay for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're doing no favor to the cause of international stability  
by weakening the rest of the military to pay for something that is 
going on in Kosovo,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other votes, the House approved an amendment to allow  
military troops to assist federal law enforcement in drug 
interdiction and terrorism at U.S. border areas. It was the third 
year in a row the House passed the amendment by Rep. James 
Traficant, D-Ohio, but in the past it died in negotiations with the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	It also approved a measure allowing members of the military to  
put part of their pay into 401(k) type investment plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying bill would also authorize a 4.8 percent military  
pay raise for 2000, up from the 4.4 percent one proposed by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It also contains amendments approved on Wednesday that would  
beef up security at the nation's nuclear labs and demand a 
withdrawal of U.S. forces from Haiti by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure will next have to be reconciled with a Senate-passed  
version, which contains many of the same provisions -- although 
without the restrictive language on Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Energy Rejects Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- A unanimous vote by Columbia Energy Group's  
board of directors to reject NiSource Inc.'s unsolicited $5.7 
billion buyout offer wasn't enough to send NiSource packing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're assessing all of our options now,'' NiSource spokeswoman  
Maria Hibbs said Thursday after Columbia Energy announced its 
decision. ``... The key point is we're not going to go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy contends it isn't for sale.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the future of Columbia as an independent public  
company,'' Columbia Energy chairman, president and chief executive 
Oliver G. Richard III wrote in a letter to NiSource chairman and 
CEO Gary Neale. ``Our decision not to pursue your proposal is 
final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Richard, Columbia Energy obtained an opinion from  
Salomon Smith Barney ``that the proposed consideration is 
inadequate.'' He said Columbia Energy's board was committed to 
preventing another company from taking advantage of a ``current 
anomaly'' in which the Virginia company's stock value doesn't 
reflect its true earnings potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy's shares closed Thursday up 18 3/4 cents to $62 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Merrillville, Ind.-based NiSource made a hostile bid  
of $68 cash for each share in Columbia Energy. The proposed buyout 
would have made NiSource, the parent company of Northern Indiana 
Public Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts, one of 
the nation's biggest natural gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon, Va., had 1998 revenues of  
nearly $6.6 billion. It is involved in natural gas exploration, 
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Columbia Energy attempted to buy Pittsburgh-based  
Consolidated Natural Gas. But CNG last month rejected the offer to 
proceed with an already-planned merger with Richmond, Va.-based 
Dominion Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Neale had said he hoped shareholder pressure within Columbia  
Energy would force its board to negotiate. At least three 
class-action shareholder lawsuits were filed to get talks going, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Columbia has sophisticated shareholders who understand the  
value of their investment and they told us clearly they wanted 
management to meet with NiSource,'' Ms. Hibbs said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Americans Seek Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House panel that deals with  
the census says it's time that all Americans who live overseas are 
included in the population counts done every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only U.S. government employees and their dependents who live  
outside of the United States are counted in the census because 
records of their whereabouts are available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau has no plan to include other U.S. citizens  
overseas in the count that begins in April, and a coalition of 
groups representing those Americans wants that changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., also wants them to be counted.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to come up with a way to count overseas citizens,'' he  
said Wednesday at a hearing of his House Government Reform census 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They vote and they pay taxes, a lot of them, and they have  
every right to be counted. We need to find a way to do it, 
certainly for 2010,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census 2000 Coalition has a plan to include them in the next  
census that is similar to the post card system overseas Americans 
use to vote by absentee ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director, said it was too  
late to change the 2000 census without jeopardizing its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff from the bureau recently discussed the plan with coalition  
representatives but concluded that the agency ``cannot credibly 
enumerate the population of American citizens living abroad,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are concerns about how to correct invalid responses  
as well as how to conduct what essentially would be a worldwide 
count, Prewitt added. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the number of private American citizens living in  
other countries range from 3 million to 10 million, various 
witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucy Laederich, president of the Federation of American Women's  
Clubs Overseas Inc., said excluding them from the census means they 
aren't part of the count that is used to redistribute the 435 seats 
in the House after every census. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans abroad accounted for 4 percent of the 1996 vote, she  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We care enough to vote and we care enough to assist others in  
voting, and yet the great numbers of overseas Americans are not 
taken into account in the distribution of voting districts,'' she 
told Miller in a letter. ``We believe that it is unbelievably 
unjust to forget these Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt said the bureau tried counting them in 1960 and 1970,  
but was disappointed with the results. He did not rule out future 
counts, however, and told Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the 
panel's top Democrat, that he would support legislation she is 
drafting for a census in 2003 of private Americans overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said Maloney's effort, if enacted, could lay the  
groundwork for including Americans in the census conducted in 2010.

<HEADLINE> Black Jockeys Were 1st Pro Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Writes    	
</P>
<P>
	Ed Hotaling doesn't buy the common belief that baseball players  
in the 1840s were the first pro athletes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The first pro athletes were black jockeys, ``who were riding  
before George Washington's days,'' Hotaling said in an interview 
about his recent book, ``The Great Black Jockeys: The Lives and 
Times of the Men Who Dominated America's First National Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hotaling was angered when he was told by someone involved with  
the National Hall of Fame of Racing that the first black race 
riders weren't professionals because they were slaves and were told 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real jockeys because they wore uniforms,'' Hotaling  
said. ``I found descriptions of uniforms they wore in the late 
1600s'' that were documented in newspaper called the South Carolina 
Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were professionals because it was their job,'' said  
Hotaling, a writer and producer for the NBC television station in 
Washington, who became interested in black jockeys while writing a 
history of racing at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The skill of slave jockeys and trainers enabled them to cross  
state lines, which was a rigidly enforced taboo of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Great Black Jockeys'' covers their rise and demise and in  
so doing follows the course of racing from the 17th century to the 
early years of the 20th century. There are about 12 black jockeys 
currently riding, none on the highest level, according to Hotaling. 
</P>
<P>
	Black race riders were gradually forced out in this century as  
the sport became more lucrative, Jim Crow laws were enforced and 
blacks migrated to cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until the Civil War, racing was bigger in the South than in  
the more puritanical North, and that is why many of the jockeys and 
trainers were slaves, although there were white jockeys and 
trainers. 
</P>
<P>
	It often was plantation owner vs. plantation owner in a match  
race, but such events drew crowds and race meetings developed. Such 
events were well documented. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners kept track of results because they would sell their  
horses later,'' Hotaling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotaling documents the famous black jockeys such as Isaac  
Murphy, Willie Simms, Jimmy Winkfield, Lonnie Clayton and James 
``Soup'' Perkins, all major stars in the late 1800s and the early 
part of this century. Murphy won the Kentucky Derby in 1884 and in 
1890-91. Simms won the Derby in 1896 and 1898 in his only tries. 
Winkfield won the race in 1901-02. 
</P>
<P>
	The last black to ride in the Derby was Henry King, who was 10th  
in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more interesting are Hotaling's tales about slave jockeys  
named Cornelius, Simon and Jesse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornelius rode the great Boston to 18 wins in 19 races in  
1836-38 at tracks like the Union Course on New York's Long Island. 
All of the races were in three or four-mile heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon became a major racing figure in the 1790s and early 1800s.  
</P>
<P>
	As for Jesse, Hotaling writes, ```Hold him, Jesse,' shouted the  
president of the United Sates, Andrew Jackson. Jesse couldn't have 
weighed much more than a hundred pounds, but he was at the controls 
of a 1,000-pound thoroughbred stallion. Jesse was a slave at the 
White House -- and a professional athlete, a rider for the 
president's racing stable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Great Black Jockeys'' was published this year by Forum.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks, Kings Fined Over Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings were  
fined $25,000 each by the NBA on Thursday for salary-cap 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Nelson, coach and general manager of the Mavericks, arranged  
for Gary Trent, his fiancee, their infant son, Trent's parents and 
his fiancee's mother to spend a week at his Maui, Hawaii, vacation 
home last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings recently provided several players with an  
expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said he hoped the vacation would serve as a goodwill  
gesture to the 6-foot-8, 250-pound Trent, whom the Mavericks are 
aggressively trying to re-sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent averaged 16 points and 7.8 rebounds this season and was  
third in the balloting for the league's Most Improved Player award. 
His salary this season was $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson has not been bashful in efforts to persuade Trent to  
remain in Dallas. But the Mavericks can't exceed the salary cap to 
re-sign him, so they are limited to paying Trent no more than $5 
million over the next two years. A team can exceed the salary cap 
in re-signing a player only if he has been on the roster three or 
more seasons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Serb Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is ``very upbeat, very  
satisfied with a job well done,'' the White House said today as 
Serb troops began withdrawing from Kosovo and NATO suspended 
airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 4,000 heavily armed U.S. troops moved toward the  
shattered Balkan province. The U.S. Marines and Army soldiers 
converging on Kosovo's borders are to begin keeping the peace once 
a newly signed agreement takes hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who was expected to spend the day conferring by  
telephone with world leaders, ``is very upbeat, very satisfied with 
a job well done by NATO forces -- both military and diplomatic,'' 
said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``But also, the president does understand the job that's ahead  
of us as far as implementing this plan and beginning the process of 
returning refugees to their homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was in the Oval Office, on the phone with British  
Prime Minister Tony Blair, when national security adviser Sandy 
Berger came in and announced NATO was satisfied with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic's early troop withdrawals and was 
ready to suspend its bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is to travel Friday to Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo.,  
home of the B-2 bombers that flew long-range missions to 
Yugoslavia, to thank U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that one MUP unit has left'' Kosovo, Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said this morning, referring to the special 
police forces of the Yugoslav and Serbian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. ``We'd like to see a lot more flow'' of troops across the 
border out of Kosovo, the spokesman added. He said the police unit 
departed the war-torn Serb province at about 7 a.m. EDT, several 
hours later than NATO had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Serb withdrawal is under way, the U.N. Security  
Council will consider a resolution authorizing entry of a 
50,000-strong, NATO-commanded peacekeeping force into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 2,000 Marines aboard ships in the Aegean Sea moved ashore  
in Greece today at about dawn local time before heading overland to 
Macedonia to spearhead the entry into Kosovo. At the same time, 200 
Army troops were to begin flying to Macedonia from U.S. bases in 
Germany, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Pentagon officials said today that 1,700 Army troops, part  
of an Apache armored helicopter force that has yet to see combat in 
Kosovo, moved by road today from Albania into Macedonia to assemble 
at Camp Able Sentry, the staging area for peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial contingent of U.S. peacekeepers, which will enter  
Kosovo after the first British forces, will have tanks and other 
heavy armor, attack helicopters and other weaponry. Bacon said it 
probably would take at least 24 hours after Serb troops begin 
withdrawing before the lead elements of the U.S. peacekeeping force 
could enter Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already we are moving our forces to be prepared to go in very  
quickly, so that there will not be any kind of a significant gap 
between Serb forces leaving and the ... (peacekeepers) going in,'' 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mines will be a chief concern for peacekeepers, along with  
snipers and Serb military stragglers, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	After 78 days of NATO bombing, Yugoslav generals signed a  
military pact Wednesday that laid important ground rules for the 
end of hostilities. Tens of thousands of Serb troops will leave 
Kosovo using approved routes and under a strict timetable, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Serbs live up to what they have signed, this will end  
the killing and begin the peace,'' Cohen told a Pentagon news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The military-technical agreement signed in Macedonia Wednesday  
gives Serb troops 11 days to complete a three-stage withdrawal of 
all military and police forces. NATO originally had sought a 
seven-day pullout. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 40,000 Serb army, police and paramilitary  
forces in Kosovo, where the pre-bombing population of 2.1 million 
was 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Kosovo is the southernmost province 
of Serbia, the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO began bombing to try to halt alleged Serb atrocities  
against Kosovo residents of Albanian ancestry. NATO planes have 
flown more than 34,000 missions over Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO will monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces in a number of  
ways, including by flying reconnaissance planes and drones. 
</P>
<P>
	Within three days, all Yugoslav aircraft and air defense weapons  
must withdraw at least 15 miles outside Kosovo's borders, and 
within two days the Yugoslav authorities must provide NATO with 
records and locations of all mines and other explosive devices they 
placed in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the United States will patrol a section of  
southeastern Kosovo with a force of 7,000 Army troops. That force 
will comprise the main American contribution to a 50,000-strong 
NATO-commanded peacekeeping force, dubbed KFOR, to move into Kosovo 
as Serb troops depart. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term U.S. contingent, dubbed Task Force Falcon, will be  
made up of forces stationed at U.S. bases in Germany. It will 
replace Marine and Army troops sent in to secure the province in 
the first days and weeks of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take about 30 days to move the 7,000 soldiers and  
equipment from Germany, Bacon said.

	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- Quindaro Boulevard, with its rundown  
houses and abandoned businesses, developed a reputation as a haven 
for prostitutes, drug pushers and gangs. But this blighted 
community, once known as a promised land for runaway slaves from 
Missouri, has become a symbol of hope again. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nation of Islam -- not to be confused with the Nation  
of Islam and its controversial leader Louis Farrakhan -- has moved 
several new businesses into the neighborhood. The drug dealers, 
gang members and street walkers have moved out. 
</P>
<P>
	With names such as ``Your Diner,'' ``Your Supermarket,'' and  
``Your Service Station,'' the Islamic group hopes the businesses 
will help transform the long-neglected area into a viable 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nation of Islam's businesses are a bright spot in  
dismal surroundings. Each has a red banner with Muslim symbols of a 
star and crescent moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The doors to the United Nation of Islam establishments aren't  
open just for fellow Muslims. Anyone can eat at the diner or get 
gas at the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that we have says 'your' on it. It's not for us,  
but for everyone who reads the sign,'' said Laota Rassoull, a 
member of the denomination. ``These ideas were designed 
specifically for the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who are interested can work at the United Nation of Islam  
businesses, but there is no payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The establishments are run by volunteers who want to learn  
business skills. Those wanting to learn to make bread and pastries 
can work in the bakery. Would-be builders can volunteer at the 
United Nation of Islam's construction company. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses serve as a model for similar locations planned  
throughout the country, said James 2X, the group's national 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and  
Kansas City, Kan., say they are glad the group brought its plan to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take more than the government's interference to  
clean up these areas,'' said John J. Mendez, director of 
neighborhood and regional affairs for the Unified Government. 
``It's going to take a partnership with many groups like the United 
Nation of Islam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City -- Kansas' second largest city and one of its poorest  
and most dangerous -- was chosen four years ago as the model project 
because of its central location, 2X said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nation of Islam also has a sandwich shop in Wichita  
and health and information centers in the Washington, D.C., area. 
Its national headquarters is in Temple Hills, Md. The group farms 
tomatoes, wheat, squash and watermelon in Maryland which are 
shipped to Kansas City and distributed to needy communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The spiritual head of the United Nation of Islam is a man named  
Solomon, who was a member of the Nation of Islam before its leader, 
Elijah Muhammad, died in 1975. The Nation of Islam splintered after 
Muhammad's death, and one of the resulting groups is headed by 
Farrakhan. About 6 million Americans are Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
	2X won't say how many people belong to the United Nation of  
Islam, which teaches from the Bible, the Koran and ``the open book 
of nature.'' While many of its practices are similar to those of 
the Nation of Islam, he says, there are differences. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he said, his group avoids pork for health reasons.  
``If you asked them (members of the Nation of Islam) why they don't 
eat pork they might say, `Because it says not to eat swine in the 
Koran.' But why? We operate on the why aspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	2X is often critical of Farrakhan's teachings and said the  
minister has ``put a bad taste in people's mouths'' with 
inflammatory racial and anti-Semitic statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Muslims, 2X dropped his last name and replaced it with  
an X, which symbolizes the unknown. ``In the future I will accept a 
name that's befitting to my character,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Cross, a police officer whose beat covers the Quindaro  
Boulevard area, said he's impressed with 2X's group. Crime hasn't 
gone away, of course, but he attributed ``most of the cleanup along 
Quindaro to the United Nation of Islam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ordering lunch at Your Diner, Carolyn Fulson agreed. ``You  
notice a difference. There were drug dealers and a lot of hanging 
out. All that's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	2X said: ``We don't try to push our ideas on anybody, but we  
lead by example. Once people see us doing right, they want to do 
right, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, he said, when customers ask why cigarettes are not  
sold at the gas station, he tells them, ``It can be proven that 
cigarettes cause cancer, so it wouldn't be right for us to offer it 
to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healthfulness is the diner's theme, too, he said. Specialties  
include fish chili, the sweetener on the tables is fructose instead 
of sugar, and the salt comes from the sea and is free of iodine and 
additives. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses were started without any public funding. Members  
across the country pool their donations to run them, 2X said. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits are used to open new businesses. The United Nation of  
Islam also has a dry-cleaning service, a variety store, a warehouse 
and a trucking company in the Kansas City neighborhood. In the 
plans are an employment agency and coin laundry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not doing this to make money, but to spread an idea and  
to bring life back to our dead communities,'' 2X said. ``We want to 
leave something behind for our children to inherit.''

<HEADLINE> A City Divided: White Sox vs. Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs pitcher Terry Mulholland usually can  
tell right away if someone is a Cubs fan or a White Sox fan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cubs fan will say hello, maybe shake his hand and talk a  
while. A White Sox fan will give him the once-over and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
	It's nothing personal. But in Chicago, a person is either a  
White Sox or Cubs fan. There's no switching allegiances and no 
rooting for both teams. And there's definitely no fraternizing with 
the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go into that series, you know it's more than just  
playing another team as far as fans are concerned,'' Mulholland 
said. ``You know people in the stands are hyped up. They have 
greater expectations than most other games so it adds to the 
electricity of the ball park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Williams, a Hall of Famer with the Cubs who's now the  
team's dugout coach, says the rivalry is ``just like 
Alabama-Auburn. You can lose to anybody, but don't lose to the Sox. 
I guess they say the same things over there with the White Sox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, split  
their allegiances because they want to have something to fight 
about,'' Williams said. ``It's a rivalry for bragging rights for 
the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which makes this one of the best weekends of the year for  
Chicago baseball fans. Or one of the worst, depending on one's 
loyalty. The first of two Crosstown Series begins Friday at Wrigley 
Field, so Cubs and White Sox fans will be arguing loudly for three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's got the better team, the Kiddie Corps or the Geezers?  
Who's a better power hitter, Frank Thomas or Sammy Sosa? Whose 
bullpen is more dangerous -- and that's not a compliment these days 
-- and which pitcher has the best stuff? Which field is better, 
Wrigley or Comiskey Park? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a city divided for almost a century,'' Cubs first  
baseman Mark Grace said. ``Fans get into it and there will be great 
arguments all around the pubs for that week. It's good stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even for the players, though their passions don't run nearly as  
deep as their fans. They say there's no animosity between the 
teams. Sosa even wore a White Sox uniform for a few seasons, while 
White Sox pitcher Jaime Navarro had some of his best years on the 
North Side. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to this series, there's something special,  
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be three days of almost 50,000 or whatever you  
can get in the ballpark,'' he said. ``It's not a bitter rivalry. 
It's more, `We think we've got a better team than you,' and that's 
just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has played for the White Sox his entire career and knows  
exactly what he's in for this weekend. But the rest of the South 
Siders might not. The White Sox have the second-youngest team in 
the majors, and manager Jerry Manuel said it's tough for them to 
fully appreciate the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, they know bragging rights for the Windy City are at stake  
and they've been told repeatedly how much it means to the fans. But 
just wait until they get to Wrigley on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The South Side and North Side fans don't like each other and  
they get into that series,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs and White Sox have played each other often through the  
years, with the White Sox having a 120-82-6 advantage. But most of 
the games were in spring training or exhibitions, so they don't 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to interleague play, however, they do now. The White Sox  
won the 1997 series at Comiskey and the Cubs responded last year 
with a 3-0 sweep at Wrigley. And this year? 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the way I look at it, they should beat us because  
of the inexperience of this team and they have a veteran team,'' 
Thomas said. ``But you never know what might happen. There's a lot 
of teams supposed to beat us and we're holding our own.''

<HEADLINE>  N. Korea Soccer Team Holds Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCAFEE, N.J. (AP) -- Hard by the driving range at the Ballyowen  
golf course, not far from the clubhouse and the first fairway, sits 
a soccer field. One of the club's directors still plays the game 
and convinced his associates to build it. 
</P>
<P>
	They built it, and the North Korean women's soccer team came. On  
Thursday, the Women's World Cup's most secretive squad practiced in 
the midst of rolling green hills and beautiful links. It was a site 
they are never likely to see at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a golf course in my country,'' one team  
official said. ``But I am not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is for sure is that the Koreans aren't comfortable in the  
media spotlight. Their 20-player roster list includes names and 
uniform numbers. Nothing else. No positions, heights, weights, 
ages, hometowns or international appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of those players, captain Kim Kum Sil, was made  
available to speak at the lone media session team officials will 
allow. Most of the questions were answered by technical advisers 
and the secretary-general of the North Korean soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not distract the players,'' secretary-general Ryu Song  
Il said when asked if the players would be mingling with 
Korean-Americans during the tournament. ``Doing any kind of 
activities that might affect players while they are conditioning 
and training is not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the players appeared to be having a good time during  
the practice session -- as they jogged a lap, they headed straight 
through the sprinklers that were watering the grass, giggling and 
trying to see who could force the other to get most wet -- Kim said 
they are not yet comfortable with their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been here six days, and our prime task is to qualify  
for the Olympics in Sydney,'' she said. North Korea must make the 
quarterfinals to have a shot at the 2000 Games. ``A lot of things 
have changed, such as the time change. We are having jet lag and we 
still are not accustomed to the climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to get accustomed to them and the things we can  
concentrate on as soon possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Korean player, Kim Sun Hui, previously has been to the  
United States. She played in an All-Star game before the draw 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players, who all wear their hair short and run with  
similar gaits, speak English. Of the 34 people traveling with the 
Korean delegation, only a handful can converse in English. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two chose to do so on Thursday, and one was a translator.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryu, who speaks English, was asked about training facilities  
back home. He was standing perhaps 200 yards from the majestic 
clubhouse when he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true we are suffering at home. It is temporary due to  
natural disasters and unforeseen circumstances. We believe our 
people will overcome those difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not encountered any difficulties in training for the  
World Cup, thanks to the meticulous care of our federation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of that federation, Kim Hak-Yong, the team's technical  
official, praised the rapid development of the players, who have 
played Asian power China tight the last two years and beaten Japan, 
the other tournament representative from Asia. North Korea finished 
third in an international event in Bulgaria earlier this year that 
was won by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The countries we have played have been in the World Cup, and  
this is our first time,'' Kim Hak-Yong said. ``They have more 
experience than us in women's football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think women's football is one of the sports close to Korean  
women in a physical sense. In elementary schools and higher schools 
we have a football class, and each school district has 
extracurricular activity for football. We have a program to bring 
up the women at all levels and in every age group. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of girls who look forward to becoming a football player  
believe this World Cup is an inspiration to the development of our 
team,'' he concluded. ``There is a bright future for the 
development of women's football in our country.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks on the Brink of NBA Finals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One more win, and the New York Knicks have a  
shot at their first title since the days of Willis, Clyde and Earl 
the Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
	One more loss, and the Indiana Pacers go home with their fourth  
Eastern Conference finals loss in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-game season for us,'' Reggie Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 of the best-of-7 series is Friday night, with Madison  
Square Garden the site of the most important Knicks game in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Game 7 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, also  
against Indiana, has New York had a chance to make it to the 
championship round and go for the franchise's first title since 
1973, when Willis Reed, Clyde Frazier and Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe 
led the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to do it for our fans at home,'' Latrell Sprewell  
said. ``I'd like to finish Indiana off there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an improbable scenario these Knicks find themselves in the  
second week of June. After a season of underachieving, bickering, 
backstabbing and barely qualifying for the playoffs, they stand 
poised to become the lowest-seeded team ever to make the finals. 
Just look at all the obstacles they are overcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Their franchise center, Patrick Ewing, is walking around in a  
cast, reduced to cheering on a cast of teammates who were all 
playing elsewhere five years ago the last time the Pacers and 
Knicks went at each other with so much at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Their beleaguered coach, Jeff Van Gundy, still doesn't know how  
badly the team's management wants him back -- or if they want him 
back at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Their leading scorer, Sprewell, is having to acclimate himself  
to a sudden shift into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Their starting center, Chris Dudley, doesn't score.  
</P>
<P>
	Their point guards, Chris Childs and Charlie Ward, are providing  
virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Their fans booed them as recently as Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one thought we would be where we are now,'' said Marcus  
Camby, who has emerged as a force in this series. ``Just the 
opportunity to go to the finals is a dream come true for most of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Pacers have going for them heading into Game 6, aside  
from their advantages in depth and experience, is the Knicks' 
recent history of failing to seize the moment and make things easy 
on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round, they had an opportunity to finish off the  
Miami Heat in Game 4 at the Garden but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	In this round, they had an opportunity in Game 4 to take a  
commanding 3-1 lead at home but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mistake, and I think we made it after Game 3 in the first  
round, was saying we don't want to go back to Miami,'' Van Gundy 
said Thursday. ``We need to focus on what we want rather than what 
we don't want, and that's to go to San Antonio and have a chance 
for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing right now for us is how do we break the  
cycle of win, lose, win, lose. It's very difficult to win two in a 
row in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will need to repeat all the things they forgot about  
in Game 4 and did well in Game 5 -- pushing the ball upcourt, 
attacking the basket, hitting the open man, playing aggressively 
rather than tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can play our game -- defense, rebounding and unselfish,  
low-turnover offense, we'll have a chance to win,'' Van Gundy said. 
``I want them in the right frame of mind. I don't want them to be 
preoccupied with the result and tighten up. I want them to go for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can win this series if you try to avoid  
losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Pacers, everything that was present in Game 4 but  
missing in Game 5 -- bench contributions from Jalen Rose and Antonio 
Davis, energy and offensive aggression from Mark Jackson and Chris 
Mullin, speed getting back on defense -- needs to reappear in Game 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers coach Larry Bird was especially harsh on his team after  
its loss Wednesday night, dumbstruck that it had given away a 
14-point lead and received poor efforts from so many key 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the situation we wanted to be in, but that's the way  
it is,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 conference finals tied at 2-2 in this decade, 10 have  
gone to the team that won Game 5. The exception was in 1994, when 
Miller scored 25 fourth-quarter points to beat the Knicks in the 
Garden, only to have the Knicks come back to win Game 6 in Indiana 
and Game 7 at home. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's Eastern Conference finals against the Bulls, the  
Pacers were facing a 3-2 deficit entering a Game 6 that they won at 
Market Square Arena before losing Game 7 at Chicago. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> US, Russia Discuss Kosovo Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian and U.S. officials grappled Thursday with  
the sticky question of Moscow's precise role in the peacekeeping 
operation for Kosovo during talks meant to spell out future 
cooperation with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott headed a delegation  
trying to forge a compromise on how Russian troops will work with 
forces authorized by the United Nations to secure peace in the 
troubled Yugoslav province. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says its forces will make up the core, but Russia says it  
will not put its troops under the alliance's command. 
</P>
<P>
	No breakthroughs were announced, though both sides expressed  
optimism that a compromise could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are tough issues,'' Talbott told reporters. ``It's a  
work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, praised NATO's decision to  
suspend its bombing campaign in Yugoslavia on Thursday after his 
government gave preliminary approval to send Russian peacekeeping 
troops into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``A (bombing) pause is good, but it's not enough,'' Yeltsin said  
in statement. ``I evaluate this as the first step in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian leader -- who has spoken out strongly against the  
airstrikes since they began in March -- also called for a major 
reconstruction effort in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton spoke to Yeltsin by phone and thanked him for  
Russia's mediation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Yeltsin's support for the peace plan, many Russian  
political and military leaders have expressed strong opposition, 
charging that Russia yielded to NATO's demands and failed to defend 
Yugoslavia, an ally. Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin defended the 
government's compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia made large concessions on Kosovo, but they are  
justified because an end must be put to the war,'' Stepashin told 
visiting 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev gave a ``preliminary  
order'' authorizing the deployment of troops, and an airborne 
brigade of 2,500 was making preparations, the Interfax news agency 
reported. It was not clear when they might reach Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo peace plan calls for up to 50,000 peacekeeping troops  
and NATO insists it will lead the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very strongly, and I think that our Russian colleagues  
agree, that unity of command is very important, and unity of 
command means that all of Kosovo will be under one command 
arrangement,'' Talbott said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that anything that would undercut or diminish the  
international military presence was not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott also said that Kosovo ``has been the single most serious  
test of (U.S.-Russian) relationships since the end of the Cold 
War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians already take part in a Western-led peacekeeping  
operation in Bosnia, and the United States and its allies envision 
that as the model for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are arrangements, for which there's precedent in Bosnia,  
that would still allow Russian forces to participate,'' Talbott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have suggested that Kosovo could be divided  
into sectors for troops from various countries. But U.S. and NATO 
officials have said they don't envision a special ``Russian 
sector'' in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE>  N. Korea Soccer Team Holds Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCAFEE, N.J. (AP) -- Hard by the driving range at the Ballyowen  
golf course, not far from the clubhouse and the first fairway, sits 
a soccer field. One of the club's directors still plays the game 
and convinced his associates to build it. 
</P>
<P>
	They built it, and the North Korean women's soccer team came. On  
Thursday, the Women's World Cup's most secretive squad practiced in 
the midst of rolling green hills and beautiful links. It was a site 
they are never likely to see at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a golf course in my country,'' one team  
official said. ``But I am not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is for sure is that the Koreans aren't comfortable in the  
media spotlight. Their 20-player roster list includes names and 
uniform numbers. Nothing else. No positions, heights, weights, 
ages, hometowns or international appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of those players, captain Kim Kum Sil, was made  
available to speak at the lone media session team officials will 
allow. Most of the questions were answered by technical advisers 
and the secretary-general of the North Korean soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not distract the players,'' secretary-general Ryu Song  
Il said when asked if the players would be mingling with 
Korean-Americans during the tournament. ``Doing any kind of 
activities that might affect players while they are conditioning 
and training is not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the players appeared to be having a good time during  
the practice session -- as they jogged a lap, they headed straight 
through the sprinklers that were watering the grass, giggling and 
trying to see who could force the other to get most wet -- Kim said 
they are not yet comfortable with their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been here six days, and our prime task is to qualify  
for the Olympics in Sydney,'' she said. North Korea must make the 
quarterfinals to have a shot at the 2000 Games. ``A lot of things 
have changed, such as the time change. We are having jet lag and we 
still are not accustomed to the climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to get accustomed to them and the things we can  
concentrate on as soon possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Korean player, Kim Sun Hui, previously has been to the  
United States. She played in an All-Star game before the draw 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players, who all wear their hair short and run with  
similar gaits, speak English. Of the 34 people traveling with the 
Korean delegation, only a handful can converse in English. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two chose to do so on Thursday, and one was a translator.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryu, who speaks English, was asked about training facilities  
back home. He was standing perhaps 200 yards from the majestic 
clubhouse when he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true we are suffering at home. It is temporary due to  
natural disasters and unforeseen circumstances. We believe our 
people will overcome those difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not encountered any difficulties in training for the  
World Cup, thanks to the meticulous care of our federation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of that federation, Kim Hak-Yong, the team's technical  
official, praised the rapid development of the players, who have 
played Asian power China tight the last two years and beaten Japan, 
the other tournament representative from Asia. North Korea finished 
third in an international event in Bulgaria earlier this year that 
was won by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The countries we have played have been in the World Cup, and  
this is our first time,'' Kim Hak-Yong said. ``They have more 
experience than us in women's football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think women's football is one of the sports close to Korean  
women in a physical sense. In elementary schools and higher schools 
we have a football class, and each school district has 
extracurricular activity for football. We have a program to bring 
up the women at all levels and in every age group. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of girls who look forward to becoming a football player  
believe this World Cup is an inspiration to the development of our 
team,'' he concluded. ``There is a bright future for the 
development of women's football in our country.''

<HEADLINE> New Football League To Be Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest attempt at a pro football alternative  
to the NFL will be unveiled Friday, a new 12-team spring league 
that its sponsors say will begin in February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 12 owners are singers Wayne Newton and Dionne Warwick  
and among the founders is Dennis Murphy, who was involved the World 
Hockey Association, the American Basketball Association and other 
sports ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been two challenges to the NFL in the last three  
decades -- the World Football League, which played in the late 
summer and fall and lasted two years in the 1970s and the United 
States Football League, which played in the spring from 1983-85. 
</P>
<P>
	The USFL, which produced numerous NFL players and coaches went  
out of business after being awarded just $3 in an antitrust suit 
against the established league. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been talk of other leagues, including one sponsored by  
NBC and Turner Sports after they lost television contracts with the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	This one is called the International Football Federation.  
</P>
<P>
	A similarly named league was introduced at a lavish news  
conference in the 1980s, but never got beyond the announcement 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We blew the budget on the press conference,'' a participant  
explained later. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ITF hopes to put five of its franchises in NFL cities --  
New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit and Denver. Three more will be 
in locations deserted by NFL teams -- Los Angeles, Houston and 
Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four franchises are listed for Hartford, Conn., San  
Jose Calif., Toronto and Orlando, Fla.

<HEADLINE> German Slave Labor Fund Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Victims groups reacted with anger Thursday to  
details of a compensation fund announced by 16 German companies 
that profited from Nazi-era slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, Bayer and other major industrial concerns had  
previously agreed to establish the fund with a declared goal of 
quashing class-action suits filed in the United States on behalf of 
hundreds of thousands of people forced to work for the Nazi war 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lump-sum payments would be based partly on need and would be  
given only to victims who were slave laborers for six months or 
longer, the companies announced Thursday. Average pensions and cost 
of living in a claimant's home country would determine the 
compensation, meaning that victims in poorer eastern European 
countries would get less than those in the United States, Canada 
and other western nations. 
</P>
<P>
	When the payments would start and the fund's total value will be  
decided in the coming weeks in meetings with U.S. and German 
government representatives, providing there are guarantees that 
lawsuits will be dropped, said Manfred Gentz, a representative of 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	However, lawyers for the victims said they were determined to  
press on with the suits. 
</P>
<P>
	German attorney Michael Witti, who works with U.S.-based lawyer  
Ed Fagan, said he was particularly dismayed by the six-month 
clause. Victims from Hungary are immediately excluded, he said, 
because Nazi transports from that country did not begin until late 
in the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``They misunderstand how serious this is,'' Witti said. ``There  
is no single intention of dropping the lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and others representing former slave laborers complained that  
the details announced Thursday were not agreed to in ongoing 
negotiations among industry, government and victims groups about 
how to settle compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims against  
Germany rejected the proposed fund in a statement, saying: ``We 
object to the notion that slave laborers would be placed on an 
inverted hierarchy. Survival was a miracle and this ... would 
penalize those who managed to escape the Nazis' murderous 
methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the fund, industry representatives said Chancellor  
Gerhard Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, helped draft the 
proposal and approved it two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hombach has been holding negotiations for months with Jewish  
representatives and government officials from the United States, 
Israel and former Eastern Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the growing lawsuits, industrial groups agreed in  
principle last fall to compensate victims after years of insisting 
the German government should settle Nazi-era claims. The government 
had argued that the individual companies were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	People whose property was destroyed during the Holocaust to the  
benefit of German industry also can receive compensation, although 
the fund does not cover slave laborers who were prisoners of war or 
who worked in agriculture or for municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also participating in the fund are: Allianz, BASF, BMW, Deutsche  
Bank, Degussa-Huels, Dresdner Bank, Thyssen-Krupp, Hoechst, 
Siemens, Volkswagen, RAG, Deutz, VEBA and Commerzbank. The newly 
merged DaimlerChrysler will settle on behalf of Daimler-Benz.

	Report: UN Troop Deployment Delayed  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Plans for moving NATO troops into  
Kosovo from Macedonia on Friday appear to have been delayed. 
Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the operation 
had been pushed back, possibly as many as 24 hours. Troops were 
still at the border at dawn and showed no sign of preparing to move 
out. Without citing a source, a British newspaper, The Daily 
Telegraph, reported the operation was postponed because some 
contributing nations, including the United States, said they were 
not ready. The U.N. Security Council on Thursday approved a 
resolution authorizing a peacekeeping force of as many as 50,000 
troops, including 7,000 Americans.

	U.S., Cuba Clash Over Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Cuba on Thursday  
hurled insults and accusations at each other during a Security 
Council discussion of Kosovo. Cuba launched the back-and-forth with 
a speech in support of Yugoslavia that condemned NATO's airstrikes 
as a genocide that served to consolidate U.S. control over the 
world. Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh fired back, saying, 
``Apparently, the well-documented phenomenon of massive ethnic 
cleansing, the terrorization and brutalization of the civilian 
population is not allowed to register on the official Cuban mind.''

	Vatican Satisfied With Kosovo Plan

	SIEDLCE, Poland (AP) -- The Vatican says its safitsfied with the

the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and the Serb 
repression of the Kosovo Albanians. Asked whether Pope John Paul II 
-- who is on a 13-day pilgrimage to Poland -- favored the use of 
international troops in the region, a Vatican spokesman said, 
``naturally, steps must be taken to protect the refugees.''

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A tense military confrontation between  
North and South Korea moved into its fourth day Friday, when four 
northern naval ships sailed back into disputed waters in the Yellow 
Sea. The North Korean patrol boats again took up positions inside 
the rich crab fishing area before dawn Friday, escorting about a 
dozen fishing boats, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. North 
Korean warships have been sailing in and out of the disputed waters 
since Tuesday. Their main mission appears to be guarding northern 
fishing vessels operating in the area, ministry officials said.

	New E-Mail Computer Virus Spreading

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new computer virus was spreading across the  
Internet Thursday, infecting machines by e-mail and ruining 
computer files. Anti-virus teams in the government and at 
universities were trying to determine the severity of the outbreak 
of ``Worm.Explore.Zip.'' General Electric temporarily shut down its 
e-mail system when the virus was detected, but damage was minimal 
because computer personnel were on the lookout for the bug. 
Microsoft cut off its corporate e-mail connection with the Internet 
for two hours as a precaution.

	Lawmakers Can Recycling for House

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has killed a provision that would  
have required its offices to begin recycling their trash. Following 
objections from Republicans on Thursday, the language was struck 
from a $1.9 billion bill financing Congress' own operations next 
year. The House has had a voluntary recycling program for a decade. 
But The Associated Press reported last month that most 
congressional offices were still mixing garbage, aluminum cans, 
bottles and different grades of paper. Many federal agencies and 
local governments separate their trash and sell recyclable 
material.

beating Buffalo 4-2 Thursday night to even the Stanley Cup series 
at a game apiece. Hull, one of the NHL's top scorers for years but 
absent from the Stanley Cup finals since his rookie year in 1986, 
beat Dominik Hasek with a wicked slap shot from above the right 
circle dot. The goal capped a Dallas comeback that saw the heavily 
favored Stars contained by the Sabres' smothering defense for two 
periods, only to bury Buffalo with 19 shots in the final period.

<HEADLINE> Workplaces Improve Safety Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Disasters that killed hundreds of workers in the  
early part of the century led to changes that have lowered the 
death rate from job-related accidents by 90 percent since 1913, the 
government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Work-related deaths have declined from 61 per 100,000 workers in  
1913 to 4 per 100,000 in 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been lots of efforts by labor and management and  
there's been a lot of research, education and regulatory activities 
undertaken,'' Nancy Stout of the CDC's National institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 23,000 people died from work-related injuries in  
1913 compared with 5,100 in 1997, according to data from the 
National Safety Council and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
During this same period, the work force grew from 38 million to 
about 130 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of disasters in the early 1900s led to workplace safety  
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1907 coal mine explosion at Monongah, W.Va., that killed at  
least 360 people led to passage in 1910 of the Organic Act, which 
established the U.S. Bureau of Mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the nation's most stringent workplace-safety laws were  
prompted by the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire in New York City. 
The blaze at a garment factory claimed 146 lives, mostly young 
women. There were no alarms or sprinklers, and the exits were 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline has been particularly pronounced in high-risk  
industries such as mining, where the average death rate was 329 per 
100,000 from 1911 to 1915, compared with 25 per 100,000 in 1996-97, 
the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Workers now realize they don't have to accept the risk of  
injury as part of a job,'' Ms. Stout said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among steelworkers, there were 17 deaths nationwide in 1997  
compared with 195 in 1906 and 1907 in one Pennsylvania county 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, industries with the highest average rates for fatal  
workplace accidents include mining, agriculture/forestry/fishing 
and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading causes of workplace deaths involve motor vehicles,  
homicides and machine-related injuries.

<HEADLINE> Norsk Hydro, Statoil Raise Saga Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's state-controlled oil companies,  
Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro ASA, offered more money Thursday for 
Norway's No. 3 oil company, Saga Petroleum ASA, in an effort to 
outbid France's Elf Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegian companies offered 135 kroner ($17.22) per share in  
stocks and cash for Saga shares, 10 kroner ($1.27) more than Elf's 
cash bid earlier this week. That values the privately held Saga at 
about 20 billion kroner ($2.55 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Saga's shares immediately rose on the Oslo Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	``The objective of the transaction is to create value for  
Hydro's and Statoil's shareholders by optimizing development and 
operations of oil and gas reserves,'' Norsk Hydro said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norsk Hydro-Statoil bid is contingent on 70 percent of  
Saga's shareholders accepting the offer by June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga Petroleum's board scheduled a meeting Friday to consider  
the competing offers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Elf.  
</P>
<P>
	Saga controls vast oil and natural gas reserves, mainly off  
Norway. It announced austerity measures this year after posting 
losses for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Following its original bid, Norsk Hydro agreed with Statoil AS,  
which already owns 19.4 percent of Saga, to split Saga's assets so 
Statoil would get 25 percent. Norsk Hydro would take the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga employees had supported Elf's bid because the French  
company promised Saga would continue operating under it own name, 
while the Norwegian offer would break it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, which employs about 40,000 people worldwide, now  
promises to add Saga's employees to its own staff, although Saga 
would still be broken up.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel producers seeking tariffs to block  
low-priced shipments from Japan face their final -- and toughest -- 
hurdle Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission will decide whether the  
domestic industry is hurt by Japanese pricing practices already 
deemed illegal by the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel, the industry's leading  
product, would effectively make Japanese shipments too expensive to 
sell in the United States. The U.S. industry believes such 
sanctions are necessary to counter last year's surge in imports, 
which it blames for thousands of layoffs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's vote could affect future shipments from Japan  
as well as from other countries looking for signs of what practices 
are permissible. A negative vote also could boost support in 
Congress for global quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't give us the (tariffs), I think people would be  
outraged,'' said William Klinefelter, Washington representative of 
the United Steelworkers of America union. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry credits the threat of tariffs for the roughly  
40 percent drop in overall steel shipments from Japan and other 
countries since November. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot-rolled shipments from Japan dropped to 7,428 metric tons in  
April, compared with 405,974 in November. By comparison, shipments 
of the same product from Korea, which was not a target of the trade 
cases, remained at roughly 60,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruled in April that Japan violated U.S.  
trade laws by dumping hot-rolled steel in U.S. markets at prices 
below production costs or home-market prices. The department 
proposed tariffs of as much as 67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But before any tariffs are imposed, the trade commission must  
determine that the dumping has injured or threatens to hurt U.S. 
industry. While Commerce finds dumping in nearly all cases it 
reviews, the commission finds injury only about half the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ITC is the only place you can go to get even the potential  
of an objective review of the facts,'' said Russell Smith, a lawyer 
for Japanese steel producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member trade commission's vote Friday comes nearly a  
year after domestic producers filed their complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The factors the trade commission uses to evaluate injury are not  
as clear-cut as those used by Commerce, and include individual 
commissioners' assessments of the economic health of U.S. 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports rose following the Asian economic crisis, which drove  
down demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers to turn 
to the healthy U.S. economy for sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accuses Japanese, Russian and Brazilian  
producers of dumping hot-rolled steel in the United States at 
unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has tentatively struck deals with  
Russia and Brazil in which those countries could avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily reducing steel shipments. That leaves Japan as the 
remaining target.

<HEADLINE> Bush Plans Iowa Straw Poll Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- There are early signs that Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush is working to organize supporters to turn out for 
this summer's Republican straw poll, viewed as an early test of 
strength in a crowded GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign's approach to the straw poll is one of the first  
tactical decisions Bush must make, and the early signs indicate a 
cautious stance designed to minimize risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides insist that no final decision has been made, but say  
they'd be foolish not to ``do some basics'' to keep their options 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone-bank operation is up and running to identify potential  
backers, as is a direct mail operation and there are reports of 
buses being reserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they've done a huge paid telemarketing effort in the  
past week or two,'' said David Kochel, an aide to former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander. ``We've gotten all kinds of feedback from our 
supporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides described the effort as simply laying the groundwork  
should a decision be made to compete intensely in the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to do the advance work and you're going to do the  
preparation just so you have that option,'' said Bush spokesman 
Eric Woolson. ``If you don't do some basics that limits your 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush faces a dilemma in approaching the high-profile August  
event. He is far ahead in most of the early polls, but doesn't make 
his first campaign swing in the state until this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Other campaigns have been organizing in the state for months and  
even years, and are considerably ahead on that front. If Bush 
chooses to compete in the event, it isn't likely he could match the 
soaring expectations his high poll standings would bring. 
</P>
<P>
	But ignoring the event brings risks as well. By ducking the  
straw poll entirely, Bush risks an embarrassingly poor showing as 
other candidates organize busloads of backers. 
</P>
<P>
	A middle-ground is where Bush has apparently settled, one that's  
been urged by several strategists in the state. That calls for 
quietly organizing backers without a high-profile campaign that 
would raise expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be serious about it and they're going to be  
putting an effort into it,'' said Bob Haus, an aide to publisher 
Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they talked to some people about buses,'' said Monte  
Shaw, an aide to former cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone bank operation is the first step in a classic  
organizational tactic of blanketing a state with phone calls to 
identify backers, following up with direct mail and then sending in 
field organizers to turn out identified backers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way to do things with money you couldn't otherwise do  
with volunteers,'' said Kochel. ``You pay for a bunch of phone 
calls out of a professional center, then you turn that response 
over to a turnout program. Yeah, they're working the straw poll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a basic technique,'' said Haus.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's been the subject of discussion,'' said Woolson, who  
said no final decision has been made.

<HEADLINE> Medical Device Cos. Surveyed on Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about risks to patients, the  
government is preparing a list of medical device makers with 
products that could have Y2K problems. In extreme cases, dangerous 
devices will be seized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration also may issue public warnings  
or suggest voluntary recalls if the agency finds medical devices 
that could malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, the Health and Human 
Services deputy secretary, Kevin Thurm, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke at a hearing of the Senate's special panel on the year  
2000 computer problem. The Senate, meantime, tried to finish work 
on a bill, eagerly sought by business and high-tech groups, that 
would limit the ability to sue over Y2K-related breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would give companies a 90-day period to fix  
computer problems before lawsuits can be filed, encourage 
mediation, make it harder to file class action lawsuits and cap 
punitive damages that small businesses must pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A vote on passage was expected Tuesday on the measure, written  
by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with the help of several Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration supports the idea of stopping frivolous  
lawsuits but has threatened a veto, saying the bill would hurt 
consumers and small businesses with legitimate legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA action on medical devices came amid concerns that the  
health industry may be one of the most vulnerable to problems from 
computers that read only the last two digits in dates and mistake 
2000 for 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who with Sen. Robert Bennett,  
R-Utah, heads the special Y2K committee, said many hospitals and 
medical offices have failed to respond to industry surveys on Y2K 
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tolerating the 'unknown' elements in health care is a  
dangerous policy,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Responses so far to the surveys do not indicate any widespread  
problems that would put patients at risk, Thurm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurm said the FDA assessment would be finished by Oct. 1, a  
date that an official of the General Accounting Office, the 
investigate arm of Congress, said should be moved up to ensure time 
to deal with troubled equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO's Joel Willemssen said the FDA has developed a draft  
list of about 70 ``computer-controlled potentially high risk 
devices'' that include a powered emergency ventilator, infusion 
pump, glucose test system and fetal cardiac monitor and radiation 
therapy simulation system. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 

</P>
<P>
	The litigation bill is S. 96.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Says Tyson Can Train There </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson has been  
granted permission to train in Arizona for a boxing match in 
Nevada, possibly in August, Arizona and Maryland officials 
confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's looking forward to getting back into training  
and boxing,'' said Paul Kemp, an attorney for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said he does not know when Tyson plans to leave for  
Arizona. He must arrive at least by Monday, when he is to report to 
the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department in Phoenix, said 
John MacDonald, communications officer for the Arizona Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, paroled last month until February, pleaded no contest to  
misdemeanor assault charges that stemmed from a fender bender in 
Gaithersburg last August. He will continue with anger management 
counseling, as well as meeting his community service requirements, 
while in Arizona, Maryland corrections officials said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The boxer last fought in January and was behind on all three  
cards before he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round at 
Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Gov. Gets Uninvited Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Gov. Kirk Fordice isn't running for  
re-election, but you wouldn't know it with all the publicity the 
two-term Republican is getting these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few weeks after ducking out of the spotlight amid  
questions about his marriage, Fordice threatened a reporter who 
asked him about a European vacation he took with a woman while his 
wife, Pat, remained in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, a critic of President Clinton's affair with intern  
Monica Lewinsky, scolded Bert Case after the WLBT reporter asked 
about the vacation with a Memphis, Tenn., widow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me tell you something, you invade my privacy this way, six  
months from now, I'll whip your a--,'' a red-faced Fordice told 
Case, according to a videotaped recording of Tuesday's 
confrontation. ``You have no damn business playing these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest furor follows recent attention given to Fordice's new  
home -- one Mrs. Fordice said she was never invited to -- and the 
1996 car crash hours after the governor was seen having lunch with 
a woman while his wife was out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, 65, leaves office in about six months because of term  
limits. He has said he has no interest in higher office. 
</P>
<P>
	Caller after caller to Wednesday's ``Supertalk'' program on  
radio station WFMN said Fordice should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine percent were hard on him,'' said Paul Gallo, after  
callers used words like ``hypocrite,'' ``buffoon'' and ``national 
embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippians are generally very forgiving people. It's the  
inflammatory, in your face, don't-give-a-hoot attitude that people 
have found very offensive,'' Mississippi Baptist leader Paul Jones 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Friedeman, a minister and conservative columnist who urged  
Fordice to step down, said presidential candidate Dan Quayle might 
reconsider having the governor as a national campaign cochairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's communications director, Jonathan Baron, said the  
former vice president will talk to Fordice soon, and ``until they 
have a conversation it will be inappropriate for me to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor had completed his recent European trade mission and  
was joined on vacation by Ann G. Creson, WLBT reported, citing 
travel agency documents. The two spent several days touring France 
and were photographed together in the Memphis airport upon their 
return last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Press secretary Robbie Wilbur said Tuesday that Fordice made  
arrangements for the trip. Wilbur did not return phone calls 
Wednesday, and Mrs. Fordice's assistant said she had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice and his wife's marital troubles date to 1993, when he  
announced they were having ``irreconcilable differences.'' A day 
later, she issued a statement saying she would continue serving as 
first lady unless forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Mrs. Fordice said her husband of 44 years had  
bought a $230,000 home outside Jackson and never invited her to see 
it. She said she did not want a divorce, though she knew her 
husband's new home ``wasn't for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors have said Fordice spends his weekends there, but they  
refuse to talk about other occupants. Fordice and the first lady 
both live in the official governor's mansion during the week. He 
has simply said the home is part of his private life. 
</P>
<P>
	Creson wouldn't comment Wednesday. Her husband of 43 years, Roy  
Franklin Creson Jr., died in November from cancer at age 66. He was 
the retired owner of Creson-Watson Manufacturing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice and Creson were sweethearts in junior high school in  
Memphis and became reacquainted at a reunion in 1992, the year 
before the governor disclosed ``irreconcilable differences'' with 
his wife, WLBT said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the governor crashed a state-owned car after he  
was seen having lunch with a woman near Memphis while his wife was 
in France. A waiter recalled serving wine to the governor and his 
female companion. It was never firmly established whether the woman 
was Creson. 
</P>
<P>
	Passers-by pulled Fordice from his car after it careened off a  
highway and caught fire. He was hospitalized for three weeks with a 
bruised heart and lung, fractured vertebrae, several broken ribs 
and a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice has said he does not remember why he was in Memphis that  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some state Republicans wonder if Fordice's support is what they  
need for upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any candidates are going to closely associate  
with him,'' said Alvin Endt, a GOP state representative from Ocean 
Springs who has supported Fordice. ``They're not going to ride his 
coattails after this. If they do, they're crazy.''

aggressive players in the emerging gas-to-liquids business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gas-to-liquids technology is so promising that its development  
could create an entire paradigm shift throughout the petroleum 
industry,'' said Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	He said trillions of cubic feet of natural gas is available in  
vast but hard-to-reach reserves, too far from markets to be 
captured and transported at a profit. Converting it to a liquid 
means it can be profitably produced and more easily and cheaply 
moved to world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about natural gas is that it's very abundant, and  
the price reflects that,'' Collins &AMP; Co. analyst Brian L. 
Eisenbarth said Thursday in San Francisco. ``You have to keep costs 
down as low as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Exxon Corp.  
and BP Amoco PLC, are working on similar technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasol, the world's largest synthetic-fuel producer, is based in  
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chevron spokeswoman said the company anticipates spending  
billions of dollars to develop the technology. Competitors say if 
Chevron follows through, it could be the leader in the fledgling 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron is building a conversion plant in Nigeria, which is set  
to be completed in 2002. The $1 billion project, also with Sasol, 
will be the largest natural-gas-to-liquids project in the world.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee State Shakes Up Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee State University is firing one  
official and moving assistant football coach Johnny Cole out of the 
athletic department because of rule violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The school hopes the moves will keep the NCAA from taking  
harsher action against the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves follow a four-month investigation by the school into  
eight allegations of infractions of NCAA rules. The allegations 
dealt with scholarships, recruiting, practice limits, monitoring 
and coach conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that the recommendations are meaningful. They are  
substantial,'' Anita Jenious, chairwoman of Tennessee State's 
investigative committee, said Wednesday. ``Certainly we can't 
speculate as to what the committee on infractions will decide, but 
we do believe that these actions that we recommended ... are very 
strong and a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Bell, Tennessee State's NCAA compliance coordinator, will  
be fired as of June 21. And effective July 1, head coach L.C. Cole 
will be put under a pay freeze and recruiting restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is also limiting its season to 38 recruitment visits  
for the next two years and cutting out two football scholarships 
for the next three years. It will also increase staffing and 
improve monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Two athletic directors have already lost their jobs over the  
infractions, and an assistant coach has been reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State denied one allegation and took no position on  
two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The school will appear before the NCAA Division I Committee on  
Infractions at its September meeting in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State denied having too little control over the  
football program, and it took no position on allegations that L.C. 
Cole gave money and free game tickets to a University of Alabama 
student he was recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnnie Cole will be reassigned to the school's division of  
student affairs July 1 and is barred from taking part in student 
athletics. His future at the school will be determined in December. 
If he returns as coach, he would have to attend rule compliance 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been on two years probation since last fall and was  
barred from one conference game. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, L.C. Cole, also has been on probation since the  
fall, was suspended from one conference game and must attend rules 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State also promised to fill vacant positions, and if  
the Tennessee Board of Regents approves, the athletics department 
will report to the president's office.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elie Compares Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Although Mario Elie won two championships  
with the Houston Rockets, heading into the NBA Finals with the San 
Antonio Spurs is a new experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have a larger cast of contributors. They've lost only  
once so far in the playoffs, and they've got a unique chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mostly unity,'' Elie said Thursday. ``We're playing well.  
We're all on the same page. We're a confident team. We're feeling 
good about ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, after sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers 4-0 to  
win the Western Conference title, must await the winner of the 
Eastern final between New York and Indiana. The Knicks lead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Finals begin Wednesday at the Alamodome.  
</P>
<P>
	Elie joined the Spurs as a free agent this season, coming from  
Houston, where he played on the 1994 and 1995 title teams. The 
Rockets defeated New York in seven games to win the NBA 
championship in 1994 and beat Orlando 4-0 to win in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Battling the Knicks again in the finals would be fun, said Elie,  
a New York native who grew up five minutes from Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to go back and play against the home team,'' he said.  
``I won my first championship against the Knicks. So it'd be nice 
to go there and know I'm going to play more, have a bigger role 
this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie took over the starting job at off-guard after the season  
began, replacing Jaren Jackson, who now comes off the bench and has 
been an offensive force in several Spurs' playoff victories. 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage the Spurs have had is getting point production  
consistently from several players. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Houston, you'd know who's going to deliver every night --  
Clyde (Drexler) and Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) are always going to put 
up some numbers,'' Elie said, adding that several other Houston 
players stepped up and produced in certain games. 
</P>
<P>
	The same is true with the Spurs, but more so, Elie said.  
</P>
<P>
	``On this team, we just ride the hot hand,'' he said. ``If a  
guy's hot, we keep going to him. Everybody's contributing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich agrees that's been part of the Spurs'  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to rely on one person to get everything done  
every night,'' he said. ``That does help us since we've got a lot 
of people who are willing to step up and to share in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going 6-8 in February, San Antonio went 31-5 the rest of  
the regular season to finish with the league's best record and 
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are 11-1 in the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	On Elie's Houston championship teams, the Rockets lost a few  
games in the early rounds. The fact that San Antonio is winning so 
much makes for high expectations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' he said. ``We swept two good teams and everybody  
expects us to sweep again, but it's tough. It's ... a lot of 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Will Perdue and Steve Kerr, who bring championship  
experience from their time with the Chicago Bulls, Elie is trying 
to prepare his teammates for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He feels fortunate to have another chance at a title.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lucky,'' he said. ``I've been blessed getting on  
these good teams. I thought this was the best situation for me. It 
turned out to be terrific. I'm in the finals. I've got a chance to 
win three. It looks good.''

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific, Pilots Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Averting a showdown that could have led to a  
strike or the mass firing of Cathay Pacific Airways pilots, the 
airline and union reached a deal Thursday that cuts salaries in 
exchange for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots said they got a slightly better deal than what Cathay  
offered earlier, ending a dispute that had grounded hundreds of 
Cathay flights over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay had been demanding that pilots take pay cuts of 7 percent  
over the next two years but said they could have stock options to 
cash in when the company's fortunes turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has suffered serious losses because of the Asian  
economic crisis and Hong Kong's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The highly paid senior pilots will have to take those cuts but  
junior pilots can expect salary increases of 3 percent to 5 percent 
over the next three years, said Tony Tyler, Cathay's director of 
corporate development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cathay Pacific has achieved what we set out to do,'' Tyler  
said. ``In the end, all the ingredients were there to come to an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay stands to save $180 million over the next decade, he told  
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no winners or losers,'' insisted John Findlay,  
general secretary of the pilots union, the Hong Kong Aircrew 
Officers Association. ``This is a victory for common sense, for the 
people and the economy of Hong Kong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay had persuaded flight attendants to agree to concessions  
earlier in the year but ran into a tougher fight against the 
pilots, who began calling in sick en masse, saying they were too 
stressed to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute devastated Cathay's flight schedule for nearly two  
weeks, affecting more than 85,000 passengers in and out of Hong 
Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay canceled 75 of its 119 flights on Thursday, for example,  
but said it had hired other airlines to fly 46 of the services on a 
charter basis to keep as many passengers as possible in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay could not say when it will be able to operate a full  
schedule, though Tyler said the company would bounce back ``as 
quickly and as efficiently as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler said it was too soon to say how many millions of dollars  
Cathay lost in the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots approved the deal in a special meeting Thursday  
night. Findlay said the union had gotten a slightly better deal on 
the payout of the stock options, and he predicted the agreement 
could bring a quick end to the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope things will return to normal as soon as possible,''  
Findlay said outside Hong Kong's Labor Department, where government 
officials had brought the two sides together.

<HEADLINE> Public TV Airs Gay Awareness Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A teacher asks a fourth-grader what being  
gay means. The confused boy explains haltingly that it has 
something to do with black people marrying white people. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what words they thought of to describe gay people, the  
class suggests ``pervert,'' ``weird,'' ``funny,'' ``fancy,'' 
``sick'' and ``gross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a first-grader volunteers that she knows two gay men.  
They live in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids are absorbing information. Some of it's accurate and some  
of it's really off the wall,'' said filmmaker Debra Chasnoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Her documentary, ``It's Elementary,'' began airing on dozens of  
public television stations this month despite having been turned 
down by the national PBS organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative groups have long complained about the film, which  
has been shown at teacher-training seminars, parent-teacher 
association meetings, and churches and synogogues since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Family Association, a conservative Christian group  
based in Biloxi, Miss., has urged its members to protest the 
broadcast. It and other groups have suggested PBS stations air a 
rebuttal video, ``Suffer the Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't commend a destructive activity to someone just to  
make them feel better. That's what ``It's Elementary'' does,'' said 
David Miller of the AFA. At least one major PBS station, KCTS in 
Seattle, agreed to put the rebuttal on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Elementary,'' filmed in classrooms in San Francisco; New  
York; Cambridge, Mass.; and Madison, Wis., eavesdrops on 
teacher-student discussions about stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 89 of the country's 347 public television stations plan  
to run ``It's Elementary,'' Chasnoff said. At least 80 have turned 
it down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After national PBS executives rejected the documentary, KQED-TV  
in San Francisco helped Chasnoff get American Public Television to 
distribute it, with financial support from the Ford Foundation, the 
Streisand Foundation and James C. Hormel, whom President Clinton 
appointed last week as the nation's first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	WNET in New York broadcast it last Thursday, drawing about  
172,000 viewers, an average prime-time audience, said station 
executive Stella Giammasi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of nasty calls before we aired this program from  
what seemed like a pressure group,'' Giammasi said. Afterward, he 
said, the station received 19 responses from viewers, eight 
negative and 11 positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasnoff, a lesbian who has two sons ages 10 and 5, said she  
made the film to inspire parents and teachers to try to raise 
children's sensitivity to gay issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to see if we could make a film to open up the  
public dialogue ... and encourage adults to rethink their 
assumptions,'' she said from her San Francisco office. ``To say 
it's not OK to have negative stereotypes about gay people. Gay 
people exist and should be treated respectfully like everyone 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she is considering a lawsuit over the rebuttal video  
since ``Suffer the Children'' uses much of her documentary without 
permission.

<HEADLINE> NATO Announces Halt to Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO today suspended its airstrikes  
against Yugoslavia after verifying the withdrawal of Serb forces 
was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few moments ago I instructed Gen. Wesley Clark to suspend  
NATO's air operations,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	``The withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo is  
taking place in accordance'' with the peace implementation deal 
worked out between NATO and Yugoslavia on Wednesday, Solana added. 
NATO began the allied air campaign on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the first troops of the international peacekeeping force  
would deploy in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything goes okay ... tomorrow we may see the first KFOR  
(Kovoso peacekeeping) soldiers deployed in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signoff in the allied air campaign was required in  
accordance with the peace accord that the commander of NATO troops 
in Macedonia, Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, signed late Wednesday in 
Macedonia after long and tortuous talks with his Yugoslav 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's formal ending of the air campaign came just hours after  
the first Serb forces left Kosovo in a convoy to comply with the 
peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied troops, meanwhile, were flowing into the Balkans today in  
preparation for deployment in Kosovo, where some 860,000 ethnic 
Albanians have fled -- most to Albania and Macedonia -- since March. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said 1,200 extra troops had moved to Macedonia in the past  
24 hours, bringing to 18,500 the level of allied troops in Kosovo's 
southern neighbor. It said the buildup will continue rapidly over 
the next few days as some 50,000 troops form the Kosovo force 
assemble. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO was already scaling down its air attacks before today's  
announcement. The alliance said its planes flew only 60 strikes 
over the previous 24 hours, compared to several hundred at the 
height of the 78-day bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that the last  
air strikes occurred in the early evening Wednesday, when the city 
of Urosevac in southern Kosovo was hit, several hours before the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enemy aircraft fell silent after that,'' said Tanjug.

<HEADLINE> Court Resolves Patent-Law Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court resolved a major patent-law  
dispute in the government's favor today, narrowing a specialized 
court's authority to second-guess federal officials' decisions on 
which inventions deserve patent protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-3 ruling said such decisions by the Patent and Trademark  
Office must be given more deference by a federal appeals court that 
specializes in technical cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than being able to overturn the office's patent decisions  
if they are ``clearly erroneous,'' the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit must employ a more deferential standard 
included in a federal law, the Administrative Procedures Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that standard, the appeals court can overturn a Patent and  
Trademark Office decision only if it is deemed ``arbitrary, 
capricious'' or ``unsupported by substantial evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case decided today began with a 1990 patent application nine  
people filed for a method of improving security for computer 
transactions, such as credit card purchases or banking on the 
Internet. They assigned their interest in the invention to Compaq, 
based in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patent and Trademark Office denied the application, saying  
the method was merely an obvious variation of previous inventions. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled  
that the patent office was wrong and the patent must be issued. 
That court relied on its longstanding practice of reversing patent 
office decisions found to be ``clearly erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Circuit said its traditional, less-deferential  
standard encouraged the patent office to state more clearly its 
reasons for granting or withholding a patent. 
</P>
<P>
	In appealing to the Supreme Court, the government said the  
Federal Circuit used the wrong standard. A majority of the justices 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that (the Administrative Procedures Act) does  
apply, and the Federal Circuit must use the framework set forth in 
(it),'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.  
Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Lehman vs. Zurko, 98-377.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Cuts Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England on Thursday lowered its base  
lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent -- its 
lowest level in 22 years -- in hopes of further stimulating economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The cut, announced after the monthly meeting of the bank's  
monetary committee, resumes a process of incremental monthly 
reductions in the base rate for loans to banks. The Bank of England 
decided in May to hold the base lending rate steady at 5.25 
percent, after having reduced it in six of the previous seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee based the latest reduction on its assessment that  
Britain's inflation rate was likely to come in below the 
government's targeted level of 2.5 percent, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to push rates to their lowest level since 1977 took  
financial markets by surprise. Neil Parker, an economist at The 
Royal Bank of Scotland called the move a mistake made in response 
to the continued strength of the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that to set monetary policy on the basis of a volatile  
instrument such as the pound can only mean extra volatility in 
interest rate markets,'' Parker said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But labor unions, which complain that a strong pound hurts  
British exports and endangers industrial jobs, applauded the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bank has shown clear vision and foresight,'' said John  
Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. He said 
British interest rates were still higher than those in continental 
Europe but that Thursday's cut ``takes us a heartening step 
closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unions and manufacturers say higher interest rates in Britain  
are a major reason for the strong pound, which makes British-made 
goods more expensive than competing products denominated in the 
euro and other currencies.

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Two courts rejected appeals Thursday by a  
man who could be the first Canadian executed in the United States 
since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Supreme Court and a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S.

	They ruled in response to petitions from Joseph Stanley Faulder,

the beating and stabbing of a 75-year-old woman during a robbery at 
her home in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegations from Canada, which has no death penalty, have made a

<HEADLINE> Facts About hearing Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts about hearing loss:  
</P>
<P>
	--You hear when the outer ear funnels sound waves into the ear  
canal, where they strike the eardrum and cause it to vibrate. Tiny 
bones in the middle ear conduct the vibrations to microscopic hairs 
in the inner ear, where they're converted to nerve impulses that 
the brain deciphers as sound. 
</P>
<P>
	--A number of conditions can cause hearing to deteriorate. Often,  
aging and noise are culprits. Symptoms include trouble hearing 
conversations, particularly in crowded or noisy rooms; asking 
people to repeat themselves; missing the doorbell or telephone; 
having people complain that you keep the TV too loud. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hearing aids often help. A doctor or audiologist, a specialist  
in hearing, first must test to determine the type of hearing loss 
and then fit an appropriate aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizations such as the American Speech-Language-Hearing  
Association in Rockville, Md., or the National Council on the Aging 
or Better Hearing Institute, both in Washington, can help patients 
find hearing professionals or additional information.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Death of Pro Wrestler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City police have launched a  
criminal investigation into the death of professional wrestler Owen 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, 34, plummeted 70 feet to his death May 23 at Kemper Arena  
when the quick release on his harness opened early as he was being 
lowered into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``In looking at the rigging, I have a concern whether this was  
the safest way to do this stunt,'' Police Maj. Gregory Mills said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills said detectives will investigate whether specialists hired  
by the World Wrestling Federation were using the appropriate 
equipment, whether they used it correctly and if Hart was properly 
trained to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be seeking expert advice to help us draw some  
conclusions,'' Mills said. ``We can't say if it was right or wrong 
or if due caution was taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three workers were on the arena catwalk with Hart before the  
stunt. Two were stagehands from the Kansas City area and the other 
was a rigger from Florida. All were hired by the WWF. 
</P>
<P>
	The rigger told police he connected a ring on Hart's vest to a  
snap hook, and connected the snap hook to a ring on the end of the 
rope. Then Hart stepped off the catwalk, putting his full weight 
onto the rope. 
</P>
<P>
	The rigger told police he saw Hart adjusting his vest and ``Blue  
Blazer'' costume as he dangled in midair, waiting for the cue to 
descend. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the rigger said, he heard the distinctive ``snap'' that  
the quick release mechanism makes when it opens. That's when Hart 
plunged to the arena floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not pushed, and the equipment that was to lower him to  
the floor does not appear to have been tampered with,'' Mills said. 
``We know someone else did not pull the ring to trigger the quick 
release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's family did not want to comment on the investigation, said  
family attorney Gary C. Robb. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF officials did not return telephone calls Wednesday. The  
rigger who oversaw Hart's stunt could not be reached for comment.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- It may require a leap of faith to take a  
satirist seriously, but Martin Mull said his paintings are for true

<HEADLINE> IRS Allows Smokers Some Deductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smokers trying to kick the habit can claim  
some costs as medical expenses on income tax returns under a 
decision Thursday by the Internal Revenue Service that reverses a 
20-year-old agency position. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors involved in smoking cessation programs said the IRS  
ruling could have broader ramifications by persuading providers of 
health benefits packages to include such treatment in their 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Dr. Mike Eriksen, director of smoking  
and health at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
``There is no better preventative program than stopping someone 
from smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Surgeon General reports since 1988 that nicotine is  
addictive and smoking harms health, the IRS concluded that programs 
and prescription drugs that help someone quit smoking are no 
different from efforts to treat alcoholism or drug addiction -- both 
of which are tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the research of the last decade has documented is that  
this is one of the most powerful addictions that a person can 
succumb to,'' said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the Center for 
Tobacco Research and Prevention at the University of Wisconsin. 
``It's not just some bad habit. It's a dangerous, chronic 
disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In revoking its 1979 position against the deduction, the IRS  
agreed: ``A strong causal link exists between smoking and several 
diseases,'' the agency said in its announcement. ``Nicotine, a 
substance common to all forms of tobacco, is a powerfully addictive 
drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every expense can be deducted. The law does not permit a  
taxpayer to claim such non-prescription medications as nicotine 
patches or gum. Also, the total in medical expenses -- 
smoking-related or otherwise -- must reach 7.5 percent of a 
taxpayer's adjusted gross income in order to qualify as an itemized 
deduction. 
</P>
<P>
	But prescriptions, doctor bills or cessation programs offered by  
hospitals or other treatment facilities could be deducted, so long 
as they are not reimbursed by an employer or by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Eriksen said there are an increasing number of intensive  
programs available, including some at drug treatment centers that 
have added nicotine addiction. There are also more and more 
pharmaceutical options, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the right thing to do in terms of the dollar invested and  
the dollar saved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who paid for a smoking cessation program in recent  
years could file an amended return to claim those costs, 
particularly if they already had enough medical expenses to 
qualify. Other taxpayers should check past returns to figure if the 
smoking expenses reached the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income 
threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers can generally file an amended return for three years  
after the due date of the original return using IRS Form 1040X.

	Pact Signed Ending Kosovo Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 78 days of NATO bombing, Yugoslav  
generals signed a military pact yesterday outlining rules for the 
end of hostilities. Tens of thousands of Serb troops will leave 
Kosovo using approved routes and under a strict timetable, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 
it probably would take at least 24 hours after Serb troops begin 
withdrawing before the lead elements of the U.S. peacekeeping force 
could enter Kosovo. NATO began bombing to try to halt alleged Serb 
atrocities against Kosovo residents of Albanian ancestry. NATO 
planes have flown more than 34,000 missions over Yugoslavia. 

</P>
<P>
	New Grave Site Spotted in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aerial photographs taken weeks apart show what  
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon identified yesterday as a mass 
grave site in west-central Kosovo. The first picture, taken May 15, 
shows neat lines of what apparently are individual graves. The 
second, taken June 3, shows only a dark splotch where the graves 
had been. NATO and humanitarian groups have identified a half-dozen 
or more suspected mass grave sites in Kosovo, where Serb forces are 
accused of massacres, systematic rape and other atrocities against 
ethnic Albanians. NATO began bombing March 24 to stop alleged Serb 
aggression.

Indonesia's long tradition of vote-rigging was again plaguing the 
country. Election officials denied any improprieties, saying they 
have been swamped by the 113 million votes cast in Monday's 
parliamentary election, billed as the country's most democratic 
vote in 44 years. By today, unofficial results released to 
journalists showed that 8.2 percent of the votes had been

	New Moms Stay Longer in Hospital  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New mothers are staying in the hospital about  
half a day longer on average, says the first study since a public 
outcry over ``drive-by deliveries.'' The trend began even before a 
federal law requiring insurance coverage of 48-hour stays went into 
effect. In the early 1990s, many insurance companies began paying 
only for 24-hour hospital stays for vaginal childbirth, but doctors 
say first-time mothers who generally have longer labors and more 
questions about newborn care often need a second day. Following 
complaints about inadequate care, states began passing laws 
requiring insurance to pay for 48-hour stays.

17-13 last night. With one on and two outs in the fifth, McGwire 
hit a drive that witnesses said bounced off the last row of seats 
in the left-field bleachers and rolled almost to the concession 
stand. McGwire's second homer in two days and 19th of the year 
trailed only the 484-foot monster he hit on May 22 at Los Angeles

this postseason and stunned the Indiana Pacers 101-94 Wednesday 
night. The win gives the Knicks a 3-2 lead in the Eastern 
Conference finals and a chance to win the series at home Friday

<HEADLINE> Labonte Brings Momentum to Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- If success breeds success, Bobby Labonte  
figures to be the driver to beat in the NASCAR Kmart 400 at 
Michigan Speedway Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who won twice at this 2-mile banked oval in 1995, had  
been running well this season for the Joe Gibbs team. But he hadn't 
been winning until last week when he drove his Pontiac to a victory 
at Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence means a lot in racing, just like it does in other  
sports,'' Labonte said Thursday. ``We were able to build off past 
weeks to get to last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with coming in to Michigan with a win,  
no matter where it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The difference at Dover was a set of shocks Labonte borrowed  
from teammate Tony Stewart's car. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked so well that Labonte set a track record at Dover  
Downs International Speedway while earning the pole for the MBNA 
Platinum 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's setup for the Michigan track will be different, but no  
less important. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get your car set up right here,'' Labonte said.  
``That's the big thing, to get good power and a good setup. We've 
been fortunate, we've run well every time we've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte gives much of the credit to Jimmy Makar, his crew chief  
since 1995 when he joined the Gibbs team. 
</P>
<P>
	In his win at Dover, a key call by Makar played a major role in  
the triumph. Makar brought in Labonte to top off his fuel tank just 
before the end of the final caution period on lap 293. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just enough to get him to the finish.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like gas-mileage racing because you want to have the  
fastest car and run away,'' Labonte said. ``But it was a great call 
by Jimmy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cost Jeff Gordon the Dover race for the second  
straight year. He was forced to stop for a splash of gas with five 
laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is hoping to win on pure power at the bigger, faster  
track in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those deals where we like coming to this track,''  
Labonte said. ``It seems like we've got a good setup for it and 
good combination for it between Jimmy Makar and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is third in the Winston Cup point standings with 1,915.  
Dale Jarrett is first with 1,984 and Jeff Burton, a three-time 
winner, has 1,933 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been competitive week in and week out,'' Labonte said.  
``We've had some decent finishes, and we haven't had too much bad 
luck. We hope we can keep it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the defending champion in this race -- the 14th of  
34 this season -- is fourth in the standings with 1,854 points. 
Martin, after a career-best seven victories last year, has won only 
once this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gordon, he could be in the right place to start making  
things happen. Martin, second to Gordon last season, has won four 
times at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte's teammate, Stewart, is fifth with 1,700 points. Gordon,  
last year's Winston Cup points champion, is sixth with 1,645 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has had a run of bad luck lately, won at Michigan  
last August.

<HEADLINE> More People Shoud Use Hearing Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Do you frequently ask people to repeat  
themselves, have trouble following conversations at a party or get 
complaints about your loud TV? 
</P>
<P>
	You might need a hearing test.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts say hearing aids could help many of the 19 million  
Americans over age 45 who have hearing loss -- but an estimated 
three out of five patients over 65 and six of seven middle-aged 
patients don't use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? A major new survey of 2,300 hearing-impaired people found  
denial, embarrassment and cost all play a role. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say these people should take a closer look. They're no  
longer selling your grandfather's hearing aid. Just in the last two 
years, hearing-aid technology has boomed, with new digital models 
that can put the processing power of a laptop computer deep into 
the ear canal. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: Hearing aids can be very expensive -- from $700 for  
a good but no-frills traditional model to $5,000 for a pair of 
hidden-inside-the-ear digital aids -- and most insurance does not 
pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet demand is poised to surge as baby boomers age. Not only does  
hearing loss often come with aging, the baby boomers are suffering 
earlier than their parents did thanks to noisier surroundings. Loud 
music, jet planes, city traffic -- they all take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, as you're exposed to more and more noise, it's  
putting more stress on the auditory system,'' says audiologist Tomi 
Browne of Alexandria, Va. ``We are seeing more and more folks in 
their 40s and 50s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why no insurance coverage? Insurance traditionally pays ``for  
the catastrophic costs associated with illness,'' says Richard 
Coorsh of the Health Insurance Association of America. Adding 
hearing aids would be pricey. ``It boils down to whether a group 
wants to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But too many people don't realize hearing loss has serious  
health consequences, contends James Firman of the National Council 
on the Aging. The council's new survey of 2,300 hearing-impaired 
people found those without hearing aids were more likely to be 
depressed, anxious and isolated from society. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of nonusers said their hearing wasn't bad  
enough for an aid even though 36 percent did wonder why relatives, 
tired of repeating themselves, frequently snap at them. One in five 
said hearing aids would make them feel old or be embarrassing. Half 
cited cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Key to a good hearing aid is testing by a professional to  
uncover your type of hearing loss, and then getting an appropriate 
hearing aid fitted properly, said Harry Sauberman, who oversees 
hearing aids for the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not fit properly, the best hearing aid will not  
function,'' he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Your choices:  
</P>
<P>
	--Traditional analog aids amplify all sound.  
</P>
<P>
	--Programmable aids are computer programmed to match a patient's  
specific hearing loss. You may need only high-frequency sounds 
amplified, or need to hear conversation in a noisy restaurant 
without the background noise amplified. 
</P>
<P>
	--Digital aids are more computerized, automatically adapting to  
different listening environments for greater clarity. 
</P>
<P>
	Size varies dramatically. Aids that squeeze deep into the ear  
canal typically have enough power for moderate hearing loss and 
cannot be seen. But they have tiny batteries that need frequent 
replacement, a drawback for people with dexterity problems. 
Slightly bigger aids sit in the outer ear, and behind-the-ear 
models are very visible but may be vital for more severe hearing 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	While digitals and in-the-ear models are hot sellers, Sauberman  
cautions that only with hearing tests and trying on different 
models can you find the aid best for you. 
</P>
<P>
	You may need repeat visits to fine-tune and adjust the hearing  
aid for maximum performance. But in most states, you can return a 
hearing aid for a refund within 30 days if it does not fit or work 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Firman warns against buying cheaper mail-order hearing aids  
because there's no way to get a proper fit or fine-tuning. If a 
hearing aid is out of reach financially, groups like the Lions 
Clubs offer financial assistance in many cities, and hearing 
centers and aging organizations offer information on such programs. 
</P>
<P>
	And while hearing aids help significantly, they ``will never  
restore the normal hearing you once had,'' Sauberman cautions, 
saying too-high expectations often frustrate users.

<HEADLINE> North, South Korea Claim Same Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea issued competing  
claims today to a rich crab fishing ground in the Yellow Sea, where 
warships from both sides have been facing off this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Four North Korean patrol boats and 20 fishing boats sailed back  
into the disputed waters early today, 4 1/2 hours after six North 
Korean patrol boats escorting a larger fishing fleet withdrew from 
the area. All the boats withdrew late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's military said it was tightening security and  
warned that the dispute could escalate into an armed clash between 
the two nations, still technically at war 46 years after the Korean 
War ended without a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae did not order a  
heightened alert status for the military, and the 37,000 American 
troops stationed in South Korea also remained on normal alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry said four South Korean warships confronted  
the North's vessels today, but both sides appeared to be exercising 
restraint as Seoul sought a meeting with North Korean military 
officials to discuss the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Koreans rejected the meeting, which would have been  
arranged by the U.N. Command, a multinational military force that 
monitors the armistice between the two countries. But they withdrew 
all their ships from the disputed area late today. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest standoff was the third in as many days. The second  
confrontation, which began Wednesday, lasted 18 hours, while the 
first, on Tuesday, went on for 11 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naval patrol ships of the (North) Korean People's Army have  
been completely controlling and containing every movement of the 
South Korean warships in our territorial waters,'' the North's 
official Korean Central News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's Defense Ministry rejected the North's statement as  
``complete nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed waters lie between the North Korean mainland and  
five South Korean islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is within a neutral zone established by the U.N.  
Command in 1953 to avoid clashes. North Korea has sent fishing 
boats and naval ships into the zone 20 to 30 times a year, but 
usually withdrew them when challenged by South Korean navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, North Korea laid claim to waters around the five South  
Korean islands in the area and demanded that all southern shipping 
to and from those islands obtain its permission. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean warships had to escort ferries to and from the five  
island for months. The navy stopped the escorting after tension 
between the two Koreas eased. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and  
the capitalist South in 1945. Their border is the world's most 
heavily armed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Bob Knight Investigated in Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight's famous temper could land  
him in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana basketball coach, who was convicted of assaulting a  
policeman in Puerto Rico 20 years ago, could be charged with 
battery for allegedly choking a man who accused him of making a 
racist remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County prosecutor Carl Salzmann said Thursday he had not  
decided whether to file charges against Knight or possibly against 
the other man, Chris Foster, 38, a Bloomington guitar-maker, for 
provoking the confrontation in a restaurant parking lot Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said he was at a Mexican restaurant in nearby  
Ellettsville with a friend and couldn't help hearing Knight's 
profanity-laced conversation as the coach sat with his wife and her 
two sisters in the mostly-empty room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of all dialogue was sports-related stuff,  
baseball, basketball, names and statistics,'' Foster said. ``At one 
point, he made a comment that was basically, `When I have a black 
player who comes into some money, I tell him, `You buy your mother 
a house and you hang onto the rest of it,' because when one of 
those people comes into money, the rest of them come out of the 
woodwork.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, who is white, said he spoke to Knight as they were  
paying their bills and that he told Knight he found some of his 
remarks offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``By this time we're starting to walk out of the restaurant, so  
I repeat to him what he said, and he says, `That's not racist.' And 
I said, `Well I'm sorry but you obviously don't understand when you 
make a racist remark.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He starts screaming at me ... I don't even know what he's  
saying, he's screaming so loud at me. I told him, `Look, calm down, 
calm down,' and he just reaches up and grabs me by the throat and 
tries to pick me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the friend, Joseph Rheinhardt, 20, separated them, Foster  
returned to the restaurant and called police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him with his hand on Chris' throat,'' Rheinhardt said.  
``I batted his arm away and stepped between them. I was standing 
right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Foster called police, he went back outside and Knight was  
still there. The coach approached him again, saying, ``Do you want 
more of me?'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheinhardt stepped between them again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was nose-to-nose with him,'' Rheinhardt said. ``He wanted to  
get through me and to Chris. At some point, I put my hand up and he 
said, `Don't you touch me.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's co-owner and cashier said they didn't see what  
happened in the parking lot but didn't hear any unusually loud 
exchanges inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the other guy shouldn't have been listening to their  
conversation,'' co-owner Jacinto Coronel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashier Usiel Reyes said he was standing by the register when  
Foster confronted Knight but neither raised his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	A waiter also contradicted Foster's allegation, the prosecutor  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that it was a pleasant, quiet evening,'' Salzmann  
said. ``The only thing he saw outside the ordinary was a little 
girl from one of the other tables asking Bobby for his autograph, 
which he gave her. Nobody was being loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phone messages left for Knight, Indiana athletic director  
Clarence Doninger and the sports information staff were not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said it was ``strange'' that he might be charged with  
provoking the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just let it slide, you're tacitly approving (offensive  
remarks),'' he said. ``That's all I was trying to do. He engaged in 
the conversation with me freely. It wasn't until I told him he 
evidently didn't know a racist statement when he made one. If 
that's provoking or whatever, then I guess I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Knight was tried and convicted in absentia and  
sentenced to six months in jail for hitting a Puerto Rican 
policeman at the Pan American Games. Then-Gov. Otis Bowen refused 
to extradite Knight to Puerto Rico, which dropped its attempts to 
get him back eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, at the NCAA Final Four in Philadelphia, Knight was  
involved in a hotel shoving match with a Louisiana State fan, who 
told reporters Knight stuffed him in a garbage can. In 1985, he was 
ejected from a game after throwing a chair across the court during 
a game against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1992 NCAA tournament, Knight playfully gave a mock  
whipping to Calbert Cheaney, a black player, during practice. 
Knight denied any racial connotations to the prank and noted the 
bullwhip he used was given to him by the players, including 
Cheaney. The Hall of Fame coach also has been suspended or fined 
several times.

<HEADLINE> TBS To Launch Women's Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Turner Broadcasting System and two magazine  
publishers are launching a cable television channel aimed at women, 
challenging the successful Lifetime channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel, which has yet to be named, will be launched with an  
accompanying Web site early next year, the companies announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	TBS' partners are Time Inc., which like TBS is part of Time  
Warner, and Conde Nast, which is owned by the privately held 
Advance Publications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women represent the fastest-growing Internet population and a  
television audience that remains underserved,'' said Pat Mitchell, 
who will head the new channel. She now heads the production 
division at CNN that won a Peabody award for its series on the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new network will provide a destination exclusively for  
smart, active women seeking relevant content and community,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel will draw material from articles on style,  
entertaining, travel, food and parenting in various magazines 
published by Conde Nast (Mademoiselle, Vogue, Bride's, Glamour) and 
Time (People, InStyle, Parenting, Health, Food &AMP; Wine). 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the successful Lifetime channel, run by Walt Disney Co.  
and Hearst Corp., the new TBS channel faces competition from a 
channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk show host Oprah 
Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, a driving force at Nickelodeon.

<HEADLINE> Debt Blocks Some Women From College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The child care programs and flexible schedules  
that allow some mothers to succeed in the workplace could also 
bring them to college campuses, researchers who surveyed hundreds 
of prospective students said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would seem if any institution is to capture the student of  
the 21st century, it would have to be more responsive to these 
needs,'' said Maggie Ford, president of the American Association of 
University Women, which released a survey showing that debt, 
children, age and anxiety keep many women from pursuing college 
educations. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1,070 respondents to the group's national telephone  
survey this winter, women were more likely than men not to attend 
college initially because of their credit-card debt or lack of 
scholarships and other college aid. Another barrier to college 
cited by women more often than men was the need to care for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The respondents, all high school graduates, were questioned in  
December 1998 and January 1999. They represented three groups: 
those who went straight from high school to work in the previous 
few years; those who went directly from high school to college in 
the previous few years, and those who went from high school to work 
for at least a year and then to college. The work-to-college group 
had graduated from high school within the previous seven years. The 
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Women already in the work force were six times more likely than  
their male counterparts to think their ages could have been a 
barrier to college (18 percent of women, compared with 3 percent of 
men). Women going directly from high school to college worried more 
than men about college entrance exam scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The single biggest deterrent to attending college, however, was  
money. Both sexes cited it as a problem, but women in all three 
categories were more likely than men to be concerned that their 
credit card debt and lack of college aid would keep them out of 
school. Women in all groups also wanted better information about 
financial aid and child care support from colleges. Working women 
attending college for the first time were the most likely to want 
flexible class scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	Those surveyed found community colleges most responsive, Ford  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Haag, a senior AAUW researcher, also pointed to American  
University in Washington and Smith College in Northampton, Mass., 
for model programs that encourage mid-career enrollments. Such 
programs offer flexibility and special counseling, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As there are career changes and other transitions, there may  
be an element of necessity of being a student throughout one's 
life,'' said Haag, adding that 60 percent of college students over 
25 years old are women. ``These students bring great study skills 
and have a diverse population, which will result in more 
interesting, well-rounded research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that men and women had different reasons for  
going to college. Women were more likely to go for ``personal 
enrichment'' and interesting careers than men, who were more 
interested in getting the credential of a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, men were more likely than women to believe  
they could fare well without college degrees. And men were more 
positive about the work they were doing: 51 percent of men called 
their work a ``career'' rather than a ``job,'' compared with 26 
percent of women.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Tests TV's Fairness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the kind of feel-good national exposure  
most politicians can only dream of: a few minutes on the ``Today'' 
show, collecting musical instruments for charity while chatting 
with Katie Couric and Matt Lauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard work for a first lady. But now that Hillary Rodham  
Clinton has inched closer to a Senate candidacy, such appearances 
become an awkward test of how practices that ensure political 
fairness on TV apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all uncharted territory,'' said Jeff Zucker, executive  
producer of ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton consented to a brief sit-down interview with  
Couric, during which she revealed her enthusiasm for the New York 
Knicks. Her appearance was organized through Save the Music, a 
charity started by the cable network VH1 that distributes recycled 
musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outside the show's storefront studio in Rockefeller  
Center, she made small talk with the tourists who come to watch the 
show each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is beautiful. Is this yours?'' she asked a woman who was  
donating her grandmother's violin. Mrs. Clinton said she had 
already donated one of her husband's saxophones. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of fairness, Zucker said that he had unsuccessfully sought  
to have New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appear this week on 
the show. Giuliani, a Republican, is considered a possible opponent 
if Mrs. Clinton runs for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that she's a potential candidate, you do have to think of  
things like this,'' he said, ``and we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at ABC briefly talked about the impact on a  
prospective campaign when ``Good Morning America'' was invited to 
televise a town meeting on teen violence from the White House two 
weeks ago with President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The importance of the issue in the wake of Littleton outweighed  
the political considerations, said ABC News President David Westin. 
Future decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, one of the factors we will take into account is if  
it is more a matter of image in a political race or if it's 
newsworthy,'' he said. ``If it's newsworthy, we have to cover it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal equal time provisions, which ensure broadcasters give  
fair exposure to candidates, didn't apply to Mrs. Clinton's 
``Today'' appearance on Thursday for three reasons, said Andrew J. 
Schwartzman, president of the Washington-based Media Access 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules don't kick in until a person is a declared candidate.  
Even if Mrs. Clinton had declared, only other Democrats would be 
entitled to equal time until the party determines its nominee, 
Schwartzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NBC has a Federal Communications Commission  
exemption for the ``Today'' show that affects most political 
interviews, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is clearly benefiting from a journalistic  
honeymoon, said Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media 
and Public Affairs in Washington. In recent months, evening news 
shows have run 28 stories about her potential Senate candidacy and 
six stories about Vice President Gore's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think the morning news shows would act more like  
journalism instead of entertainment puff shows,'' Lichter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zucker said if Mrs. Clinton appears on ``Today'' again, it will  
be in a political interview.

<HEADLINE> Olson's Struggles Hurt Diamondbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gregg Olson's recurring late-inning failures have  
created a big problem for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who aren't sure 
where to turn for relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson's six blown saves in 14 chances have left manager Buck  
Showalter with no certain closer, a gaping hole for an ambitious 
team that thinks it can make the playoffs in just its second year 
of existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we've struggled in those situations this year,''  
Showalter said. ``We're going to take each situation as it comes. 
Oly has pitched real well at times and has struggled at times. I'm 
well aware of that, and it's a job you can't afford to have a lot 
of inconsistency in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That inconsistency was never more apparent than Tuesday night  
against the Chicago Cubs, when Olson entered with a runner at 
third, no outs and Arizona ahead 3-2. Olson struck out Sammy Sosa 
and got Glenallen Hill to pop out. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked Henry Rodriguez intentionally, then threw a fat pitch  
over the plate that pinch-hitter Tyler Houston sent over the 
right-field fence for a three-run homer. The Cubs went on to win 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	If they give up on Olson, whose confidence seems to be shaken,  
the Diamondbacks aren't loaded with options. There aren't any 
proven closers out there to be acquired, and Arizona's young farm 
system isn't loaded with prospects. The Diamondbacks are extremely 
reluctant to give up any of the few they have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at all the options to address it,'' general  
manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``We're looking at every way to go 
at it, whether it's from within or looking at other teams. But 
people who have good closers, they're not anxious to give them 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks might try to pry away a reliever from one of  
the teams that have depth in the bullpen, such as Cincinnati, 
Pittsburgh or the New York Mets. But there's no guarantee that 
pitcher would be any better than Olson, who has 211 career saves. 
</P>
<P>
	When Showalter has gone to someone other than Olson, the results  
have been mixed. As a team, Arizona has blown 10 of 21 save 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	The most intriguing prospect is 20-year-old South Korean  
Byung-Hyun Kim, who has a nasty sidearm delivery, an apparent 
abundance of confidence and about four different sliders that 
either rise or fall as they cross the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has had some big success in his few save appearances, but  
has been hit hard at times. He also had the odd fortune of being 
thrown out of the game Wednesday night when a bandage reeking of 
analgesic balm flew out of his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim started the season in Double-A, quickly rose to Triple-A and  
was with the big club before May ended. Showalter has liked Kim 
from the start but is torn about how quickly to use him as a 
closer. Logic would say to break him in slowly, as the Diamondbacks 
have done with Vladimir Nunez, who got his first career save in 
Arizona's 8-7 victory over Chicago Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought Vlade in stages. We're trying to that with Kim,''  
Showalter said. ``And he already has had failure. You've got to ask 
yourself do you do harm in the long-run. It's a tough situation. 
There are a lot of things to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he got the save Wednesday, Nunez was hit hard twice.  
Matt Williams made a diving catch of a line drive on one of the 
hits and the other was a fly ball to deep center that Steve Finley 
chased down. 
</P>
<P>
	Another option might be Darren Holmes, the closer for Colorado a  
couple of seasons ago but usually used as a set-up man by the 
Diamondbacks. Holmes, too, has had some dramatic failures this 
year. He's blown saves in both his opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes says as far as he's concerned, the job still belongs to  
Olson. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are throwing daggers, but nobody knows what it's like  
to be in that position unless you've been in it,'' Holmes said. 
``You're a hero or a goat. I was talking to Oly today and I said of 
our last three losses, I have two and you have one, and we were 
this close to being heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He held his fingers a centimeter or so apart to show the margin  
of error for the guy who takes the mound in the ninth inning to 
hold on to a narrow lead.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Diocese Settles Neglect Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- The Catholic Diocese of Venice will  
pay $500,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging church officials failed 
to prevent an altar boy from being molested by a priest and choir 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The diocese also has agreed to pay for any future psychological  
counseling for the former altar boy, his attorney Sheldon Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The diocese acknowledged that the former altar boy, now 22, was  
molested by the Rev. Ed McLoughlin -- then assistant pastor of St. 
Charles Borromeo Catholic Church -- and former choir director 
Richard Trepinski. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claimed that the bishop of the diocese, John Nevins,  
and the Rev. Nicholas McLoughlin, pastor of the church, failed to 
prevent the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The men allegedly knew the Trepinski and Ed McLoughlin had  
propensities to molest young boys yet allowed them unsupervised 
contact with youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Trepinski pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor in 1993 and  
was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Ed McLoughlin has been living 
in Ireland and relieved of active duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints against Ed McLoughlin go back to the early 1980s when  
he was an assistant pastor in Venice, the lawsuit claimed. He was 
sent to St. Charles Borromeo so his brother, pastor Nicholas 
McLoughlin, could watch over him, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim said Trepinski began molesting him in 1991 when he  
was 13. When he confided in Ed McLoughlin about the abuse, the 
priest said he needed to be punished and spanked him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed McLoughlin then began molesting him, the victim said, and the  
abuse continued for 2 1/2 years.

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Ponder Returning to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Although she doesn't know when she'll  
be allowed to return to Kosovo, refugee Fatimire Zhubi knows what 
she'll do when she arrives: get down to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they're going to organize it all,'' Zhubi, a  
pediatrician, said during a pause from examining squirming children 
in a refugee camp clinic. ``But we'll start working as soon as we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and other ethnic Albanian refugees know that the challenge  
will be immense to rebuild their homeland, poor and scarred by 
fighting even before NATO started bombing in March and the worst of 
the ethnic purges began. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that at least  
350,000 houses in Kosovo have been seriously damaged. The U.N. 
Children's Fund says massive damage was inflicted on hospitals, 
clinics and schools. Doctors, nurses and teachers are in severely

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Ponder Returning to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Although she doesn't know when she'll  
be allowed to return to Kosovo, refugee Fatimire Zhubi knows what 
she'll do when she arrives: get down to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they're going to organize it all,'' Zhubi, a  
pediatrician, said during a pause from examining squirming children 
in a refugee camp clinic. ``But we'll start working as soon as we 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and other ethnic Albanian refugees know that the challenge  
will be immense to rebuild their homeland, poor and scarred by 
fighting even before NATO started bombing in March and the worst of 
the ethnic purges began. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that at least  
350,000 houses in Kosovo have been seriously damaged. The U.N. 
Children's Fund says massive damage was inflicted on hospitals, 
clinics and schools. Doctors, nurses and teachers are in severely 
short supply.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Effects of Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are questioning the practice  
promoted in recent years of allowing many wildfires to burn, saying 
it makes a big difference whether the fire is in mountain woods, a 
deep rainforest or brushland. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few decades forest managers have come to the  
conclusion that suppressing naturally occurring fires can lead to a 
buildup of dry wood and leaves in forests, providing fuel for 
bigger fires in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	This was violently illustrated in 1988 when blazes roared out of  
control through Yellowstone National Park after years of being held 
in check. 
</P>
<P>
	But two studies appearing in Friday's edition of the journal  
Science conclude that at least in certain ecosystems -- the 
Brazilian rainforest and California brushland -- it is better to 
fight fires. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until 1968 the Park Service followed a policy of suppressing  
all fires,'' said National Park Service spokeswoman Elaine Sevy. 
But scientists began to realize that fire is a natural process that 
can keep an ecosystem healthy. Some plants, such as lodgepole 
pines, need fire to open their cones and allow seeds to plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Denny Truesdale of the U.S. Forest Service said the same general  
policy applies to all federal land management agencies and was 
reaffirmed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of those ecosystems require periodic fire to maintain  
their natural historic state,'' he said. Allowing smaller fires to 
burn eliminated the fuel that could cause bigger blazes later. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Truesdale added, the need to prevent danger to people  
and property means that many fires still are suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	A policy that works for the forests does not fare so well in  
Brazil's rainforest or California's brushland, concluded the 
Science papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're talking about forested ecosystems in the  
mountains, this is a very different problem than with brushland, 
and this hasn't previously been recognized,'' said Jon E. Keeley of 
the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Resources Division in Three 
Rivers, Calif., lead author of one of the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike northern forests where fires were bigger but less  
frequent as a result of firefighting, blazes in the brushland have 
increased over the years despite efforts to battle them, the 
researchers found. The increase parallels population growth, Keeley 
said, with blazes being started by smokers, arsonists, campers and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	In brushland areas, he said, ``large, catastrophic fires are not  
an artifact of fire suppression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, these blazes usually occur during dry periods when the  
powerful Santa Ana winds blow from the desert fanning the flames 
which consume everything in their path. 
</P>
<P>
	Many brushland managers set controlled blazes to create a mosaic  
of old and new growth shrubs in the belief that the younger plants 
are less flammable and will block the spread of natural fires. But 
Keeley's researchers found that the age of plants made no 
difference in the large, wind-driven blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean that prescription burning will not have some  
beneficial effect,'' he said. ``Under moderate conditions ... it's 
an effective management strategy, but it's not going to stop large 
fires,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeley's team concluded officials should concentrate on battling  
fires in zones between urban and wild areas rather than focusing on 
controlled burns. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Brazilian rainforest natural fires are very rare, said  
Mark A. Cochrane of the Woods Hole Research Center, lead author of 
the second paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Because these forests hardly ever have experienced fire, they  
have not developed thick bark to resist it as northern trees have, 
he explained in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, even a small fire can cause the death of 40 percent or  
more of the trees. And now you have dead trees dropping leaves and 
branches and falling over. That increases the fuel and opens the 
(forest) canopy, which allows the sun in and dries the forest,'' 
making it susceptible to another blaze, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	A second fire will then be even hotter, killing larger trees,  
and if the area burns a third time it can be reduced to grassland 
and scrub, eliminating nearly all trees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over history, natural fires in the rainforest have occurred only  
once in hundreds of years, Cochrane said, while now farmers and 
construction crews are opening areas, making them more susceptible 
to being set ablaze. Fires now occur in many areas every seven to 
14 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochrane and his team concluded that if wildfires continue to  
burn at the current rate the rainforest eventually will turn 
irreversibly into grassland.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Faces Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- For the first time since she began  
exploring a possible run for the Senate from New York, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton has been greeted by protesters carrying 
``Carpetbagger Go Home'' signs. 
</P>
<P>
	With about three dozen demonstrators shouting from across the  
street outside a Lockheed Martin plant she had visited just outside 
Binghamton, Mrs. Clinton told reporters Wednesday that such 
protests were simply a ``fact of political life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she was she had chosen the state for her possible  
Senate run, she said: ``New York really is the Empire State and is 
a state that is on the cutting edge of where we're going in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, born in Illinois and a former first lady of  
Arkansas, has never lived or worked in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the plant, she told about 40 employees, handpicked by  
company officials for a discussion with Mrs. Clinton about job 
creation and other economic issues, that the nation has been so 
successful ``because of people who have been willing to try new 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many people locked into old thinking. ... We are  
all such prisoners of our past,'' the first lady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her impromptu news conference outside the plant reflected how  
seriously Mrs. Clinton is taking the Senate race. Her advisers have 
been encouraging such interaction with the media as she travels 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	While the subject of Mrs. Clinton's possible candidacy never  
came up during the almost one-hour question-and-answer session with 
the plant employees, it did demonstrate a lacking in her high-tech 
expertise. When one worker asked her why the federal government 
wasn't doing more to advance mag lev technology, she responded, 
``Could you tell me what that technology is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mag lev, short for magnetic levitation, can be used to reduce  
the friction of rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Clinton's 11th visit to New York this year and her  
first since announcing Friday she would form an exploratory 
committee to continue preparations for the Senate race her advisers 
expect her to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	The race could pit Mrs. Clinton against Republican New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who formed an exploratory committee in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's latest New York foray continued Wednesday  
evening with a fund-raiser for Rep. Maurice Hinchey at a Binghamton 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	While about 300 people attended the fund-raiser for the  
Democratic congressman, a dozen or so protesters were outside and 
office building windows overlooking the hotel were adorned with 
several anti-Clinton signs. One read: ``Hillary Clinton is not 
qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said the  
protesters ``seemed more coordinated'' than during past appearances 
by the first lady in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton then flew to New York City for a $5,000-a-person  
dinner organized by financial writer Andrew Tobias at a private 
home. The event, aimed at gay and lesbian campaign contributors, 
was expected to raise at least $200,000 for the Democratic National 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Corn, Soybeans Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices advanced early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat bounced higher after heavy rainfall fell in winter wheat  
growing regions. That likely will delay some harvesting of mature 
crops and leave them vulnerable to pests. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans were pressured by forecasts for beneficial  
rainfall in Midwest growing regions, which should prove timely 
after several days of above-average temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.56 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.20 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1/2 cent to 
$1.25 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.70 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .20 cent to 66.52 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .30 cent to 77.57 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .42 cent to 50.35 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.25 
cents to 48.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Woman Arrested Over Library Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who borrowed seven library books  
to read to her 2-year-old son was handcuffed and arrested when they 
became more than a year overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	For each of the missing seven titles, Davis was charged with a  
count of failing to show up in court to account for the overdue 
books. She faced an $82 fine for each book plus $791 in bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabrina Davis, 22, admitted she failed to return the Clearwater  
Library books on time, but said she couldn't afford the late fees. 
She was arrested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were dropped Tuesday when her boyfriend returned the  
books. Davis was released after spending a night in jail and 
promising to pay $220 in court costs by Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an experience for me,'' she said. ``I've never been  
arrested. I've never been handcuffed. I've never been behind 
bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they usually resort to arrests after a patron  
fails to heed eight written or telephone notices over about 18 
months. Davis was ordered to come to court in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people return the materials once they receive a notice to  
appear in court, to avoid substantial fines, Assistant City 
Attorney Rob Surette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, the cases of 87 patrons have been referred to the  
court system, library director Arlita Hallam said.

<HEADLINE> More People Using Mobile Telephones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of subscribers to mobile telephone  
services in the United States increased to 68 million in 1998, up 
from 55 million the previous year, the Federal Communications 
Commission reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its fourth annual report on competition in the wireless  
industry, the FCC found an increasing number of customers in the 
mobile phones market -- which includes traditional cellular 
companies, a more sophisticated service called personal 
communications and digital mobile radio services. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also pointed to an increasing number of providers  
of such services, leading to lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there were once only two providers, there are now  
communities with five, six and even seven carriers trying to sell 
their services,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The mobile telephone market also generated more than $32 billion  
in revenues in 1998, according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of pagers also continued to grow. According to the report,  
the number of pagers in service last year ranged from 50 million to 
54 million, compared with 48 million in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elie Compares Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Although Mario Elie won two championships  
with the Houston Rockets, heading into the NBA Finals with the San 
Antonio Spurs is a new experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have a larger cast of contributors. They've lost only  
once so far in the playoffs, and they've got a unique chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mostly unity,'' Elie said Thursday. ``We're playing well.  
We're all on the same page. We're a confident team. We're feeling 
good about ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio, after sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers 4-0 to  
win the Western Conference title, must await the winner of the 
Eastern final between New York and Indiana. The Knicks lead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Finals begin Wednesday at the Alamodome.  
</P>
<P>
	Elie joined the Spurs as a free agent this season, coming from  
Houston, where he played on the 1994 and 1995 title teams. The 
Rockets defeated New York in seven games to win the NBA 
championship in 1994 and beat Orlando 4-0 to win in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Battling the Knicks again in the finals would be fun, said Elie,  
a New York native who grew up five minutes from Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to go back and play against the home team,'' he said.  
``I won my first championship against the Knicks. So it'd be nice 
to go there and know I'm going to play more, have a bigger role 
this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie took over the starting job at off-guard after the season  
began, replacing Jaren Jackson, who now comes off the bench and has 
been an offensive force in several Spurs' playoff victories. 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage the Spurs have had is getting point production  
consistently from several players. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Houston, you'd know who's going to deliver every night --  
Clyde (Drexler) and Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) are always going to put 
up some numbers,'' Elie said, adding that several other Houston 
players stepped up and produced in certain games. 
</P>
<P>
	The same is true with the Spurs, but more so, Elie said.  
</P>
<P>
	``On this team, we just ride the hot hand,'' he said. ``If a  
guy's hot, we keep going to him. Everybody's contributing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich agrees that's been part of the Spurs'  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to rely on one person to get everything done  
every night,'' he said. ``That does help us since we've got a lot 
of people who are willing to step up and to share in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going 6-8 in February, San Antonio went 31-5 the rest of  
the regular season to finish with the league's best record and 
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs are 11-1 in the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	On Elie's Houston championship teams, the Rockets lost a few  
games in the early rounds. The fact that San Antonio is winning so 
much makes for high expectations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary,'' he said. ``We swept two good teams and everybody  
expects us to sweep again, but it's tough. It's ... a lot of 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Will Perdue and Steve Kerr, who bring championship  
experience from their time with the Chicago Bulls, Elie is trying 
to prepare his teammates for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	He feels fortunate to have another chance at a title.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been lucky,'' he said. ``I've been blessed getting on  
these good teams. I thought this was the best situation for me. It 
turned out to be terrific. I'm in the finals. I've got a chance to 
win three. It looks good.''

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Big Pyramid Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Syracuse businessman Patrick Bennett was  
convicted Thursday of charges that he orchestrated a huge pyramid 
scheme and was immediately sent to prison by a judge who said he 
had proven he ``has absolutely no respect for any law of any 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Bennett of cheating more than 22,000  
investors out of $700 million in a case spanning two trials in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The first jury to hear the case convicted Bennett of perjury and  
obstructing a federal investigation of his company but could not 
reach a verdict on the rest of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``He committed gross fraud. He committed perjury in every stage  
of the proceeding. ... Clearly this trial has showed that Patrick 
R. Bennett is a total amoral individual who engaged in any criminal 
conduct that benefits him in any way,'' U.S. District Judge John S. 
Martin Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came after a jury found Bennett, 46, of Vernon,  
N.Y., guilty of 42 counts, including securities fraud and money 
laundering. The jury did not reach a verdict on 11 counts, 
including the most serious charge of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Smith said Bennett faces  
at least 20 years in prison, in part because he had been convicted 
of laundering at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Smith said, Bennett continued to live lavishly on a  
100-acre horse farm in his wife's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawns are freshly mowed, there are horses galloping in the  
pasture, and you have to really ask where did that money come 
from,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's convictions, bail was revoked and Bennett was  
ordered taken into custody pending sentencing Sept. 13. He stood in 
court along with his wife, both of them sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Bennett of using Bennett Funding Group  
to entice investors in 46 states into investing in leases for 
office equipment that sometimes did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett then pocketed more than $13 million for himself, buying  
Vernon Downs racetrack near Syracuse, prosecutors said. They 
alleged he also spent lavishly, including $19 million for a 
gambling barge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had admitted that he lied to the Securities and Exchange  
Commission after the watchdog agency began investigating the 
company in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The lies, prosecutors said, stalled the SEC until March 1996,  
causing investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's verdict shows that Patrick R. Bennett conducted  
perhaps the largest financial fraud in United States history,'' 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement. ``This scheme was 
particularly egregious because it victimized thousands of investors 
who believed the investments were among the most secure available 
in our securities markets.''

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas on Storage News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures fell sharply Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after figures showed a surprising increase in 
storage last week despite above-normal temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy futures also retreated. On other markets, silver  
futures rose sharply, while wheat advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gas Association reported inventories jumped by 91  
billion cubic feet, or 5.3 percent, last week. That puts storage 
levels virtually on par with last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was the largest increase in nearly a year and comes at a  
time when demand from utilities for natural gas to power generators 
is expected to increase. Natural gas demand typically rises sharply 
with the advent of hot or cold weather, as Americans turn on air 
conditioners and fans or heaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures traded also were surprised earlier this week by  
increases in crude inventories and by an unexpected decline in 
unleaded gasoline demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The storage figures cast a pall over a market that had shown  
signs of resiliency amid expectations of hotter weather and 
producer cutbacks could finally combine to reduce large U.S. 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants ignored the possibility next week of a  
Venezuelan oil workers strike, which could sharply restrict the 
flow of crude to the United States in the short-term. Venezuela and 
Saudi Arabia are the largest importers to the United States, with 
Venezuela shipping more than 60 percent of its output northward. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for July delivery fell 10.5 cents to $2.355 for each  
1,000 cubic feet. July crude fell 14 cents to $17.85 a barrel; July 
unleaded gasoline fell .71 cent to 51.53 cents a gallon; July 
heating oil fell .19 cent to 42.74 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
amid optimism a rebound in the Japanese economy will signal renewed 
demand from Asia for jewelry and photographic silver supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan reported a surprisingly strong rebound in its economy  
during the first three months of the year, which fueled hopes that 
a general recovery in Asia, where consumption fell 13 percent last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were supported by a decline in warehouse inventories  
held by the New York exchange to their lowest level since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver for July delivery rose 6.8 cents to $5.095 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after heavy  
rains fell in winter wheat growing areas, further delaying 
harvesting of mature crops and leaving them more vulnerable to 
disease and pests. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 4 3/4 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Expands Internet Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz is  
expanding his collection of Internet investments by partnering to 
buy a controlling interest in Scour.Net, a search engine that 
locates video, audio and picture files on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his investment partner Yucaipa Cos. -- the holding  
company led by Ron Burkle, a former grocery store magnate -- 
announced Thursday that they purchased 51 percent of Scour.Net for 
an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks the third joint Internet venture for Ovitz and  
Yucaipa Cos. since the Beverly Hills-based holding company hired 
former Disney Online President Richard Wolpert to lead its 
high-tech investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The group holds minority interests in the online game company  
GameSpy Industries and is developing CheckOut.com, an electronic 
commerce site. 
</P>
<P>
	Scour.Net is designed to allow users to quickly download music,  
video clips and images from movies, television shows and other 
entertainment venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolpert and Peter Levin, a partner in Ovitz's technology  
investments, will become members of Scour.Net's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The various sites that comprise the Ovitz-Yucaipa ventures will  
be linked, but will operate independently, Wolpert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scour.Net was created in 1997 by five computer students at the  
University of California, Los Angeles and is a unit of Los 
Angeles-based Scour Inc. The Ovitz-Yucaipa stake is limited to the 
Web site and does not include an equity share of Scour Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This investment will help us forge ahead to bring on new  
strategic partners which will allow us to further expand and grow 
Scour.Net,'' said Dan Rodrigues, CEO of Scour.Net. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz, founder of Creative Artists Agency, was once known as the  
most powerful man in Hollywood. He left CAA to become president of 
The Walt Disney Co. Ovitz left Disney less than a year after taking 
the post because of a falling out with Disney Chairman Michael 
Eisner. After leaving Disney, he founded Artists Management Group, 
whose clients include director Martin Scorsese, Robin Williams, 
Marisa Tomei and Mimi Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz also is leading one of two competing groups seeking to  
bring a National Football League franchise to Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Down 'Street Gang' Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chicago went too far in its fight against  
street gangs by ordering police to break up groups of loiterers, 
the Supreme Court ruled Thursday, striking down the city's law 
despite pleas from the Clinton administration, 31 states and many 
mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	The court deemed as unconstitutionally vague the anti-loitering  
ordinance that resulted in 45,000 arrests in the three years it was 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the  
dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty,'' 
even if it did reduce crime, Justice John Paul Stevens said in the 
court's main opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Supreme Court previously had invalidated the  
ordinance and blocked its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday' 6-3 ruling spurred six separate opinions and deep  
disagreement among the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, the highest court's only Chicago native, wrote for the  
majority that the ordinance gave police officers too much 
discretion to arrest people who never belonged to any gang. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Clarence Thomas, a dissenter, said he feared the  
court ``has unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to lives 
of terror and misery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another dissenter, Justice Antonin Scalia, chastised the court  
for ``elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the court long has barred communities from using  
anti-loitering laws to discriminate against racial minorities by, 
for example, trying to keep blacks out of some towns or 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grateful ... that it is not a criminal activity simply  
to be a young man of color gathered with friends on the streets of 
Chicago,'' said Harvey Grossman, the American Civil Liberties Union 
lawyer who successfully challenged the ordinance. ``Such laws are 
likely to be enforced in a discriminatory manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Thomas, the court's only black justice and one of its  
consistently conservative voices, cited far different concerns for 
innocent minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who suffer from our lofty pronouncements are people  
... who have seen their neighborhoods literally destroyed by gangs 
and violence and drugs,'' he said. ``They are good, decent people 
who must struggle to overcome their desperate situation, against 
all odds, in order to raise their families, earn a living and 
remain good citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 ordinance required police to order any group of people  
standing around with no apparent purpose to move along if an 
officer believed at least one of them belonged to a street gang. 
Those who disregarded the order would be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal  
sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order,'' Stevens 
said, ``if the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent, the 
dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing that police were not required to ask the purpose of  
any perceived loitering, Stevens said, ``It matters not whether the 
reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter 
near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a 
glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``In either, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police  
officer, she may -- indeed, she 'shall' -- order them to disperse,'' 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia took a page out of ``West Side Story'' in his dissenting  
opinion, complete with gang member Tony, Officer Krupke and the 
Jets' ``speculative discussion (probably irrelevant here) over 
whether the Jets are depraved because they are deprived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Krupke arrests the group for rudely failing to obey his order  
to disperse, Scalia wrote, ``I find it hard to believe that the 
Jets would not have known they had it coming,'' 
</P>
<P>
	City attorney Lawrence Rosenthal told the court in December that  
gang crime is ``different from every other form of criminal 
activity'' because street gangs ``rely on their ability to 
terrorize the community'' with their mere presence. By the time 
police officers arrive, he said, all they see are gang members 
``pretending to innocently loiter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the ``serious and difficult problems'' street  
gangs cause, the court said Chicago has numerous other laws and 
strategies to use against gang intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Daley said the city will try to draft a new  
ordinance, and Illinois Gov. George Ryan said Daley and other city 
officials who were just trying to keep the streets safe will devise 
a new plan that will withstand constitutional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Stevens in finding fatal flaws in the Chicago ordinance  
were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. 
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, Kennedy and Breyer also wrote separately to explain  
their views. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was the third dissenter. He  
and Scalia signed on to Thomas' impassioned dissenting opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago controversy had been among the most closely watched  
cases of the Supreme Court's 1998-99 term, scheduled to end this 
month. The National League of Cities, U.S. Mayors Conference and 
National Governors Association all weighed in on Chicago's side. 
The ordinance's opponents included the NAACP and other civil rights 
groups, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty and the 
National Black Police Association. 
</P>
<P>
	There is broad disagreement over how many street gang members  
reside in Chicago. City police estimated gang membership might 
total 10,000, but the court was told federal prosecutors believe 
the total might be closer to 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Gene Map May Be Completed by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal project to completely map the  
human genetic pattern could be complete by 2002, a year earlier 
than last predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers around the world trying to catalog all of the 60,000  
to 90,000 genes in human DNA are making rapid progress that could 
bump up the completion date, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of 
the National Human Genome Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 2002 is pretty realistic at this point,'' Collins said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Identifying all the human genes will make it possible to treat  
or prevent cancer, inherited disorders and some diseases, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Once genes are located, researchers can determine what proteins  
they make and use that knowledge to correct problems caused by 
mutated or inherited genes. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal project is competing with a privately funded effort  
by Rockville, Md.-based Celera Genomics, scheduled for completion 
by the end of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Genes discovered by private enterprise could be reserved briefly  
for exclusive use. Genes discovered by the federal researchers are 
released immediately into the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
	Celera likely will pursue patents on between 100 and 300 genes,  
said Dr. Paul Gilman, the company's director of policy planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're racing to do it, they're racing to do it. We're not  
racing against each other,'' Gilman said. ``We're racing to that 
point where people are able to do good things.''

<HEADLINE> Vets are Detectives at D.C. Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The white fuzz all over the pink-toe tarantula  
was a telltale clue. 
</P>
<P>
	A fungus, most likely. A sign of the infection that probably  
killed the hairy creature, Dr. Richard Montali said as he glanced 
over paperwork on the lifeless spider. Tissues will be collected 
and blood smeared onto slides -- and both will be preserved if 
needed for future research. 
</P>
<P>
	As the chief pathologist for the Smithsonian's National Zoo,  
Montali confronts death routinely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any given day we might have a fish or a bat and a spiny mouse  
and a lobster. Some invertebrate. We might have a snake,'' he said. 
``People think in terms of lions and tigers and rhinos and 
elephants and that's very rare. ... They have pretty long lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo pathologists play crucial roles in keeping the exotic  
animals on display healthy -- often uncovering new diseases that 
threaten animals in zoos nationwide and even preventing extinction 
in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of them as veterinarian detectives, working in a lab  
nestled behind the menagerie of lions, tigers and bears that get 
all the regular visitors. Montali's workshop is an entirely 
separate animal kingdom, one with a hospital, various laboratories 
and numerous veterinarian colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The information gathered by pathologists comes not only from  
their own zoos but from veterinarians and researchers throughout 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can receive tissues from Mongolia because we have field  
researchers in 300 projects in 50 countries,'' said Tracey 
McNamara, chief pathologist at the Bronx Zoo in New York. ``I work 
on tissues on penguins from Patagonia, from dolphins in Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo animals need different attention than the average household  
pet, McNamara said, and vets still have much to learn about these 
animals, many of which are experts at masking diseases from their 
curators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not like a domestic dog,'' she said. ``They're not  
going to go up and whimper to the keeper. Sometimes animals are 
simply found dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the slipper lobster found on its back in the aquarium.  
</P>
<P>
	In its case, an autopsy yielded a preliminary diagnosis. A  
curator had noted the lobster had not been eating. The creature's 
flat claws and lack of body fat further suggested it died from 
malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we can tell immediately, if there's some kind of  
obvious injury, or a twist of the intestines or something 
visible,'' Montali said, watching a vet resident examine a 
short-tail bat that apparently died after flying into something. 
``But often we don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsies are performed in a building where the stench of  
formaldehyde and carcasses clings in the air. Here, among the steel 
gurneys and subzero freezers, pathologists look for clues among the 
dead, collecting tissue samples and slides to examine under the 
microscope. 
</P>
<P>
	The information is then cataloged in a database that goes back  
several decades and is linked to zoos nationwide. Samples are often 
frozen for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Montali and an associate discovered a type of herpes  
virus that killed Kumari, the first elephant born at the National 
Zoo. Kumari died from a brief and unknown illness in 1995, 16 
months after she was born. Another apparent victim, 18-month old 
Astor, died in 1983 at the Bronx Zoo. Vets had no idea what killed 
these animals at the time but later tests of preserved tissue 
samples revealed the same herpes virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Montali's work also helped prevent golden lion tamarins from  
disappearing in Brazilian forests. Scientists had planned to 
propagate the South American monkeys in captivity and reintroduce 
them into the wild, but an unknown disease got in the way. About a 
dozen zoos reported similar outbreaks of the mysterious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Montali worked with other veterinarians and physicians to  
pinpoint a cause, eventually identifying a virus similar to the one 
that causes hepatitis. In humans, the virus causes meningitis and 
affects the brain. In tamarins, it destroys the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a disease is pinpointed, finding its cure or a treatment  
can be just as difficult. An antidote for one species doesn't 
necessarily work for another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the vaccines available for domestic animals -- say,  
canine distemper vaccine -- are very effective in dogs,'' McNamara 
said. ``But if you give that vaccine to red pandas, and they're 
very susceptible to (distemper), it actually induces disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of accredited zoos have their pathology  
departments, mainly because most zoos are nonprofit organizations 
that can't afford full-time pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those few of us working full-time in the field are  
understaffed and overworked,'' McNamara said.

<HEADLINE> Fox, Cable Fight Cuts Baseball Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A contract dispute between Fox Sports West  
and a cable TV company has tossed a curve to more than 90,000 
Southern California viewers who now are deprived of Dodgers and 
Angels games. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the TV season could end early for more fans of the  
baseball teams if other cable companies decide against paying Fox a 
surcharge to show additional games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox pulled the plug Saturday on channels Fox Sports West 1 and 2  
to 90,000 Marcus Cable customers in Glendale, Burbank and La Canada 
Flintridge. The signal to Whittier also was cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is simple, said Fox spokesman Vince Wladika: Marcus  
reduced its per-customer payments to Fox about three months ago, a 
violation of their two-year-old contract that runs through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole situation is unfortunate, but the entire situation  
was caused by Marcus,'' Wladika said Thursday, declining to provide 
contract details. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus blamed Fox. The cable company, which merged with cable  
giant Charter Communications last summer, said Fox is gouging the 
cable industry because of huge sports expenditures by sister News 
Corp. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been bargaining in good faith,'' Marcus Cable regional  
manager Tom Belcher said. ``Fox is working hard to offset 
investments like Kevin Brown's $100 million-plus contract with the 
Fox-owned Los Angeles Dodgers and broadcast rights for the Super 
Bowl by raising rates and adding surcharges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Century, Cox and TCI and satellite service DirecTV have  
paid the surcharge for 40 more Dodgers games and 20 more Angels 
contests. Charter, Media One, Comcast and Time-Warner remained in 
negotiations Thursday, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable customers shouldn't have to subsidize a ``lack of fiscal  
responsibility'' by broadcasters bidding to air sports events, 
Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wladika scoffed at Marcus' position.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a feeble, ludicrous and just plain stupid attempt to  
tie two unrelated subjects together,'' he said. Enterprises such as 
the Dodgers and Fox Sports, although part of Rupert Murdoch's News 
Corp. empire, are entirely separate, Wladika said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus' request for a temporary restraining order aimed at  
restoring the sports programming was rejected Sunday by U.S. 
District Judge Terry Hatter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marcus-Fox Sports contract has been voided by Marcus'  
action, Wladika said, adding that a new agreement must be 
negotiated before service could be restored. Belcher said Marcus 
was considering alternative programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus cut payments to Fox to bring them in line with what  
Charter Communications, one of the nation's biggest cable 
operators, pays for Fox Sports West programming in other 
communities, Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cable companies were accusing Fox of playing hardball  
regarding the surcharges, which affect Dodgers games after July 6 
and Angels after Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has rejected the idea of giving viewers who want the games a  
chance to pay for them directly, instead of making all customers 
bear the cost, said Media One spokeswoman Gisselle Acevedo-Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Wladika characterized the charges as ``nothing new,''  
Fox's tactic of taking the matter public -- with on-screen urgings 
to viewers to call their cable companies to make sure they have the 
games -- was questionable, Acevedo-Franco added.

<HEADLINE> Texans Go Wild For Spurs, Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With two Texas teams making it to their league championship  
series, Lone Star pride is in high gear this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey fans and basketball devotees across the state are  
rallying around the Dallas Stars and San Antonio Spurs. It's a rare 
opportunity for everyone, including those from cities without their 
own teams, to get on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	One ebullient Dallas radio talk show host said Monday, ``A Texas  
takeover -- bring that on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merchandisers are adding staff, beefing up stock and doing what  
they can to get hockey and basketball team gear to thousands of 
souvenir-hungry fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've more than doubled the stock, and even that's not  
sufficient'' said Terrence Brown of Aramark, a company licensed to 
the Spurs to sell official team products. ``We've had to have 
everything expressed in (by shipping companies).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the demand for merchandise specially made for the  
Western Conference champs has pushed sales about 40 percent higher 
for this time of year. Aramark has two stores -- one inside the 
Alamodome and the other within walking distance of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	At the StarStuff store in the Dallas area, located at the Dr  
Pepper Stars Center in suburban Irving, sales are running 300 
percent above previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Moore, the Dallas Stars' retail manager, told The Dallas  
Morning News: ``It's just nonstop. The frightening thing is this is 
nothing like what it will be if we win the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sports franchises sell traditional team-branded sports  
goods, like tee shirts, posters, jackets, caps and game jerseys. 
But the stores are also seeing a rush on newly minted souvenirs 
like miniature Stars goalie masks, matchbox-sized Zambonies, Spurs 
beer steins and silver and black Spurs car flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he's even considered stocking actual boot spurs, made  
of heavy metal with a Spurs logo branded on the cowboy gizmo's boot 
latch. 
</P>
<P>
	For their own part, San Antonio officials are expecting the  
benefits of a Spurs championship bid to bring in even more cash and 
more exposure that the city saw when it played host to the NCAA 
Final Four two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were excited to be going to the dance,'' said Carmen  
Vazquez-Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the city manager's office. 
``The first two finals games are sold out, and this means (the 
city) gets much more international coverage -- it's the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Solis, of the San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau,  
said a Spurs championship could turn out to be the biggest event 
the city has played host to. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dallas, a town raised on football and quickly earning its  
keep in baseball and hockey fan loyalty, the Stanley Cup finals 
games on Tuesday and tonight have some talking about even grander 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could put us in the running to host the 2012 Olympics,''  
said Bob Melton, a former Fort Worth-area state representative and 
now executive director for the Dallas All Sports Association, a 
nonprofit board that hands out scholarships and makes an annual 
award to national sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question the sports fan base is incredibly dynamic  
here -- the very rich spots culture is growing, growing, growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Helgeson, managing editor for IEG Sponsorship Report, a  
newsletter that tracks national trends in marketing, said the 
championship series could enable the Stars and Spurs to earn $1 
million to $2 million each from sponsors in future negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate benefit, Helgeson said, is that car dealerships,  
fast food chains and other local businesses will want to have their 
names appearing next to the Stars and Spurs logos. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the spillover effect,'' Helgeson said ``You're going to  
have more people want to buy more stuff to be part of the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 26 years of allegiance, Spurs fans have a reason to get  
excited about the possibility of a championship. Following the 
team's 4-0 sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, many 
camped out at the Alamodome to buy tickets for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Williams, a San Antonio sixth-grade teacher and Spurs fan  
since the team came to town in 1973, has bought tickets for games 
from time to time. He said he managed to get tickets for some games 
in each playoff round this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the bank is broke,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Fleming of Tyler said lots of people in his hometown 90  
miles east of Dallas have Stars fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming manages Sharky's, a sports bar in Tyler, and said so  
many people were coming for Tuesday night's televised start of the 
Stanley Cup finals that he canceled the usual open mike night. One 
party of about 20 to 30 people reserved tables, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're showing up to watch all the teams,'' said Laura  
Kanudsen, a bartender at Spectators Bar and Grill in Houston. ``As 
soon as the Rockets dropped out. they started pulling for the 
Spurs. And they're backing the Stars, too.''

<HEADLINE> Co. To Give $39M for Phone Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the nation's largest providers of  
telephone entertainment service has agreed to forgive $37 million 
and reimburse $2 million in charges to consumers who contested 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission, which announced the agreement  
Thursday, had accused American TelNet of ``cramming'' -- or putting 
unauthorized charges onto consumers' phone bills. The calls 
apparently were made, but by third parties who illegally gained 
access to the lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plantation, Fla., company, which did not admit wrongdoing,  
said it settled with the government to avoid lengthy and costly 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said American TelNet deprived consumers of their right  
to contest such charges and billed them even though the calls had 
not been made from their phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are frustrated when phantom charges for services  
they didn't authorize appear on their phone bills,'' said Jodie 
Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The 900-number calls were primarily for sex entertainment lines  
and some psychic hotlines as well, the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, one woman was attending a surgical  
preparation class an hour away from her home when the call to the 
entertainment line supposedly was made from her phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Another woman, a 74-year-old paraplegic who lives alone and has  
one wireless phone attached to her wheelchair, was billed for 
dialing the 900 number at a time when she did not have access to 
the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	One business was charged for a toll call allegedly made from a  
phone in the elevator of its building, even though the phone had no 
dial pad. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment telephone service can include adult-oriented talk  
lines, psychic hot lines and other 900 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case highlights the problems that both providers and  
consumers face from ``phreaking.'' The Internet is filled with 
sites instructing hackers on how they can gain access to someone's 
phone line, enabling them to make unauthorized long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the FTC complaint filed in U.S. District Court in  
Miami, American TelNet receives ``tens of thousands complaints from 
consumers every year as a result of its deceptive and sloppy 
marketing practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, when consumers called to contest the charges, they were  
told the matter would be investigated and a reply issued in a week, 
the FTC said. But the company simply generated a form letter saying 
the bill was accurate and should be paid, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, American TelNet will have to suspend  
billing while it investigated charges, and establish a way to 
determine whether charges were correctly tracked to consumers.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Wants To Cut Kosovo Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as members of both parties welcomed the  
Kosovo peace accord, the Republican-led House forged ahead today on 
legislation that would bar funds for peacekeeping operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they were incredulous at the timing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never in the history of this country has a Congress voted to  
deprive America of an American victory in the field after it has 
been achieved,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat 
on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans declined to back away from a provision in a  
defense spending bill that would bar funds for either a military or 
peacekeeping mission in the Balkans after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The president could spend money for such an operation only by  
citing national security concerns and sending separate legislation 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new and perhaps more troubling phase for our  
country,'' said the Armed Services Committee chairman, Rep. Floyd 
Spence, R-S.C. ``Administration policy has been contentious and 
confusing, not only for Congress but for the American people as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP provision has drawn a veto threat from the  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans are trying to strike that  
provision from a $288.8 billion defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., supports the restriction  
but praised the peace agreement and U.S. forces in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the people of Yugoslavia see this as an opportunity to  
replace their leadership, especially Mr. Milosevic,'' Hastert said 
in reference to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are opposing use of U.S. taxes in rebuilding  
Serbia, outside the province of Kosovo, as long as Milosevic 
remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton expressed his opposition to the provision in separate  
late-morning phone calls to both Hastert and Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton said the president told him he fully intends to send a  
request to Congress well before Sept. 30 to seek money for the 
peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said Clinton made a similar pledge in his  
conversation with Hastert -- and he also suggested it was premature 
to discuss the peacekeeping operation in any detail during the 
current debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, as the House resumed debate on the defense measure,  
Hastert told reporters, ``We are thrilled, very very happy, 
relieved that there is an agreement in Kosovo. ... I think we can 
all be very happy and prayerful that that's happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert added that the United States had already paid too  
much of the cost of the operation. When it comes to peacekeeping 
and rebuilding, he said he wants to make sure ``we aren't saddled 
with picking up the major part of the that burden as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted late Wednesday to end another U.S.  
peacekeeping force -- the one that has been in Haiti since March 
1995. The House voted 227-198 to pull the permanent force out of 
the Caribbean nation by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops have been fired on in Haiti. ... Things have gone  
sour in Haiti,'' said Sen. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee and the sponsor of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to leave our troops in Haiti in an open-ended  
deployment,'' agreed Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a permanent force, the measure would allow  
``periodic, noncontinuous'' troop deployments there. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents complained that the peacekeeping force in Haiti  
numbered fewer than 500 troops. ``Haiti does not have an army now 
because they agreed to get rid of it,'' said Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich. ``Our troops are not in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House also rejected, as it has done in past years, a  
proposal to liberalize the ban on abortions at military hospitals 
overseas. It turned back, 225-203, a proposal to allow the 
procedures if the woman paid for it with her own funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was also expected to take up a proposal by Rep. Tillie  
Fowler, R-Fla., that would require the president to get express 
prior approval from Congress before sending any forces to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted 428-0 for a package of amendments  
from members of a House committee that last month concluded China 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets over a 20-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	The package beefs up counterintelligence programs at the Energy  
Department, requires polygraph tests of employees at national 
laboratories, restricts lab visits by foreigners and requires a 
barrage of new reports to Congress on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Adds 5 Events to Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers are adding seven  
events, mostly for women, that are expected to pay for themselves 
in the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States could win more Olympic medals with the  
addition of women's bobsled and men's skeleton, a head-first 
version of luge. 
</P>
<P>
	Both events have a ``very good'' chance of producing medals for  
American teams, said Cathy Priestner-Allinger, sports director for 
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Women would get their own skeleton competition under the games'  
expansion approved Thursday by the SLOC management committee, which 
also added cross country ski sprints and 1,500-meter short-track 
speed skating for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,500-meter races are expected to be big ticket-sellers,  
offsetting the added costs of the other new events. All will work 
off existing Olympic venues and can easily can be added to the 
games' schedule, Allinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee, which has final say over  
the type and number of Olympic events, is expected to ratify Salt 
Lake's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion would push the number of events to 79, 11 more  
than in the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano and almost evenly split by 
gender. 
</P>
<P>
	The new events were approved even as Salt Lake struggles to fill  
a $300 million revenue gap and trim a $1.45 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney said the events make the sports  
schedule more equitable for women and will pay for themselves on 
ticket sales. In fact, he says, the events could produce a $200,000 
net gain -- a ``budget-enhancing opportunity'' that outweighs the 
financial risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, the SLOC management committee:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Approved an $150 daily housing allowance for athletes who  
prefer to stay in one of a dozen residences in Park City and Heber 
City that are closer to skiing events instead of the Olympic 
Village at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Noted the 1,000-day countdown to the 2002 Paralympic Winter  
Games for disabled athletes with a cake and by sending a Paralympic 
flag to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Approved a contract with Wige-MIC of Germany for computer  
software that will provide instant competition results to 
scoreboards, broadcasters and a database. Terms of the contract, 
approved behind closed doors in an executive session, were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Approved, also in executive session, a fund for merit raises  
for SLOC employees. The size of the pay fund was not disclosed. 
Salary increases will be awarded next month after job evaluations. 
SLOC has about 230 employees.

<HEADLINE> Sony To Ship Music On Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sony Music Entertainment plans to make more  
than 4,000 albums from its catalogs available on demand by storing 
them on computers and sending them directly to stores via a 
high-speed computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday with the Carlsbad, Calif.-based  
Digital On-Demand means record stores can install kiosks where 
customers can select their albums, pay for them at the register and 
have their CD made while they wait, complete with liner notes and 
original artwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really gives the consumer access to product that wasn't  
there before,'' said Sony spokesman Danny Yarbrough. 
</P>
<P>
	The back-catalog access provided by Sony includes material that  
may not sell enough copies to merit store space, which previously 
would have forced customers to make a special order. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers would be able to receive the music in a variety of  
formats, including CD, DVD, and MiniDisc, or have it installed 
directly onto a digital music player. Sony will only offer 
full-length albums, and not singles, as the service first rolls 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Artwork and liner notes for the music printed out on a laser  
printer will also be available for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The service will be tested beginning Sept. 1 at select  
Transworld and Virgin Megastores in Los Angeles and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookstores are taking notice of new technology that will allow  
them to provide books on demand. Sprout Inc. of Atlanta will 
provide Borders Group Inc., which owns the second-largest bookstore 
chain, with books in digital form that it licenses from publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bookstores are considering the technology as well, seeing  
it as another way to broaden their appeal to readers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashal Hoda, 18, who was shopping through San Francisco's Virgin  
Megastore for a new CD by Detroit rap artists Insane Clown Posse, 
though having music on demand sounded like a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes waiting,'' Hoda said as she browsed through CDs.  
</P>
<P>
	She said she would probably use the service if it offered  
individual songs as well as full-length albums. 
</P>
<P>
	While the fast and easy digital access may be music to the ears  
of consumers, some industry analysts cautioned that Sony must 
overcome a few obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	Forrester Research analyst Mark Hardie said the diminished laser  
printer quality of photos and art that accompany the music may work 
against an increasingly visual consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teen girls are not going to buy generic packages around an  
artist whose image is everything,'' Hardie said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also predicted that digital access would eventually fail  
unless artists from all labels could be marketed through one 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want artists, not labels,'' Hardie said.  
</P>
<P>
	The stores will get the equipment to manufacture the CDs free of  
charge, paying only a fee to the partnered companies on a 
per-download basis.

<HEADLINE> Digging Up Rock Stars' Pasts on VH1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If rock stars lived the quiet life, if they made  
it to bed each night by 10, there would be no ``Behind the Music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thankfully for VH1, that's not in the job description.  
</P>
<P>
	Rock stars stay out all night, and do drugs you've never even  
heard of. They make millions of dollars and lose it just as fast. 
They sleep with models, or anyone else who happens by. They hurl 
television sets from hotel windows. They get their blood transfused 
to get rid of all the chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	When it's all over, when they've lost their talent, their hair  
and most of their audience, they're vain enough to think the world 
still wants them on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, rock stars lead lives that invite voyeurism -- usually  
accompanied by a good soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give a 20-year-old kid $10 million, adoring fans and a  
life on the road -- that equals controversy and a great story,'' VH1 
President John Sykes said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the music biography has quickly become the cable  
music channel's signature series, and now something of a business 
in itself. VH1 recently scheduled ``Behind the Music'' for every 
night at 9 p.m., quietly began selling episodes on videotape, and 
is talking with record companies about releasing discs of artists 
featured on the shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people inclined to watch VH1 have at some point in their  
lives played air guitar to their favorite songs, or styled their 
hair for how it might appear on an album cover. 
</P>
<P>
	So it reassures these viewers to learn that the people who lived  
out their dream didn't always find it so wonderful, said Jeff 
Gaspin, the VH1 executive who masterminded the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, `my life isn't so terrible. My life isn't so bad,'''  
Gaspin said. ``I think there's some comfort in knowing that these 
lives are so miserable. And you're watching it from the comfort of 
your house. You're not driving in their car with them when they're 
drunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaspin used to work at ``Dateline NBC'' and that background is  
clearly evident on ``Behind the Music.'' The show is slick, the 
stories skirt the line of sleazy melodrama. And it's next to 
impossible to change channels. 
</P>
<P>
	Before you know it, you've watched an hour about Tony Orlando,  
even if you haven't thought about him for 20 years and didn't plan 
to for 20 more. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the music business' most embarrassing stories launched  
the series. Gaspin wondered what had happened to the two men of 
Milli Vanilli, the pre-fab pop band forced to give back the 1989 
Grammy Award for best new artist when it was revealed they were 
lip-synchers who didn't even perform on their album. He thought it 
would be a great human story, and the disgraced duo were only too 
willing to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	So was MC Hammer -- happy to explain how his $30 million fortune  
disappeared (mostly on luxurious cars and homes). The five 
best-known members of Fleetwood Mac laid out their story of sex, 
drugs and rock 'n' roll in excruciating detail. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflated self-image is another prerequisite. Rock stars  
aren't usually shy about talking of their lives, even the 
embarrassing parts. VH1 doesn't do unauthorized ``Behind the 
Music'' episodes. The artists must agree to tell all, and allow use 
of their music. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cassidy talked about how he worked and played too hard to  
enjoy any of his time as a teen idol. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a closure for a lot of them,'' Gaspin said. ``For a  
lot of these artists, it's the first time they've talked about some 
of these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vanilla Ice didn't want to talk. His ``Ice Ice Baby'' was a big  
hit, then even more quickly a subject for derision. He fell into a 
depression, did too many drugs, even tried to commit suicide. Why 
air all that dirty laundry? 
</P>
<P>
	But his new career as a punk rocker needed a publicity boost, so  
he agreed to film a ``Behind the Music.'' A strange thing happened: 
people began laughing with him, not at him, and the empty clubs 
where he used to perform suddenly filled up. Other has-beens had 
similar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of joking about it, they're now embracing it,'' he  
said. ``I feel like I'm getting a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now artists beg to come on the show, and Gaspin sometimes has to  
politely explain that their lives aren't interesting enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Which brings us to the biggest danger of the series. ``Behind  
the Music'' has a formula familiar to anyone who has seen the 
classic rock-group parody ``This is Spinal Tap.'' Many stories 
trace the same arc: the meteoric rise, the seat on top of the world 
and the inevitable fall -- the more gruesome, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Blondie -- who fit the formula perfectly -- joked in a  
recent interview about how Bruce Springsteen would make a poor 
subject because he never sank into depravity. 
</P>
<P>
	VH1 insists the stories have been broadened and can't be so  
easily typecast. So far, viewers are with them. That's good news 
for the network, since it has so much riding on the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaspin is confident that ``Behind the Music'' won't become a  
cliche. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that that's a potential risk,'' he said.  
``But I think you live with these risks every day and until it 
happens, you shouldn't worry about it. To change it now would be 
silly. And I wouldn't know what to change it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	GET TO THE POINT: CNN Headline News is revamping its on-air look  
and starting a marketing campaign to reach more viewers. The 
service, which delivers news headlines in a 30-minute cycle, will 
run ads bragging about its ``Get-to-the-point News.'' It will try 
to cram more information into each cycle and will have new on-air 
looks to distinguish itself during four different times of day. 
Executives also promise no repeats of news packages during each of 
the four sections of the day.

	WARNER ROBINS, Ga. (AP) -- For the Carrazco family, a trip to the  
doctor's office is a luxury they can't afford. So, like the 
families of many migrant workers, the doctor comes to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we don't make enough money'' to cover medical care,  
said Daniel Carrazco, 38, who gets up at 4 a.m. to pick peaches in 
nearby Crawford County and reports to a second job, in a plant that 
makes septic tanks, at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	On one evening last week, Carrazco sat under a canopy at the  
roving Migrant Health Fair as a nurse pricked his finger to check 
glucose and hemoglobin levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrazco, a Mexican-born father of three, was among about 120  
farm workers and relatives at Warner Robins' First Hispanic Baptist 
Mission. Most of the workers were single men who had only recently 
arrived from Mexico. A few, like Carrazco, brought wives and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	With volunteer medical specialists, including doctors and  
dentists, the mission has been providing free health care for 10 
years, primarily for the migrant workers who flock to mid-central 
Georgia to harvest the peach crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrazco brought his wife, Manuela, and their three children:  
Laura, 14; Adriana, 12; and Daniel Jr., 8. Carrazco has been 
working in the peach orchards since 1981 and brought his family to 
Georgia in 1992. He's now a citizen and the others are legal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura, the family spokeswoman, said the health fair is  
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people come from places in Mexico where they don't have  
doctors,'' she said. ``And sometimes they don't go to doctors here 
because they're afraid of immigration. They're afraid they'll be 
sent back to Mexico. They need to work. They need the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 20-week harvest season, the ministry reaches those in  
need by bringing the health fair to farms throughout peach country. 
The Georgia Baptist Convention provides an air-conditioned, 48-foot 
trailer that has an examination room, sterilizers and two dental 
chairs with X-ray machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do almost everything in here,'' said Dr. Steve Wilson,  
a local family practitioner. ``We can stitch up cuts. We fill 
cavities, pull teeth that need to be pulled and put sealant on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they discover any life-threatening conditions, the doctors  
can arrange emergency treatment at local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	That evening last week the workers arrived in vans or pickup  
trucks. After registering, they moved from one station to the next 
for blood and blood pressure testing, dental screening, eye tests 
and several other checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the tests were conducted outside under one of three  
large canopies, and others were performed in the air-conditioned 
comfort of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	A pharmacy provided prescription and nonprescription drugs for  
ailments ranging from skin rashes to arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	The last stop was the dining room, where volunteers served chili  
and soft drinks. They gave each person a health kit containing 
personal hygiene essentials, such as shampoo and toothbrushes. Then 
the workers attended a briefing on health hazards, including 
smoking and chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission, supported by the 54 Southern Baptist Convention  
churches that make up the Rehoboth Baptist Association, also offers 
English classes, used clothing and religious training for migrants.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Jump by 14,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits shot up last week to the highest level since 
early January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that 323,000 Americans filed  
new claims for jobless benefits last week, up by 14,000 from the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was unexpected. Analysts had expected the number of  
claims for unemployment benefits to inch down slightly. Government 
analysts noted that the reporting period included the Memorial Day 
holiday. Weeks including a holiday have often been erratic in terms 
of the number of people showing up in benefit claims offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jumps in claims last week pushed them to the highest  
level since the week of Jan. 9, when they were at 358,000. After 
that increase jobless claims declined for nearly two months. They 
remained below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, the longest stretch 
in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which helps  
smooth out week-to-week volatility, also was up slightly to 
308,250. That was the highest level since May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase in jobless claims, the number of  
Americans putting in for unemployment benefits is still low and 
depicts a tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the government reported that the nation's unemployment  
rate edged down to 4.2 percent, returning to a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, manufacturing has lost more than 453,000 jobs in the past  
14 months due to the global financial crisis, which has cut into 
exports and increased cheap imports into this country. But the rest 
of the U.S. economy, powered by strong consumer spending, is 
continuing to show robust growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that for the week ending May 29, 18  
states and territories reported declined in jobless claims while 35 
had increases. The state data lags a week heind the national 
figures 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina had the biggest declines in benefit applications,  
a drop of 1,210, which was attributed to fewer layoffs in the 
electrical equipment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with big drops in benefit claims were: California,  
down 815; Orgeon, down 723; Georgia, down 390; and Tennessee, down 
205. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the largest increase in jobless claims was  
Michigan, with a jump of 1,938 applications, an increase that was 
blamed on layoffs in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with big increases in benefit claims were: Texas,  
up 1,676; Mississippi, up 1,328; Arizona, up 1,203; and Missouri, 
up 1,046. The increase in Texas was blamed on layoffs in the 
apparel and trade industries, while the increase in Mississippi 
because of layoffs at apparel and electrical equipment factories.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Boldon Win 200s in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Marion Jones won the women's 200 meters  
in 21.91 seconds, crushing the field in a Grand Prix track meet at 
Olympic Stadium Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ato Boldon of Trinidad had to fight to the finish to beat  
Obadele Thompson of Barbados in the men's 200, both clocking 20.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the world's top-ranked female sprinter, was only .1  
second off her seasonal best of 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very tired before the race because the third day in  
Europe is the hardest,'' Jones said. ``Principally I ran early in 
the morning, so I can be happy for my time. This was a good start 
to the European tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia set out to beat the 3,000-meter  
world record, but finished in 7:26.03, well off Kenyan Daniel 
Komen's mark of 7:20.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan Kreijkamp of the Netherlands set the pace for 900 meters  
and Vincent Malakwen of Kenya went past the first 1,000 in 2:25, 
1.7 seconds faster than the ideal pace. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and Branko Zorko of Croatia could not carry Gebrselassie  
another 500 meters before the pace slackened. At 1,600 meters, 
Gebrselassie was more than two seconds off the record pace and not 
able to make it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized early I had to fight alone against the clock in  
order to break the record,'' he said. ``I tried my best until the 
end because I never give up. Maybe the wind was a bit too much for 
me, but I am very happy, it is never easy to run a sub-7.30.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also failed to beat his personal best of 7:25.09.  
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Makarov of Russia beat a strong men's javelin field,  
throwing 281 feet, 3 inches. Boris Henry of Germany, Aki Parviainen 
and Matti Narhi of Finland, and Britain's Steve Backley all were 
within 16 inches of Makarov. Henry was second at 280-4. 
</P>
<P>
	C.J. Hunter won the shot put at 68-3 1/4, while American teammate  
Larry Wade, the year's fastest 110 hurdler (13.12) lost to Robin 
Korving of the Netherlands. Korving won in 13.21, .02 seconds ahead 
of Wade.

<HEADLINE> Sauter Wins Pole for Truck Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Jay Sauter, who's struggled with  
qualifying throughout a 70-race NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series 
career, recorded the fastest single lap in the tour's history 
Thursday night to win the pole position for the Pronto Auto Parts 
400 race at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter, driving a Chevrolet Silverado, lapped the 1.5-mile  
superspeedway at 179.718 mph, the fastest of four drivers who 
shattered Jack Sprague's year-old qualifying record of 178.642. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter's pole run was the first for Richard Childress Racing,  
the tour's pole leader, since Oct. 5, 1995. The team's former 
driver, current NASCAR Winston Cup star Mike Skinner, got his 15th 
and final pole at Sears Point Raceway near Sonoma, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested real good here in the spring and these guys put an  
awesome truck under me today,'' the 36-year-old Wisconsin veteran 
said. ``It was a good run. I've loved this race track from the 
first time I came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter, ranked 10th in the driver standings, last won at  
Martinsville, Va. last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Sauter on the front row will be Stacy Compton. The Dodge  
driver narrowly missed his third pole of the season, recording a 
lap of 179.390. Dennis Setzer was third at 178.761 in another 
Dodge, followed by Ron Hornaday's Silverado, which also broke 
Sprague's Texas Motor Speedway mark at 178.660. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Bliss, the second driver to qualify, held onto the No. 5  
spot with a lap of 178.218. Bliss held the provisional pole until 
Hornaday made his run. Sauter took the pole late in the order, 
after a 15-minute delay for track cleanup following Eric Norris' 
accident in Turn 2. The television stunt coordinator's Ford was 
severely damaged but the son of TV and film actor Chuck Norris 
escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague, Terry Fisher, Bryan Reffner, Andy Houston and David  
Starr rounded out the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornaday enters Friday's event with a 37-point lead over  
Compton, who has finished in the top four in eight of nine races 
this season.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Chief Rides High on a Hog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When AT&AMP;T chief executive C. Michael Armstrong  
takes his wife for a spin on his motorcycle, she holds on tight and 
says, ``Don't tilt it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees and shareholders can sympathize.  
</P>
<P>
	Sure, they're trusting, even thrilled, to be barreling down a  
new path with Armstrong -- confident in his plan to snap up cable TV 
wires around the country so AT&AMP;T can offer a cutting-edge 
combination of television, telephone and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, when someone else is steering, it's hard not to  
wince at every bend in the road. In this case however, the biker in 
question doesn't seem bent on reckless living or daredevil stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearly four-decade career with just three companies; a  
long-lasting marriage to the sweetheart he met at age 14 -- these 
are not the traits of a free-wheeling cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it's a more sober sort of risk-taker that AT&AMP;T hired to  
reinvent a lethargic phone company -- to reprise his turnaround 
earlier this decade of the defense contractor Hughes Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	While he's never had a motorcycle accident, Armstrong said in a  
recent interview, ``We've all had `situations.' When you ride a 
motorcycle, it's very difficult to ride it with any regularity and 
not have been confronted with some dangerous situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professionally, some would say his worst ``situation'' came in  
the 1980s, at the tail-end of his three-decade-plus career at IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong joined IBM in 1961 and by the mid '80s had worked his  
way into senior management. It was his team that squandered the 
company's leadership in the personal computer revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Although IBM's PC started out as the industry standard, its PC  
division was tied to the company's sluggish bureaucracy. It failed 
to innovate and was eventually overtaken by faster-moving 
competitors such as Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
	That brush with failure didn't make Armstrong a squeamish driver  
when he moved on to Hughes in 1992, and AT&AMP;T five years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was the first outsider ever hired to run Hughes and  
the first import to lead AT&AMP;T in eight decades, he didn't hesitate 
to cut thousands of jobs as a prelude to a full makeover at both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hughes, he steered the company away from its core military  
electronics business, ultimately selling it to Raytheon, to go full 
bore into the commercial satellite businesses -- including DirecTV, 
the TV service that uses small satellite dishes instead of cables. 
</P>
<P>
	The transition at AT&AMP;T has been even more radical. It's not a  
sheepish man who decides, in the space of just 10 months, to spend 
more than $100 billion of his new employer's money on an uncertain 
strategy in an entirely different industry. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, Armstrong goal in purchasing the big cable TV  
companies Tele-Communications Inc. and MediaOne Group is a lot more 
ambitious than just transforming the No. 1 long-distance phone 
company into the No. 1 cable company. 
</P>
<P>
	His strategy is to transform the cable industry into something  
new by upgrading the coaxial cables bringing TV to America's homes 
into a ``broadband'' pipe for two-way, high-speed communications. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pace he's set for AT&AMP;T has been breathless, none of  
the past year's moves could be accurately described as a shot from 
the hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 60, strikes a confident, charismatic chord in public  
-- aided by an imposing six-foot frame, a twinkle in the eyes and 
the type of snow-white hair and male-pattern baldness that makes 
him look more distinguished than old. 
</P>
<P>
	But in person, Armstrong can be soft-spoken, almost  
grandfatherly. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Detroit at the tail-end of the Depression, Charles  
Michael Armstrong was the oldest of three boys. His future wife, 
Anne, lived 16 houses down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started going together -- they called it `going steady' in  
those days -- when we were 14 years old,'' Armstrong said. They 
dated through high school, went to the same college in Oxford, 
Ohio, and married soon after. 
</P>
<P>
	``So our lives have been, from the very beginning, common  
lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Common, except that his career has now forced them to move 16  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's gotten (the moving) down pretty well,'' said Armstrong,  
who had just bought a home near Hughes' headquarters in Southern 
California, when he was asked to lead AT&AMP;T. ``My wife had 
completely redecorated it, and we moved in and lived in it seven 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who has three daughters with seven grandchildren,  
only recently moved into his newest home after living for more than 
a year in a hotel near AT&AMP;T's offices in suburban New Jersey so he 
could immerse himself in the new job at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived at AT&AMP;T late 1997, there were meetings, meetings  
and more meetings. The get-to-know-you sessions he convened back 
then took nearly three months to adjourn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were days when we started a meeting that was supposed to  
go half a day on Monday morning, and on Thursday we were still 
going at it. Calendars got blown away,'' said Richard Roscitt, 
president of AT&AMP;T Solutions, which manages communications networks 
for other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a better listener than I would have guessed,'' said  
Roscitt, a 26-year veteran at AT&AMP;T. ``He has an enormous ability 
to, as he likes to call it, drill down to the details, and retain 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the much same deal when he arrived at Hughes in 1992,  
when ``Mike spent the first six months getting educated,'' said 
Richard Dore, a Hughes spokesman who worked with Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	At meetings, Dore said, he would grow impatient ``if you started  
straying too much. Sometimes people make presentations and there's 
a lot of fluff, and fluff takes too much time. He wants to cut to 
the chase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Armstrong's aggressive moves at AT&AMP;T have  
energized the company's troops by guaranteeing a role for a 
century-old company on a field dominated by youngsters like America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	In so doing, Armstrong has emerged as one of the nation's most  
prominent executives, a nimble power-broker on par with Microsoft's 
Bill Gates and News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch, and far more 
well-regarded at that.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MCAFEE, N.J. (AP) -- Dressed in bright red team jackets or in  
three-piece suits, the advisers, technical directors and translator 
for the North Korea women's soccer team could have been at a trial. 
They answered questions readily, but without revealing anything 
noteworthy. They seemed anxious to finish with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	In the background, the 20 players chatted as they took off their  
warmups and prepared for a workout at the Ballyowen Field, hard by 
the first hole of the year-old Ballyowen golf course. Then they 
stretched, jogged a lap -- and headed straight through the 
sprinklers watering the grass. Their giggles and shenanigans while 
trying to see who could force the other to get most wet drew smiles 
from reporters, if not from Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is any pressure on the players of the most mysterious  
team in the Women's World Cup, it's difficult to sense. They seem 
to be having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that they will admit it when asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been here six days, and our prime task is to qualify  
for the Olympics in Sydney,'' said captain Kim Kum Sil, the lone 
player made available for interviews Thursday at the only media 
session team officials planned to allow. North Korea must make the 
quarterfinals to have a shot at the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things have changed, such as the time change. We are  
having jet lag and we still are not accustomed to the climate 
change,'' she said. ``We are trying to get accustomed to them and 
the things we can concentrate on as soon possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That shouldn't be very difficult, considering the way they are  
being sheltered. Then again, for a nation whose athletes rarely 
travel outside of Asia, that's an understandable approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not distract the players,'' said Ryu Song Il,  
secretary-general of the North Korean Olympic Committee, when asked 
if the players would be mingling with Korean-Americans during the 
tournament. ``Doing any kind of activities that might affect 
players while they are conditioning and training is not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans head for Los Angeles this weekend, where they will  
practice leading up to their tournament opener against Nigeria on 
June 20. They play Denmark in Portland, Ore., on June 24, then face 
the host Americans on June 27 in Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Although little is known about them, they have limited  
experience on the world stage and have not been a soccer power in 
previous years, the Koreans remain confident they can advance to 
the second round, if not further. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time our country is attempting the Women's  
World Cup,'' technical director Kim Hak-Yong said. ``Women's soccer 
was not started long ago in my country, but it has gained a strong 
reputation so far. I think my team will play as a good, strong team 
this time. How we play against strong teams will demonstrate how 
we've prepared for this World Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Sonics' Employee Award Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated $5.2  
million in damages Thursday to six former ticket-sellers for the 
Seattle SuperSonics who were fired after protesting the loss of 
their overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled that employees can't be fired for complaining to  
their employers about wage violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket-sellers said they were fired for protesting to the  
basketball team's management about elimination of their overtime. A 
federal judge later ruled the overtime cutoff illegal and the 
workers were awarded damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the award was thrown out last October by a  
three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 
panel said employees couldn't sue for retaliation under federal 
labor law because they had complained only to their supervisors and 
did not file a formal complaint with the government before suing. 
</P>
<P>
	After the full court ordered a rehearing, a new panel ruled 9-2  
Thursday that the law applied to complaints made to employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was intended to ``ensure that employees are not  
compelled to risk their jobs in order to assert their wage and hour 
rights,'' said the opinion by Judge Stephen Reinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of seven other appellate courts have reached the same  
conclusion, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the former ticket-sellers said the ruling should  
benefit employers as well as employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think employers have any interest in their employees'  
being forced to go to court before trying to work things out,'' 
Spencer Hall said. ``It would encourage litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Full House Sports and Entertainment, the Sonics' managing  
company, said it would appeal to the Supreme Court. ``Our legal 
counsel has advised us that we have strong grounds for appeal,'' 
company president John Dressel said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case dates from mid-1994, when the Sonics eliminated the  
$2,000 annual overtime allowances paid to ticket-sellers and 
stopped paying them overtime. An employee who complained said she 
was told by a team official that William Ackerley, the chief 
operating officer, didn't care about the law and wouldn't pay 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The team eventually paid them for lost overtime. But nine  
ticket-sellers were fired in December 1994 after Full House Sports 
took over the team's business management. The court said the only 
seller who kept his job was the one who hadn't complained. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District court jury awarded the six $697,000 in back pay  
and $450,000 for emotional distress. Jurors also awarded $12 
million in punitive damages, an amount the judge reduced to $4.18 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel's ruling last October would have  
eliminated the punitive damages and reduced the emotional distress 
award. The opinion by Judge Melvin Brunetti said the distress 
damages, $75,000 per employee, were ``grossly excessive'' because 
evidence showed their suffering was ``not that severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's ruling disagreed with Brunetti and upheld the entire  
damage award. Judges Pamela Rymer and Ferdinand Fernandez 
dissented.

<HEADLINE> Bob Knight Investigated in Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight is  
being investigated for assaulting a fellow patron at a restaurant, 
Monroe County Prosecutor Carl Salzmann said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed, but Knight may face a misdemeanor  
charge of battery, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in 
jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said the 38-year-old man who claims he was assaulted  
also could be charged with provocation, a Class C infraction that 
carries a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you provoke somebody to commit battery, and a battery  
occurs -- do you charge both people?'' Salzmann asked. ``That's what 
we're trying to figure out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said he had a preliminary report from Indiana State  
Police on the incident, but wanted more information before deciding 
whether to charge either or both men. 
</P>
<P>
	The altercation occurred about 9:30 p.m. Monday at a Mexican  
restaurant in Ellettsville, about five miles from Bloomington, 
Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight had been dining with his wife and her two sisters when  
the other man, who was dining with a friend, took offense to 
comments he overheard Knight making. The man confronted Knight as 
he was preparing to leave, claiming the comments he had overheard 
were racist, Salzmann said. The other man was white. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight paid his bill and walked to the parking lot, where the  
altercation continued and the man claims Knight grabbed him around 
the throat and lifted him into the air, Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other man then returned to the restaurant and called police.  
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said the man later sought medical treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	A state trooper, along with an Ellettsville police officer,  
responded and took pictures of injuries the man said he had 
suffered, Salzmann said. They also questioned the man, his friend, 
Knight's wife, one of her sisters and the restaurant manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said he still wants state police to talk to several  
unbiased witnesses, including other restaurant workers and patrons.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad Says Vegas Not Neutral Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Felix Trinidad wants more influence  
in the selection of judges for the welterweight unification fight 
against Oscar De La Hoya in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad and his managers also said they want to set aside 3,000  
of the 12,000 tickets for the Sept. 18 championship fight so fellow 
Puerto Ricans can help eliminate any hometown advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my people there,'' the International Boxing Federation  
champion said during a news conference Thursday. ``Every country 
wants to be able to support its champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad's handlers say they are concerned because Bob Arum, De  
La Hoya's promoter, is based in Las Vegas and De La Hoya is from 
nearby southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight at the Mandalay Bay Hotel must be ``absolutely fair,''  
said Trinidad's manager and father, Felix Trinidad Sr., because it 
will be the biggest match since a disputed March 13 bout between 
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxing fans disgusted by accusations of misconduct by judges in  
the Holyfield-Lewis fight won't pay the $49 pay-per-view fee if 
there are doubts about the fairness, Trinidad Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Nevada Athletic Commission chairman Elias Ghanem  
has invited both fighters to review lists of possible judges and 
referees and offer suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to know that the fight will be fair and that  
Trinidad will have input into selection of the officials,'' he said 
during a conference call Thursday. ``The fight will go on without 
mistakes and without any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya last fought in Las Vegas on May 22, stopping Oba Carr  
in the 11th round. The city will likely be the site for a 
Holyfield-Lewis rematch in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will probably choose one judge from the World  
Boxing Council and one from the International Boxing Federation, 
with a third judge from Nevada, Ghanem said. De La Hoya holds the 
WBC belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure the judges that they won't have to do much work,  
since I'm going to win by a knockout,'' Trinidad said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has agreed to fight for a $10.5 million purse -- of which $2  
million will go to promoter Don King -- in addition to $4 for every 
pay-per-view customer over 800,000. De La Hoya will get at least 
$15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, who easily stopped Colombian Hugo Pineda before a  
hometown crowd in San Juan on May 29, wants a substantial 
delegation of fans to counter his image as the lesser-known 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Puerto Ricans to witness De La Hoya's death,''  
Trinidad Sr. joked during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum, however, controls sales of most of the tickets through his  
Top Rank Boxing. A Top Rank spokesman could not immediately be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's Secretary of Sports and Recreation, Eric Labrador,  
said he will write letters to Arum and Nevada boxing officials 
urging that some tickets be set aside when sales begin Wednesday. 
Ticket prices will range from $300 to $1,500, according to Top 
Rank. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is undefeated in 35 fights with 30 knockouts and has  
long sought a fight with De La Hoya, considered the world's top 
welterweight with a 31-0 record and 22 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters begin a tour of American cities next week to  
publicize the bout.

<HEADLINE> Mitsbushi Cars Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Nearly half a million cars built by  
Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America Inc. are being recalled 
for a potential steering problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars affected by the recall include Mitsubishi Galants from the  
1994 to 1996 model years; Mitsubishi Eclipses from 1995 and 1996; 
Eclipse Spyders from 1996; and Eagle Talons, Dodge Avengers, and 
Chrysler Sebrings from the 1995 and 1996 model years. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of cars being recalled is 464,000, but  
Mitsubishi officials believe few are actually affected by the 
problem. Owners should take their cars to dealers for a free 
inspection and part replacement if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	A rubber boot on an arm of the wheel mechanism can become  
damaged, exposing a ball joint to dirt and water. That could cause 
extensive wear and in the worst case, a wheel could collapse, 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesman Tim Hurd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi officials said in a statement that they are unaware  
of any reports of injury caused by the condition.

	Bombing of Yugoslavia Is Suspended  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Serb troops began withdrawing from Kosovo,  
President Clinton today warned Slobodan Milosevic that NATO's 
78-day bombing campaign is suspended but not formally terminated. 
``We now have a moment of hope,'' the president said. ``We have to 
finish the job and build a peace.'' The president then spoke by 
telephone with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, praising his 
leadership and the diplomatic role played by former Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. Clinton said American forces ``performed 
superbly, risking their lives,'' and called the Serbs' apparent 
capitulation a vindication of U.S. efforts.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council is meeting this hour

Kosovo to ensure the safe return of 860,000 ethnic Albanian 
refugees. The meeting follows an announcement from NATO suspending 
its airstrikes against Yugoslavia after verifying the withdrawal of 
Serb forces was underway. The draft resolution also calls on the 
United Nations to start rebuilding the province and create a 
civilian administration that would lay the groundwork for a future 
autonomous government.

	Court Strikes Down 'Street Gang' Law

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today struck down a Chicago  
law aimed at preventing street gang members and their friends from 
hanging out in public. The 6-3 decision ended a constitutional 
dispute that captured the attention of states and communities 
across the nation. The court said the 1992 anti-loitering ordinance 
violated the rights of the people police arrested because it did 
not give them adequate notice what was forbidden. In striking down 
the ordinance as too vague, today's decision acknowledged ``the 
serious and difficult problems'' street gangs cause for Chicago.

forcing the once-vaunted political powerhouse to split into two 
entities and be ``dramatically reshaped,'' officials close to the 
group said today. The IRS first denied tax-exempt status to the 
group last year and the Christian Coalition was notified in recent 
weeks that it would lose the appeal, according to the officials. A 
spokesman for the organization said the new entity could form a 
political action committee, and will open chapters overseas.

Voicing concern, the Group of Eight leading industrial nations and 
Russia urged both countries today to sign the international treaty 
banning nuclear testing. India says the militants crossed the 
unmarked cease-fire line from Pakistan last month and control about 
40 square miles in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir. Pakistan

<HEADLINE> FEC Allows Matching Internet Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government today gave a major boost to  
political fund raising in cyberspace, ruling that presidential 
candidates can qualify for federal campaign assistance for 
donations they raise over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission, which oversees campaign laws,  
voted 6-0 to allow presidential candidates who take credit card 
donations on their Web sites to qualify for federal matching 
dollars during the primary elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al  
Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination, had asked the FEC 
earlier this spring to qualify his Internet donations for the 
federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will have a sweeping effect for the major  
presidential candidates, all of whom have Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize the reality that the Internet is here and a big  
part of our life,'' FEC Chairman Scott Thomas said after the vote. 
``We need to let it be used freely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since federal campaign laws were overhauled in the aftermath of  
Watergate, taxpayers have provided assistance to presidential 
candidates who agree to spending limits during the primary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The government provides dollar-for-dollar matching for the first  
$250 of each individual contribution that a qualified candidate 
receives during the primary elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But that law never addressed the possibility that candidates  
would one day raise money over the Internet, where the easiest way 
to make a donation is via credit card. The existing FEC regulation 
had in fact forbidden candidates from collecting federal matching 
funds on such donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC voted to allow presidential campaigns to begin  
collecting credit card donations in anticipation of receiving 
matching funds for them next Jan. 1. That means credit card 
donations will be treated the same as those candidates receive in 
the mail or at fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is made up of six members split evenly along  
party lines. They signaled at a hearing last month their 
willingness to change the rules to open up fund raising in 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring disapproval from the Congress or the president, the new  
regulations would take effect in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC will require the campaigns to maintain security  
procedures -- the details of which are still to be worked out -- to 
avoid illegal donations via corporate credit cards or from 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Many commission members, however, had stressed that it would be  
unfair to place more restrictions on credit card donations than on 
more traditional forms like checks or money orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, FEC staff was concerned about the security matter and  
the possibility that donors could use the Internet to evade 
campaign laws. But supporters argued those concerns were overblown 
in an era when Americans make billions of dollars of purchases over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the early advocates of the changes was former FEC  
Chairman Trevor Potter, who argued that the Internet provided a 
``perfect mechanism for small donors'' to get involved in 
presidential campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Settles Ohio Radiation Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMISBURG, Ohio (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Energy has  
settled a lawsuit by nuclear weapons plant employees who say they 
were exposed to dangerous radiation but were not told about it for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The department agreed to pay lifetime health insurance coverage  
for as many as 1,800 current and former workers at the Mound 
nuclear plant in the Dayton suburbs. The deal, subject to approval 
by a federal judge, is expected to cost several million dollars, 
depending on insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal requires the Energy Department to provide lifetime  
insurance coverage to Mound workers who contract any of several 
types of cancer, including brain, nervous system, bladder, bone, 
lung, pancreatic, digestive and oral cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mound plant began operating in 1948 and made triggers and  
detonators for nuclear weapons. The Energy Department has halted 
those operations to focus on cleaning up waste at the site, which 
officials want to convert into an office park. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve employees and the Oil, Chemical &AMP; Atomic Workers union  
filed the lawsuit in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing. Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson said it is intended to address the 
workers' worries about what radiation exposure may have done to 
them.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Wants To Cut Kosovo Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as members of both parties welcomed the  
Kosovo peace accord, the Republican-led House forged ahead today on 
legislation that would bar funds for peacekeeping operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they were incredulous at the timing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never in the history of this country has a Congress voted to  
deprive America of an American victory in the field after it has 
been achieved,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat 
on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans declined to back away from a provision in a  
defense spending bill that would bar funds for either a military or 
peacekeeping mission in the Balkans after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The president could spend money for such an operation only by  
citing national security concerns and sending separate legislation 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new and perhaps more troubling phase for our  
country,'' said the Armed Services Committee chairman, Rep. Floyd 
Spence, R-S.C. ``Administration policy has been contentious and 
confusing, not only for Congress but for the American people as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP provision has drawn a veto threat from the  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans are trying to strike that  
provision from a $288.8 billion defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., supports the restriction  
but praised the peace agreement and U.S. forces in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the people of Yugoslavia see this as an opportunity to  
replace their leadership, especially Mr. Milosevic,'' Hastert said 
in reference to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are opposing use of U.S. taxes in rebuilding  
Serbia, outside the province of Kosovo, as long as Milosevic 
remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton expressed his opposition to the provision in separate  
late-morning phone calls to both Hastert and Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton said the president told him he fully intends to send a  
request to Congress well before Sept. 30 to seek money for the 
peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said Clinton made a similar pledge in his  
conversation with Hastert -- and he also suggested it was premature 
to discuss the peacekeeping operation in any detail during the 
current debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, as the House resumed debate on the defense measure,  
Hastert told reporters, ``We are thrilled, very very happy, 
relieved that there is an agreement in Kosovo. ... I think we can 
all be very happy and prayerful that that's happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert added that the United States had already paid too  
much of the cost of the operation. When it comes to peacekeeping 
and rebuilding, he said he wants to make sure ``we aren't saddled 
with picking up the major part of the that burden as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted late Wednesday to end another U.S.  
peacekeeping force -- the one that has been in Haiti since March 
1995. The House voted 227-198 to pull the permanent force out of 
the Caribbean nation by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops have been fired on in Haiti. ... Things have gone  
sour in Haiti,'' said Sen. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee and the sponsor of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to leave our troops in Haiti in an open-ended  
deployment,'' agreed Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a permanent force, the measure would allow  
``periodic, noncontinuous'' troop deployments there. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents complained that the peacekeeping force in Haiti  
numbered fewer than 500 troops. ``Haiti does not have an army now 
because they agreed to get rid of it,'' said Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich. ``Our troops are not in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House also rejected, as it has done in past years, a  
proposal to liberalize the ban on abortions at military hospitals 
overseas. It turned back, 225-203, a proposal to allow the 
procedures if the woman paid for it with her own funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was also expected to take up a proposal by Rep. Tillie  
Fowler, R-Fla., that would require the president to get express 
prior approval from Congress before sending any forces to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted 428-0 for a package of amendments  
from members of a House committee that last month concluded China 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets over a 20-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	The package beefs up counterintelligence programs at the Energy  
Department, requires polygraph tests of employees at national 
laboratories, restricts lab visits by foreigners and requires a 
barrage of new reports to Congress on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	------

	The bill is H.R. 1401

<HEADLINE> Stocks Extend Fall; Dow Off 141.53 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended their losses today as a strong  
economic report from Japan increased fears that continued growth in 
the U.S. economy may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it looks like interest rates are going up, stocks are going  
down,'' said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security 
Benefit Group in Topeka, Kan. ``It's that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 141.53 at 10,548.76 after falling 219 points over the previous 
two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 21.83 at 1,296.81, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was off 38.71 at 2,480.64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government said the nation's gross domestic product  
grew 1.9 percent in the first three months of the year -- a larger 
increase than expected, and the first since the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That set off fears that Japanese demand for U.S. goods will  
swell, boosting the domestic economy even further and setting off 
inflationary pressure. The threat of inflation has prompted the Fed 
to say it might raise interest rates if it determines that higher 
rates would cool off a surging economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, which are highly sensitive to inflation, fell  
today, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.04 
percent. Analysts consider bond yields above 6 percent to be 
detrimental to stocks, as investors may turn to the lucrative, 
stable return of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market has really set the leadership for the stock  
market today,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at 
BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks like Chase Manhattan, down 1 5/8 to 72 3/16, were  
mostly lower. Higher interest rates can hurt bank profits as 
lending volume shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks also fell today. Those shares, which tend to be  
expensive, also tend to flag in high interest-rate environments as 
investors become less willing to pay high prices relative to 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology companies are also battling customers' uncertainty  
over the Year 2000 computer bug, analysts said. Microsoft fell 2 
11/16 to 79 5/8 and Cisco Systems fell 3 1/2 to 110 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer fell sharply for a second straight day, losing 5 1/8 to 99  
13/16. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday restricted 
the use of Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders remain focused on the Friday morning release of the  
producer price index. That report is expected to offer the latest 
hint of whether inflationary pressures have crept into the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to establish that the U.S. economy is not boiling to  
the point of explosion,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 556.0 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 8.98 at 620.30, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.28 at 767.71.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Counsell Wants To Be Traded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Craig Counsell, a World Series hero two years ago,  
is upset about his shrinking role with the Florida Marlins and says 
he wants to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell didn't complain publicly when he lost his starting job  
at second base to Luis Castillo during spring training. But after 
being taken out of the second game of a doubleheader Tuesday 
against Baltimore in the eighth inning, Counsell voiced his 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can handle being a utility player, and I can handle losing  
my job in spring training,'' Counsell told reporters Wednesday. 
``But now they're telling me I can't play defense?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager John Boles sent Castillo into the game as a defensive  
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell, who scored the winning run in the 1997 World Series,  
has started just 10 of 60 games and has a .152 average in 66 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to accommodate him,'' general manager Dave  
Dombrowski said. ``But he has value. He could be an everyday second 
baseman for some big-league clubs. ... We're not going to give him 
away.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Militia Members Sentenced in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- A militia member accused of plotting to  
kill government officials and commit terrorist attacks in western 
Michigan was sentenced to 55 years in prison Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Graham, 42, had been convicted of conspiracy and of  
growing marijuana to bankroll the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said he and two other members of a group called the  
North American Militia plotted to assassinate Gov. John Engler, 
Sen. Carl Levin and federal judges. They also allegedly schemed to 
blow up the federal building in Battle Creek and the Internal 
Revenue Service building in Portage. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the alleged targets, U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen,  
sentenced Graham, who claimed he was guilty of nothing more than 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Enslen responded: ``This was not talk in a coffee shop. Randy  
Graham was a domestic terrorist, one trigger pull away from killing 
people and blowing up buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham got the stiffest sentence of the three militia members  
arrested in 1998 after a two-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford Metcalf, 48, was sentenced to 40 years in prison.  
Kenneth Carter, 48, who cooperated with the government, pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy and got five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Airlines OK Customer Service Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's major airlines today agreed to a  
plan for better treatment of their passengers, a voluntary move 
aimed at holding off more serious mandatory directives from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of the 12-point plan, a draft of which was obtained  
Wednesday by The Associated Press, would commit airlines to meeting 
customers' essential needs during long, on-aircraft delays. That 
would include making ``every reasonable effort to provide food, 
water, restroom facilities and access to medical treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That commitment stems from the New Year's travel delays in  
Detroit, when passengers stuck on snowbound plans were held for 
hours in view of the airport terminal, in some cases without access 
to food, water or functioning toilets. Complaints about such 
treatment prompted several bills in the House and Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One such bill would require airlines to pay passengers  
compensation when they are stranded for more than two hours. 
Another would give passengers 48 hours to cancel nonrefundable 
tickets. Northwest Airlines, the focus for many of the New Year's 
complaints, also was criticized last week by the Transportation 
Department for its handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the nation's major airlines were planning to  
announce the plan during a midday news conference in downtown 
Washington. They had been expected to announce it during a news 
conference with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, but that was postponed 
Wednesday when last-minute glitches arose. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the  
trade group representing the airlines, said: ``Clearly there has 
been an outcry on this issue. Certainly Congress has been at the 
forefront of it. And we've been talking with members about it and 
ways to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides better treatment of stranded passengers, the airline  
plan would publicly commit the airlines to several things that have 
been proposed by Congress and the Clinton administration, or which 
already are the law or are the current policies of some carriers. 
According to the draft, they include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Providing the lowest fare available on telephone reservation  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Notifying customers of known delays, cancellations and  
diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Return of checked baggage within 24 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the baggage liability limit from the current $1,250  
per bag. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowing reservations to be held or canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	--Providing prompt ticket refunds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing airline procedures for accommodating disabled  
passengers or minors traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing and disclosing policies for all passengers who are  
kept off a flight despite a confirmed reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing in advance aircraft seating plans, rules on frequent  
flier redemptions and ticket cancellation policies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensuring flight partners provide comparable customer service.  
</P>
<P>
	--Assuring that all written complaints are answered within 60  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The service commitment says the plans will be completed by Dec.  
15 and fully implemented by June 15, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Germany Emerges As Peace Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- German soldiers, long burdened by  
Germany's history of aggression, are preparing to enter Kosovo in 
the coming days representing their nation's new role as Continental 
peace mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	The German Cabinet and parliament were set to approve deployment  
of an 8,500-strong contingent Friday as part of the international 
peace force. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment to guarantee the safe return of Kosovo Albanian  
refugees marks ``the end of the Yugoslav wars'' after nearly 10 
years of bloodshed, Germany's Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer 
declared triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer has particular reason to celebrate. Making his debut in  
the diplomatic arena, the former taxi driver is credited with a 
large share of the diplomacy that enabled a peace deal with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the often-tense maneuvering, Fischer balanced  
Germany's troubled history, his own past as a peace activist and 
the German public's reluctance to engage in war with his conviction 
that NATO bombs were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we accept in Europe such a throwback back to the policies  
of the 1930s, I'm sure Milosevic wouldn't have stopped in Kosovo. 
We needed years to accept war,'' Fischer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me appeasement is not a bad word. But at the end when you  
realize there is no other means, you have to use'' force, Fischer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only weeks ago, as the threat grew that the NATO air campaign  
would be widened into a ground war, Fischer was the target of the 
nation's angst over the involvement in its first armed conflict 
since Adolf Hitler waged war on Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	As anti-war sentiment grew, Fischer was hit in the face by a  
paint balloon during a special meeting of his Greens Party to 
discuss Kosovo. He defied party pacifists who demanded an immediate 
bombing halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Though stung by the confrontation, Fischer persevered on the  
diplomatic front. ``The situation was often very difficult,'' he 
conceded Thursday, ``then all of a sudden it broke open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During three days of tough negotiations with foreign ministers  
from the world's richest democracies and Russia, Fischer 
demonstrated iron-willed politicking to secure a compromise to end 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Having helped ensure agreement on peace terms, Fischer turned  
his energy toward using the deal to push for a speedy end to the 
bombing. On Wednesday, he was overheard forcefully pressing the 
merits of a bombing pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's critical role in resolving the Kosovo crisis helps  
redefine a nation viewed for so long -- even by allies -- as a 
potential threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are all going to have a very interesting time  
studying the lessons of this struggle,'' Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raising Bid Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fund-raisers for Senate Democrats have  
come under fire for petitioning federal agencies for materials 
including letters and constituent requests sent to and from Senate 
Republicans up for re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., accused Democrats of looking for  
``trash at the expense of the privacy of my constituents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee defended the  
practice Thursday, saying the committee had no intention of 
violating anyone's privacy. Spokesman Jim Jordan described the 
requests as routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican attacks on the use of the Freedom of Information  
Act are indeed attacks on open government,'' Jordan said. ``One 
wonders whether or not there are specific transactions made by some 
of these senators that they simply don't want opened to public 
view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said their concerns involved individual privacy.  
Although agencies are required by law to withhold confidential and 
other private information, Republicans said mistakes sometimes 
happen and that senators could lose constituents' trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would put a permanent chill on the ability of senators to  
help constituents in need,'' Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., complained 
this week in a letter to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A request to the Department of Health and Human Services, a copy  
of which was obtained by The Associated Press, seeks ``letters, 
written materials, reports, constituent requests and other relevant 
material'' to and from senators or their aides. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Burns and Santorum, information was sought on  
Sens. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.; John Ashcroft, R-Mo.; Bill Frist, 
R-Tenn.; Slade Gorton, R-Wash.; Rod Grams, R-Minn.; James Jeffords, 
R-Vt.; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said Democrats made requests with ``numerous federal  
agencies'' but he would not name them. He said the Democratic 
committee would contact those agencies to clarify its needs and 
expectations with regard to privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said Republicans in the past have made similar requests  
of Democrats, citing contacts that Democratic senators had with 
various agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Republican Senatorial Committee, however, said it  
has made no Freedom of Information Act requests since Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., took over as chairman in 1997. Spokesman Stuart 
Roy said he did not know if there were any such requests before 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Evangelical Leaders Issue Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leaders of Evangelical Protestantism, who rarely  
speak with one voice, have issued a joint statement of doctrine 
defining what unites the movement and what distinguishes it from 
other forms of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the statement reaffirms the Evangelical  
belief that Jesus Christ ``is the only way of salvation. ... The 
Bible offers no hope that sincere worshippers of other religions 
will be saved without personal faith in Jesus Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Christians have promoted a more liberal and universal  
concept of salvation. 
</P>
<P>
	Evangelicalism -- a conservative wing of Protestantism  
representing, by some estimates, one-fourth of Americans -- is a 
network of denominations, congregations and independent ministries. 
Evangelicals generally share the same outlook, but the movement 
rarely takes joint action. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Evangelicalism's best-known figures, including religious  
broadcasters Jerry Falwell, D. James Kennedy, Pat Robertson and 
Charles Stanley, endorsed the statement. The 129 signers also 
include Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ and prison 
evangelist Charles Colson. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Graham did not sign, but one of his top aides served on  
the 15-member drafting committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The text -- which appears in the latest issue of Christianity  
Today magazine -- was also endorsed by leaders at four of the most 
important Evangelical seminaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianity Today executive editor David Neff said that  
Evangelicals ``have never put forth a large-scale defining document 
about the gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project began as a bid to define conservative Protestant  
views of salvation in contrast to those of Catholicism. But it 
quickly took up other topics, including disagreements with more 
liberal strains of Protestantism. 
</P>
<P>
	The text states that the Bible is ``infallible'' but says little  
about how to interpret Scripture. Evangelicals are divided, for 
example, over how literally to take the story of creation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evangelical movement has a subtle difference with Catholics  
on the role of faith and good works in salvation. Both groups teach 
that all people are sinful, but the Evangelical platform denies 
that people have any inherent righteousness. Catholicism has a 
slightly more optimistic view of humanity.

<HEADLINE> Steel Cos. Face Last Tariff Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. steel producers seeking tariffs to block  
low-priced shipments from Japan face their final -- and toughest -- 
hurdle Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission will decide whether the  
domestic industry is hurt by Japanese pricing practices already 
deemed illegal by the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel, the industry's leading  
product, would effectively make Japanese shipments too expensive to 
sell in the United States. The U.S. industry believes such 
sanctions are necessary to counter last year's surge in imports, 
which it blames for thousands of layoffs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's vote could affect future shipments from Japan  
as well as from other countries looking for signs of what practices 
are permissible. A negative vote also could boost support in 
Congress for global quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't give us the (tariffs), I think people would be  
outraged,'' said William Klinefelter, Washington representative of 
the United Steelworkers of America union. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry credits the threat of tariffs for the roughly  
40 percent drop in overall steel shipments from Japan and other 
countries since November. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot-rolled shipments from Japan dropped to 7,428 metric tons in  
April, compared with 405,974 in November. By comparison, shipments 
of the same product from Korea, which was not a target of the trade 
cases, remained at roughly 60,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruled in April that Japan violated U.S.  
trade laws by dumping hot-rolled steel in U.S. markets at prices 
below production costs or home-market prices. The department 
proposed tariffs of as much as 67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But before any tariffs are imposed, the trade commission must  
determine that the dumping has injured or threatens to hurt U.S. 
industry. While Commerce finds dumping in nearly all cases it 
reviews, the commission finds injury only about half the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ITC is the only place you can go to get even the potential  
of an objective review of the facts,'' said Russell Smith, a lawyer 
for Japanese steel producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member trade commission's vote Friday comes nearly a  
year after domestic producers filed their complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The factors the trade commission uses to evaluate injury are not  
as clear-cut as those used by Commerce, and include individual 
commissioners' assessments of the economic health of U.S. 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports rose following the Asian economic crisis, which drove  
down demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers to turn 
to the healthy U.S. economy for sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry accuses Japanese, Russian and Brazilian  
producers of dumping hot-rolled steel in the United States at 
unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has tentatively struck deals with  
Russia and Brazil in which those countries could avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily reducing steel shipments. That leaves Japan as the 
remaining target.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Gov. Announces Divorce Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Gov. Kirk Fordice ended years of  
speculation about another woman in his life when he announced 
Thursday that he is ending his marriage of 44 years to wed his 
childhood sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
	The 65-year-old two-term Republican, who has courted the  
religious right and harshly criticized President Clinton's affair 
with Monica Lewinsky, said he and Memphis widow Ann G. Creson will 
marry as soon as his divorce from Pat Fordice is final. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice is barred from serving a third term and has already said  
he will not seek another office when his term is up in January. He 
could become the first sitting governor of Mississippi to get 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came on the heels of a report that Fordice vacationed  
in Europe with Ms. Creson while Mrs. Fordice remained in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fordice marriage has repeatedly been in the news, and the  
quick-tempered governor has always insisted that his private life 
should stay private. Last month, it was revealed he bought a house 
in a Jackson suburb without inviting his wife to live there. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the governor was seen having lunch and holding  
hands with a woman near Memphis while his wife was in France. The 
woman was never identified. The story came out after Fordice was 
seriously injured in a car wreck on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, he lashed out at a TV reporter who confronted him  
about the European trip, telling the reporter he would ``whip your 
ass'' if he didn't leave his personal life alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice press secretary Robbie Wilbur said that for now, both  
Fordices are living in the Governor's Mansion. He did not know if 
Mrs. Fordice plans to remain there. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fordice's attorney, L.C. James, said his client was asked  
to join the governor in the announcement about the divorce, but 
``right now, her present inclination is to not have a divorce take 
place anytime in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would prefer to have their lives restored to some sort of  
normalcy so that she can focus on her duties as first lady,'' James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice attorney Jim Becker said in a statement that the  
Fordices had been estranged for some time and the divorce would be 
resolved ``equitably and with dignity.'' The couple, whose 44th 
wedding anniversary is in August, have four children and 10 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day, a sad situation for them. It's sad for a  
public figure, especially one who has promoted the importance of 
the family,'' said Forest Thigpen, head of a group that lobbies on 
pro-family issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice is serving as a national co-chairman of Dan Quayle's  
presidential campaign. Quayle is portraying himself as the family 
values candidate of the GOP presidential field in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's spokesman, Jonathan Baron, said Thursday that the  
former vice president is standing behind Fordice, adding, ``We are 
pleased to have such support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Creson, Fordice's junior high sweetheart, did not return  
calls to her home Thursday. Her husband of 43 years, Roy Franklin 
Creson Jr., died in November of cancer at 66. He was the retired 
owner of a manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice and his wife's marital troubles date to 1993, when he  
announced they were having ``irreconcilable differences.'' A day 
later, she issued a statement saying she would continue serving as 
first lady unless forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Mrs. Fordice said her husband had bought a $230,000  
home outside Jackson and never invited her to see it. She said she 
did not want a divorce, though she knew her husband's new home 
``wasn't for me.''

<HEADLINE> Auditor: AMA Loses Money, Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An auditor's report shows the American Medical  
Association lost money on operations last year -- and lost about 
2,700 members. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of $2.6 million in membership dues was the biggest  
factor in the AMA's operating loss, the report showed. The AMA lost 
$141,000 on operations, compared to an operating income of $6.3 
million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always concerned about operating losses, and we are  
doing everything we can with membership activities,'' said Dr. 
Timothy Flaherty, the AMA's secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty said the AMA probably would have made money on  
operations but has undertaken a costly project to accredit doctors' 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the nation's largest organization of doctors has  
been declining for years. The latest wave has been blamed largely 
on the AMA's decision in 1997 to endorse products marketed by the 
Sunbeam Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA backed away from that deal after an outcry from its  
members and outside critics, but had to pay $9.9 million to settle 
a lawsuit brought by Sunbeam.

<HEADLINE> Winston Won't Sponsor Race Driver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- The president of Sports Marketing  
Enterprises division of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said Thursday the 
company's Winston brand will not renew its contract with Travis 
Carter Enterprises after the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff Pennell said the Winston brand does not plan future  
sponsorship of a NASCAR Winston Cup entry at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, a longtime crew chief and car owner, fields the No. 23  
Ford Taurus driven by Jimmy Spencer, as well as the No. 66 Taurus 
driven by Darrell Waltrip and sponsored by Big Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was purely a business decision,'' said Pennell, adding  
that performance was not the biggest factor in the company's 
decision to end its sponsorship after six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary reason for this decision is to allow the Winston  
brand to focus its efforts and resources on the NASCAR Winston Cup 
Series. We are fortunate to be the series sponsor of the largest 
and fastest-growing series in motorsports, and we simply want to 
focus our efforts in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said, ``This six-year association with R.J. Reynolds and  
SME has been the best of my career. The people at RJR and SME have 
been extremely supportive, tolerant and understanding of racing and 
this team's ups and downs. The last 5 1/2 years have been more like a 
family relationship than a sponsorship relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision from RJR was not totally unexpected, and I've  
actually been looking for a sponsor for quite some time,'' Carter 
said. ``... I'm very optimistic about the future of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer finished 14th last season, his best finish since joining  
Carter in 1995. Both of his Winston Cup victories came in 1994 
while he was driving for Junior Johnson.

<HEADLINE> NL Investigating Valentine Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Who was that masked man in the New York Mets  
dugout? 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently it was manager Bobby Valentine.  
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't confusing Wednesday night's game against Toronto with  
Halloween. Valentine merely returned to the bench incognito after 
he was thrown out by umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the information we have, he was ejected and came back to  
the end of the dugout in a disguise,'' NL senior vice president 
Katy Feeney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning by plate umpire Randy  
Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call on Mike Piazza. The 
manager, according to information reported to the NL, returned to 
the dugout with a fake mustache and glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeney said the league was investigating and hopes to have a  
decision by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	An eight-game losing streak, the team's longest in three years,  
prompted general manager Steve Phillips to fire three of 
Valentine's coaches last Saturday, a move the manager didn't agree 
with. Two of those fired, pitching coach Bob Apodaca and hitting 
coach Tom Robson, were close to Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the firings, the Mets have won four straight.  
</P>
<P>
	In other Mets turmoil, outfielder Bobby Bonilla told the team he  
was unavailable to play in Tuesday's and Wednesday's games, The New 
York Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is a situation,'' Valentine was quoted as  
saying by the paper. ``I'm just going to say he wasn't available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, hitting .167 with four homers and 17 RBIs, didn't take  
batting practice Wednesday and exchanged bitter words with 
Valentine before the game, the Post reported. Last week, Bonilla 
was upset after a report the Mets had placed him on waivers and he 
wasn't claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, outfielder Benny Agbayani was cleared to return Friday.  
The rookie, hitting .409 with eight homers in 66 at-bats, bruised 
his right eye in batting practice Wednesday when he hit a ball off 
the cage and it bounced back into his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets said a CT scan was negative and eye specialist Dr.  
Bruce Zagelbaum said Agbayani could return Friday against Boston.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Wants To Cut Kosovo Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as members of both parties welcomed the  
Kosovo peace accord, the Republican-led House forged ahead today on 
legislation that would bar funds for peacekeeping operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they were incredulous at the timing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never in the history of this country has a Congress voted to  
deprive America of an American victory in the field after it has 
been achieved,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat 
on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans declined to back away from a provision in a  
defense spending bill that would bar funds for either a military or 
peacekeeping mission in the Balkans after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The president could spend money for such an operation only by  
citing national security concerns and sending separate legislation 
to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a new and perhaps more troubling phase for our  
country,'' said the Armed Services Committee chairman, Rep. Floyd 
Spence, R-S.C. ``Administration policy has been contentious and 
confusing, not only for Congress but for the American people as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP provision has drawn a veto threat from the  
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans are trying to strike that  
provision from a $288.8 billion defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., supports the restriction  
but praised the peace agreement and U.S. forces in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the people of Yugoslavia see this as an opportunity to  
replace their leadership, especially Mr. Milosevic,'' Hastert said 
in reference to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are opposing use of U.S. taxes in rebuilding  
Serbia, outside the province of Kosovo, as long as Milosevic 
remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton expressed his opposition to the provision in separate  
late-morning phone calls to both Hastert and Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelton said the president told him he fully intends to send a  
request to Congress well before Sept. 30 to seek money for the 
peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials said Clinton made a similar pledge in his  
conversation with Hastert -- and he also suggested it was premature 
to discuss the peacekeeping operation in any detail during the 
current debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, as the House resumed debate on the defense measure,  
Hastert told reporters, ``We are thrilled, very very happy, 
relieved that there is an agreement in Kosovo. ... I think we can 
all be very happy and prayerful that that's happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert added that the United States had already paid too  
much of the cost of the operation. When it comes to peacekeeping 
and rebuilding, he said he wants to make sure ``we aren't saddled 
with picking up the major part of the that burden as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted late Wednesday to end another U.S.  
peacekeeping force -- the one that has been in Haiti since March 
1995. The House voted 227-198 to pull the permanent force out of 
the Caribbean nation by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our troops have been fired on in Haiti. ... Things have gone  
sour in Haiti,'' said Sen. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee and the sponsor of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to leave our troops in Haiti in an open-ended  
deployment,'' agreed Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a permanent force, the measure would allow  
``periodic, noncontinuous'' troop deployments there. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents complained that the peacekeeping force in Haiti  
numbered fewer than 500 troops. ``Haiti does not have an army now 
because they agreed to get rid of it,'' said Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich. ``Our troops are not in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House also rejected, as it has done in past years, a  
proposal to liberalize the ban on abortions at military hospitals 
overseas. It turned back, 225-203, a proposal to allow the 
procedures if the woman paid for it with her own funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was also expected to take up a proposal by Rep. Tillie  
Fowler, R-Fla., that would require the president to get express 
prior approval from Congress before sending any forces to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted 428-0 for a package of amendments  
from members of a House committee that last month concluded China 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets over a 20-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	The package beefs up counterintelligence programs at the Energy  
Department, requires polygraph tests of employees at national 
laboratories, restricts lab visits by foreigners and requires a 
barrage of new reports to Congress on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1401

<HEADLINE> Summary of Supreme Court Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Struck down a Chicago law aimed at combating crime by street  
gangs. The 6-3 ruling said the law, which barred gang members and 
their friends from loitering in public ``with no apparent 
purpose,'' was unconstitutionally vague. Justice John Paul Stevens 
wrote for the majority that the ordinance gave police officers too 
much discretion. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the court 
may have ``unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to lives of 
terror and misery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited the use during criminal trials of out-of-court  
statements by alleged accomplices who admit some wrongdoing but try 
to pin the blame on the defendant. The justices' divided ruling 
said Virginia courts violated a murder defendant's constitutional 
right to confront the witnesses against him by allowing such 
statements by his brother to be used as evidence although the 
brother did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
	--Made it harder for prosecutors to prove federal cases alleging  
bank, wire or mail fraud. The court unanimously ruled in a Florida 
case that prosecutors in such cases must prove that an allegedly 
fraudulent act affected the outcome of the transaction. However, 
the court also said, 6-3, that in tax fraud cases -- where proof of 
legal relevance also is required -- a judge's failure to submit the 
question to the jury can be considered harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled for the government in a patent-law dispute, narrowing a  
specialized court's authority to second-guess federal officials' 
decisions on which inventions deserve patent protection. The 6-3 
ruling said a federal appeals court that specializes in technical 
cases must give more deference to decisions by the Patent and 
Trademark Office.

<HEADLINE>  Hoops Hall of Famers Are Nominated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale, who played in a great  
Boston Celtics frontcourt with Larry Bird and Robert Parish, has 
been nominated to the Basketball Hall of Fame, along with three 
other Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Boston players are Dennis Johnson, who won a total of  
three championship rings with Boston and Seattle; Jo Jo White, who 
played with two championship Celtics teams and won an Olympic gold 
medal in 1968; and Wayne Embry, who won an NBA championship with 
the Celtics in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	John Thompson, who coached Georgetown to the 1984 NCAA  
championship and 14 straight NCAA tournaments, also is a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Hall of Famers will be selected June 21. They will  
be picked from the nominees announced Thursday by officials at the 
Springfield shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	For enshrinement, a nominee needs 18 of 24 votes from the Honors  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought to the Celtics in 1980 with Parish, McHale at first was  
the team's sixth man. He went on to play 12 seasons in the all-star 
frontcourt that included Bird. The team won NBA championships in 
1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a go-to guy, just like Larry Bird,'' said Red Auerbach,  
the Celtics vice chairman and former coach who brought McHale to 
the team. ``When you need a basket real bad and the game is on the 
line, you can go to McHale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 McHale honed his offensive skills by playing  
against his high school coach one-on-one in the small town of 
Hibbing, Minn. McHale's agility, long arms and array of moves 
allowed him to shoot over even taller NBA defenders. He averaged 18 
points per game with 55 percent shooting during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, McHale set a Celtics record with 56 points against the  
Detroit Pistons. Bird broke the record nine days later with 60 
points against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird praised McHale, once saying he ``never saw a triple-team he  
didn't like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale also was picked for three NBA Defensive First Teams, as  
well as seven All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale now is vice president of basketball operations for the  
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who was backup center for Bill Russell on the 1965 and  
1966 championship Celtics, coached the Hoyas for 27 years. His 
teams went 596-239, reached the Final Four three times, and beat 
Houston in the 1984 final. The NBA drafted 26 of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	He resigned in January. Since then, he has worked as a radio  
talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	Other nominees this year are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Bob McAdoo, a three-time scoring champion and two-time NBA  
champion with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Maurice Cheeks of the 1983 NBA championship Philadelphia team.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Gus Johnson of the Baltimore Bullets.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sidney Moncrief of the Milwaukee Bucks  
</P>
<P>
	-- Chet Walker, who won a championship with Philadelphia in 1967  
with Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan, whose 800-442 record gives  
him more wins than any other active college coach. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tex Winter, an assistant Chicago Bulls coach who has spent 52  
seasons at Division I college and NBA teams -- more than any active 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And Morgan Wootten, the coach at DeMatha High School in  
Washington, D.C., whose record of 1,185-178 is the best ever for a 
high school coach.

<HEADLINE> IRS Denies Christian Coalition Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Christian Coalition, struggling to regain  
influence and contributors, is undergoing a major reorganization 
triggered by the denial of its request for tax-exempt status. 
Founder Pat Robertson said Thursday the organization would 
``continue to be a force in American politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service first denied tax-exempt status to  
the group last year in a ruling kept under wraps pending appeal. 
The Christian Coalition was notified in recent weeks that it would 
lose the appeal and decided to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS concluded that certain Christian Coalition activities  
were too partisan for the group to enjoy tax-exempt status. Its 
most visible activity is distribution of voter guides at churches 
around the country; some 72 million were given out in 1998, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the coalition will not enjoy the tax benefits of a  
nonprofit religious organization. Some critics said the IRS ruling 
could cost the group grassroots support and will require it to 
observe legal limits on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's long awaited and it's very appropriate,'' said Carole  
Shields, president of the liberal People for the American Way. ``We 
think everybody ought to play by the same rules. A lot of what they 
want to do is properly done by a political action committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition officials estimate the organization will owe  
the IRS between $300,000 and $400,000 in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition spokesman Mike Russell said the organization's changes  
would include creation of a new Christian Coalition International, 
which would form a PAC and engage in partisan activity including 
candidate endorsements and political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said the Christian Coalition of Texas, which is  
currently a tax-exempt group, will be renamed Christian Coalition 
of America and will limit its activity to nonprofit ``voter 
education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization has been dramatically reshaped but its  
mission statement remains intact and it will continue to do the 
things it has been doing since it formed, which is recruit 
pro-family activists, draw people to the polls in record numbers 
for elections and educate,'' Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christian Coalition of America will continue to be a force in  
American politics and will remain a prominent fixture on the 
political landscape as the nation's number one pro-family, pro-life 
organization,'' said Robertson, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the IRS decision adds to the problems faced by the  
Christian Coalition following the departure two years ago of Ralph 
Reed as executive director. Amid waning influence and dips in 
fund-raising, the coalition also faces challenges from other 
religious-focused groups, such as the Family Research Council, that 
want to emerge as the next powerhouse of the Republican right wing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are clearly trying to get their sea legs under them and  
get back into the discourse,'' said Rich Galen, executive director 
of the GOPAC fund-raising organization. ``They are obviously 
undergoing some internal strife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said he believed the IRS ruling would not cause many  
additional problems for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really see this as having a lot of impact,'' he said.  
``People are most concerned about whether we were we out there 
fighting the good fight. They don't care about names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some advisers to Robertson had urged him last year to form a  
for-profit political organizations but he balked. One of those 
advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the faction had 
been concerned that losing the IRS appeal would hurt the group's 
reputation among social conservatives who expected the coalition to 
abide by the letter and the spirit of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also coincides with several moves by Robertson to  
assume more authority over the group, including moving executive 
director Randy Tate from the Chesapeake, Va. headquarters to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Lynn, a longtime critic of the coalition, said the  
political implications are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Christian Coalition is a hardball political machine that  
is masquerading as a religious group. The evidence is overwhelming 
that this organization has been operating as virtually an arm of 
the Republican Party,'' said Lynn, executive director of Americans 
United for Separation of Church and State. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS decision to deny the coalition's appeal was first  
reported Thursday by the St. Petersburg Times.

<HEADLINE> Court Makes It Harder To Prove Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it harder for  
prosecutors to prove federal cases alleging bank, wire or mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously that prosecutors in such cases must  
prove that an allegedly fraudulent act affected the outcome of the 
transaction. The justices ordered a lower court to re-examine a 
Florida man's convictions for fraudulently obtaining more than $30 
million in loans for land purchase and development deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also ruled 6-3 that in tax fraud cases -- where proof  
of legal relevance also is required -- a judge's failure to submit 
that question to the jury sometimes can be considered harmless. The 
justices upheld Ellis E. Neder Jr.'s conviction of tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hold that materiality of falsehood is an element of the  
federal mail fraud, wire fraud and bank fraud statutes,'' Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Neder, of Jacksonville, was charged with fraudulently obtaining  
loans for his projects from 1984 to 1988. He defaulted on the loans 
and failed to report $5.7 million in income on his tax returns, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and tax  
fraud. The trial judge told jurors that if they decided Neder's 
statements were false, the judge would decide whether they were 
``material,'' or legally relevant to the outcome of the 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Neder was convicted on numerous counts and sentenced to 12 years  
and three months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that jurors, not judges, must  
decide issues of legal relevance if they are an element of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Neder's  
convictions. The court ruled that the mail, wire and bank fraud 
laws did not require proof that Neder's statements were legally 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the tax fraud law does require such  
proof. But because Neder did not dispute the issue, the judge's 
error in failing to submit the issue to the jury could be 
considered harmless, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neder's lawyers argued to the Supreme Court that legal relevance  
is always an essential element of a fraud charge, even if it is not 
spelled out in the law. They also said a judge's failure to let a 
jury decide on an essential element of the tax fraud charge cannot 
be considered harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court reversed the 11th Circuit court on the bank,  
wire and mail fraud issues. The justices ordered the lower court to 
decide whether the error in failing to have the jury decide on 
legal relevance could be considered harmless in Neder's case. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices upheld the lower court on the tax fraud issue.  
Joining Rehnquist in that part of the opinion were Justices Sandra 
Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. 
Breyer. Justice John Paul Stevens agreed with the result but for 
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg  
dissented from the ruling on the tax fraud charge. A failure to 
have a jury rule on an essential element of a charge can never be 
considered harmless, Scalia wrote for the three. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Neder vs. U.S., 97-1985.

<HEADLINE> 'Austin Powers' To Test the Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Early test audiences didn't quite understand  
it, and the opening weekend box office was nothing to write home to 
mum about. 
</P>
<P>
	But people started to get the swing of ``Austin Powers:  
International Man of Mystery.'' The modestly budgeted film made a 
respectable $54 million at the box office, then became a phenomenon 
on video. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, this quirky creation of Mike Myers, who was inspired by  
bittersweet memories of his comedy-loving, Liverpool-born father, 
has a sequel coming out this weekend, one that poses the first 
serious challenge to the ``Star Wars'' juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is accompanied by an  
aggressive, if somewhat unusual, promotional campaign: a major 
soundtrack with an original song by Madonna, toys, watches, 
T-shirts and a parade of magazine covers, from Rolling Stone with 
Myers in Austin persona, to the pet publication Cats, fronted with 
the hairless wonder Mr. Bigglesworth, the feline friend of Austin's 
nemesis, Dr. Evil (also played by Myers, in heavy makeup). 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just now the question of whether the audience likes it  
enough,'' said director Jay Roach, who also directed the first 
Austin Powers movie. ``We're not presuming it will. We love all the 
hype, but we have to live up to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myers says he is still stunned by how well the character has  
caught on. He said he never grows tired of people launching into 
bad Powers imitations of, ``Oh, behave!'' and ``Yeah, baby!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored,'' he said. ``Jay and I thought it was the  
consummate in-joke: You would have had to have grown up in my house 
to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin'' gets its comic sensibilities from British TV shows  
like Benny Hill and ``Monty Python.'' Myers' father adored these 
shows. And Myers adored his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Myers was born in England but moved the family to Canada.  
He sold Encyclopedia Britannica and insurance. He used to let Myers 
and his two brothers stay up late on school nights to watch 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad loved comedy so much,'' said Myers. ``One of my  
strongest memories is hearing my father laugh through the walls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Years passed and Mike Myers became famous, first on ``Saturday  
Night Live,'' then with the hit movie ``Wayne's World.'' But as his 
career took off, his father's health declined, from Alzheimer's. 
Chris Myers died in 1991, and never saw his son make it big in 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very weird. My heart was broken,'' said Myers.  
</P>
<P>
	He took 18 months off from show business to read, play guitar  
and visit his aunts and uncles in Liverpool. It was during this 
time that the ``Austin Powers'' character was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was driving home and I heard 'The Look of Love' (from 1967)  
on the radio, and you know how smell is a very potent sense memory, 
I think that songs do it, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The memory was of his father.  
</P>
<P>
	``And I just started talking like 'Austin,' and I was saying to  
my wife (in an Austin accent), 'Do I make you horny, baby? Do I?''' 
he recalled. ``It just came out like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three weeks he had a script and quickly got a film deal with  
New Line Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first ``Austin Powers,'' shot on a $16 million budget,  
didn't go well with the first test audiences. People didn't get the 
jokes. In one screening, the film broke and Myers had to entertain 
the audience with a stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' opened with a  
disappointing $9.5 million in May 1997. But it held on in the 
summer of ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' to more than recoup its 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it exploded on video. It was the No. 1 selling video on the  
Billboard charts in 1998 and remains in the Top 10, selling more 
than 3 million tapes, or $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where the kind of grassroots worship of the movie  
began,'' said New Line production president Mike Deluca. ``It kind 
of caught on. It had a second life.'' People threw Austin Powers 
parties, and Dr. Evil's loopy reminiscences were inscribed on 
T-shirts. (``My father would womanize, he would drink... he would 
make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark.'') 
</P>
<P>
	With this success behind it, New Line doubled the budget for the  
sequel and scheduled it for the important summer season. The 
anticipation built with a trailer that cleverly played off the hype 
surrounding ``The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the sequel, the super spy/fashion photographer with a deep  
ply carpet of chest hair goes back in time to retrieve his stolen 
mojo, what Myers describes as Austin's life-giving force -- his 
libido. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the first film, when no corporate sponsor would touch it,  
the sequel comes with a promotional campaign and product placement 
deals. (Starbucks coffee has a prominent -- and hilarious -- 
appearance.) 
</P>
<P>
	``The character of Austin is so contagious,'' said DeLuca.  
``That kind of contagious enthusiasm kind of spread to the tie-in 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One major partner is Virgin Atlantic Airways, which has featured  
Austin Powers in randy billboards (``There's only one Virgin on 
this billboard, baby'') and a radio spot in which Austin rattles 
off one euphemism after another for his favorite body part. 
</P>
<P>
	Another spot plays on the word ``shag,'' in America a quaint  
term for sex that most people link only to Austin Powers, but a 
profane word in Great Britain. Virgin Atlantic isn't running the 
``shag ads'' there, but says that's because it never runs the same 
commercials in the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not unusual for Virgin, run by adventurer Richard Branson,  
to use its name for comedic effect in commercials, and the Austin 
campaign was a perfect fit, according to Sarah Buxton, director of 
marketing for Virgin Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only are we not very big and up against airlines, but we  
only have one destination: London,'' she said. ``We like to say in 
a world of frequent flyer miles, people are married to other 
airlines, but they have an affair with Virgin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah, baby!

<HEADLINE> Woman Accused in Cosby Case Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Calif. (AP) -- Autumn Jackson was released from prison  
Thursday, a day after a court overturned her conviction for trying 
to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby by threatening to tell the 
tabloids she was his illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson was driven away from a minimum-security women's  
prison by her mother, Shawn Upshaw, who had an affair with the 
comedian in the 1970s and had accepted more than $100,000 in 
support from him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson, 24, served 14 months of a 26-month sentence for  
extortion, conspiracy and crossing state lines to commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But On Wednesday the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the  
trial judge improperly instructed the jury on the law of extortion. 
The court also overturned the convictions of two accomplices for 
the same reason, ordering a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the appeals court said ``evidence at trial was plainly  
sufficient to support verdicts of guilty had the jury been properly 
instructed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the judge should have told jurors that in  
order to convict Ms. Jackson they needed to find that she had 
wrongful intent. That would have allowed the jury to consider 
whether Ms. Jackson truly believed she was Cosby's daughter and 
therefore did not have any wrongful intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not decided whether to appeal or ask for a  
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson made no public comments at the prison Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Faulk a No-Show at Rams Minicamp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Marshall Faulk is back to his no-deal, no-show  
stance. 
</P>
<P>
	While the running back waits for his contract to be reworked,  
he's sitting out the St. Louis Rams' minicamp that began Thursday. 
Coach Dick Vermeil said it was out of sight, out of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'm disappointed he's not here, but that's his  
prerogative,'' Vermeil said. ``I thought he would be here, but he 
and his agent made that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, it's a dead issue. He is not the  
topic of conversation around here. He knows where he belongs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Rams acquired Faulk from the Indianapolis Colts two  
days before the draft, he said he would attend no team functions 
until he got a new deal. He changed his mind for the first minicamp 
last month and showed up as an act of ``good faith,'' but 
apparently has had another change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are believed to be offering Faulk a multiyear deal that  
would pay him about $5 million a year and Vermeil said he thought 
the negotiations were going well. Faulk's agent, Rocky Arceneaux of 
St. Louis, wasn't that upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux said he and the Rams have spoken only once this week  
and that no deal was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt he showed some good faith and we thought that would  
give the negotiations a little more momentum,'' Arceneaux said. 
``It didn't give them enough momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just decided that in Marshall's best interests it was best  
he not go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his holdout, Faulk has been working out in St. Louis with  
noted trainer Bobby Kersee. 
</P>
<P>
	The minicamp is mandatory, so Faulk could be fined for failing  
to show. That appears unlikely, since the team's stance has been 
that Faulk would be treated as if he were a first-round draft pick. 
Unlike Vermeil, the Rams front office doesn't appear concerned 
about signing Faulk until training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither, really, are his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``We understand he has to do what he has to do,'' tight end  
Roland Williams said. ``He came to the first minicamp and let us 
know how he felt about the team and how much he wants to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk rushed for 1,319 yards and caught 86 passes last year and  
is set to make a base salary of $2.2 million next season under 
terms of the original seven-year deal he signed out of college. The 
Rams acquired him for second- and fifth-round draft picks.

<HEADLINE> Judge May Dismiss Caldera Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal judge signaled again Thursday  
that he likely will allow Caldera's David vs. Goliath lawsuit 
against Microsoft to go forward largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorneys had convinced U.S. District Judge Dee Benson  
to break the case into nine separate pieces, then tried to convince 
the judge to dismiss each claim piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, both sides conceded that the judge was leaning  
toward denying Microsoft's requests for summary judgment, and 
allowing Caldera's attorneys to argue that the pieces of the case -- 
while not indicative of illegal activity themselves -- can be 
cobbled together to make the case against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson likened the bits to the O.J. Simpson murder trial, where  
prosecutors used an assortment of evidence -- blood, physical 
evidence and expert testimony -- to persuade jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all (Caldera's attorneys) want to do here,'' Benson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera claims that Microsoft built in technical glitches to  
keep the Windows 3.1 software from working on the DR-DOS operating 
system Caldera purchased from Novell in 1996. Microsoft argues the 
company merely improved its Windows 3.0 software. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera attorney Parker C. Folse III said that Windows 3.1 so  
revolutionized the computer world that the suggestion that the 
software might not work on DR-DOS devastated its sales. 
</P>
<P>
	An operating system controls the computer's basic functions, and  
is needed to execute program management software, such as 
Microsoft's Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, Microsoft used its monopoly in the Windows program  
management software to strengthen a monopoly for its MS-DOS 
operating system, Caldera argued. Caldera is seeking damages which 
Microsoft attorney Jim Jardine has said would reach $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft attorney Richard H. Klapper argued that Microsoft  
was under no obligation to make sure Windows 3.1 worked on any 
operating system other than its own. Nor, he argued, was Microsoft 
required to provide Caldera with an advanced copy of the program so 
Caldera could make sure it was compatible with DR-DOS.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen Thursday  
after riding a foreign exchange rollercoaster that included an 
unusual intervention by the Bank of Japan that boosted the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell against the euro as traders bought euros  
and dumped Swiss francs, helping the euro strengthen overall. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.84  
Japanese yen, down from 118.93 late Wednesday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0489, up from $1.0465. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially fell during Asian trading after Japan's  
Economic Planning Agency reported that the economy grew in the 
first quarter, marking the first expansion after five quarters of 
contraction. Japan is experiencing its worst recession since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar rose as the Bank of Japan intervened in currency  
markets on the dollar's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually a country intervenes on behalf of its own currency, but  
Japanese officials recently expressed dissatisfaction with 
dollar/yen volatility. The dollar was worth more than 122 yen at 
the beginning of the month; it fell as low as 117.63 yen after the 
data were released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank confirmed the operation, also a rarely seen phenomenon.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think essentially it was a smoothing operation,'' said  
Dennis Heidt, chief currency dealer at Banque Paribas. ``They 
thought the currency was getting too volatile. I don't think it was 
any line in the sand: 'It won't go below 117.''' 
</P>
<P>
	But after the intervention, the market considered itself  
overextended and gradually sold off after the dollar reached 119.95 
yen in less than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went too far too fast,'' Heidt said. Meanwhile, ``the move  
down was gradual and orderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5225 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.5222, and 1.4624 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4730. The British pound rose to $1.6054 from $1.6026. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8646 German marks, down from 1.8688; 6.2539 French francs, down 
from 6.2696; and 1,845.02 Italian lire, down from 1,851.85.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Allow Carry-On Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weighing safety against a person's right  
to polish off his $3.70 double mochaccino, the government has 
decided that airline passengers can keep cups of coffee they've 
carried onto airplanes even through takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came Wednesday, several weeks after a flight  
attendant for Alaska Airlines complained that the FAA inspector 
overseeing the West Coast carrier was forcing it to collect 
carry-on coffee cups out of concern that passengers could be 
splashed with hot liquid if a plane made a sudden stop while 
taxiing. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors overseeing Alaska's competitors, especially those  
flying out of a coffee hot spot such as Seattle, did not have the 
same rule -- prompting complaints of unfairness. That triggered an 
agency review of the consistency and common sense of some rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorandum being sent to the agency's airline inspectors,  
Nick Lacey, head of flight standards for the FAA, said passengers 
could keep their coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will also write to airlines saying they may want to  
evaluate their preflight routine so flight attendants are given an 
opportunity to ask passengers if they want to discard any carry-on 
items before takeoff, said FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under review is the agency's policy regarding glassware,  
Duquette said. Some U.S. carriers have complained that they are at 
a disadvantage with foreign counterparts because the FAA requires 
them to collect all glassware before a plane begins taxiing. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines like to pamper passengers in first and business class  
with china, linen and crystal service, but the policy forces them 
to collect glasses and pour drinks into plastic cups once a plane 
leaves the gate. Until now, even those cups have had to be 
collected before takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA rulebook says passengers must put all items in the  
overhead compartments or under the seat in front of them before 
takeoff and landing. There are exceptions for such items as books 
or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA rules also require airlines to collect ``service items,''  
which could range from a preflight drink to a food tray left over 
from the meal service. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules have come into question with the reduction in airline  
food service and the boom in airport concession stands. 
Increasingly, hungry travelers are bringing entire meals aboard 
their flights.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An Air Force mechanic died Thursday  
from injuries he suffered in last week's crash of an American 
Airlines jet, raising the death toll to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Sgt. Jeffery Stewart, 33, died of multiple injuries. He  
was on life support after Flight 1420 crashed off the end of a 
runway in a thunderstorm, broke apart and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people died at the scene, including the pilot. More than 80  
of the 145 passengers and crew members were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who had been based on Okinawa Island in Japan, was  
coming to Little Rock Air Force Base for training in jet-engine 
repair, Master Sgt. Scott Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Brings Momentum to Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- If success breeds success, Bobby Labonte  
figures to be the driver to beat in the NASCAR Kmart 400 at 
Michigan Speedway Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who won twice at this 2-mile banked oval in 1995, had  
been running well this season for the Joe Gibbs team. But he hadn't 
been winning until last week when he drove his Pontiac to a victory 
at Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence means a lot in racing, just like it does in other  
sports,'' Labonte said Thursday. ``We were able to build off past 
weeks to get to last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with coming in to Michigan with a win,  
no matter where it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The difference at Dover was a set of shocks Labonte borrowed  
from teammate Tony Stewart's car. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked so well that Labonte set a track record at Dover  
Downs International Speedway while earning the pole for the MBNA 
Platinum 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's setup for the Michigan track will be different, but no  
less important. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get your car set up right here,'' Labonte said.  
``That's the big thing, to get good power and a good setup. We've 
been fortunate, we've run well every time we've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte gives much of the credit to Jimmy Makar, his crew chief  
since 1995 when he joined the Gibbs team. 
</P>
<P>
	In his win at Dover, a key call by Makar played a major role in  
the triumph. Makar brought in Labonte to top off his fuel tank just 
before the end of the final caution period on lap 293. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just enough to get him to the finish.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like gas-mileage racing because you want to have the  
fastest car and run away,'' Labonte said. ``But it was a great call 
by Jimmy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cost Jeff Gordon the Dover race for the second  
straight year. He was forced to stop for a splash of gas with five 
laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is hoping to win on pure power at the bigger, faster  
track in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those deals where we like coming to this track,''  
Labonte said. ``It seems like we've got a good setup for it and 
good combination for it between Jimmy Makar and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is third in the Winston Cup point standings with 1,915.  
Dale Jarrett is first with 1,984 and Jeff Burton, a three-time 
winner, has 1,933 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been competitive week in and week out,'' Labonte said.  
``We've had some decent finishes, and we haven't had too much bad 
luck. We hope we can keep it going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the defending champion in this race -- the 14th of  
34 this season -- is fourth in the standings with 1,854 points. 
Martin, after a career-best seven victories last year, has won only 
once this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gordon, he could be in the right place to start making  
things happen. Martin, second to Gordon last season, has won four 
times at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte's teammate, Stewart, is fifth with 1,700 points. Gordon,  
last year's Winston Cup points champion, is sixth with 1,645 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has had a run of bad luck lately, won at Michigan  
last August.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Budget Strategy Passing Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Dennis Hastert's new strategy on  
spending bills passed its latest test Thursday as the House 
approved a $1.92 billion measure financing Congress' own 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	As it did, the Clinton administration issued its first veto  
threat of the year against spending legislation, complaining that a 
Senate measure would cut funds for local police, the 2000 census 
and other programs too deeply. The threat was a vivid reminder that 
repeated budget clashes between President Clinton and lawmakers 
remain a near certainty this year. 
</P>
<P>
	House passage of the congressional spending measure on a largely  
party-line 214-197 vote kept alive the momentum GOP leaders 
acquired only Tuesday, when the chamber passed its first 
appropriations bill for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That occurred only after Hastert called for Republican unity in  
a dramatic closed-door meeting and agreed to make new cuts in 
several bills, pleasing conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Following through on that strategy, GOP leaders offered an  
amendment cutting $54 million from the measure financing Congress 
that passed by voice vote. Top Republicans had initially planned to 
cut only about $26 million from the bill, but sidestepped a fresh 
conservative rebellion by adding $28 million in cuts from the 
account financing members' own offices. Conservatives initially 
sought a cut totaling $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can live with it,'' Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., said  
of the $54 million cut. Young chairs the House Appropriations 
Committee, which wrote the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats tried blocking the House from even debating the  
spending bill, hoping that enough Republicans would join them to 
succeed. They prolonged debate into the evening with a parade of 
procedural votes, losing every one. And in a near party-line roll 
call the House voted 216-194 to consider the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a cut for cut's sake'' in which GOP leaders  
are ``continuing to pander to the right wing,'' said Rep. Steny 
Hoyer, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP House margin is so narrow that Democrats need defections  
from only six Republicans to prevail. They were hoping to deal a 
major embarrassment to Hastert, R-Ill., only two days after GOP 
leaders thought they had rallied their troops behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers' votes on the bill financing Congress can be tough to  
predict, since it finances their own staffs and the taxpayer-paid 
mail on which they rely to help re-elect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The $28 million cut in members' office expenses would keep that  
account at $385 million, the same as this year. The original bill 
planned a 7.3 percent increase, well above the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders said the increase was necessary to cover inflation and  
to give their aides a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Before passage, a provision was deleted that would have required  
House offices to begin recycling their own trash. Some Republicans 
said they oppose forcing lawmakers to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  
its own $1.7 billion version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill covers Senate expenses and joint congressional items  
like the Capitol architect. The House bill covers House expenses 
and joint items. When combined, the price tag will be about $2.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel also approved a $35.3 billion measure financing  
the departments of Commerce, State and Justice. White House budget 
chief Jacob Lew sent Senate leaders a letter threatening a veto 
because the bill doesn't provide $1.3 billion Clinton wanted to 
hire local police officers and because it cuts the amount of money 
the administration wanted for the census, embassy construction and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate committee also approved an $8.3 billion bill  
financing military construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved all three bills by 27-0.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Speaks Out for Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged  
Harvard graduates to strive for integrity and avoid the temptation 
to cut corners in their professional lives. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech prepared for delivery at afternoon commencement  
ceremonies in Cambridge, Mass., Greenspan conceded today that his 
advice ran the risk of ``sounding a bit uncool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he asked the 1999 graduating class to listen to the  
``musings of an old, idealistic central banker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he believed strongly that ``your success in life  
and the success of our country is going to depend on the integrity 
and other qualities of character'' demonstrated by coming 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``A generation from now, as you watch your children graduate,  
you will want to be able to say that whatever success you achieved 
was the result of honest and productive work and that you dealt 
with people the way you would want them to deal with you,'' 
Greenspan said in his prepared remarks, which were distributed in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not deny that many appear to have succeeded in a material  
way by cutting corners and manipulating associates, both in their 
professional and personal lives. But material success is possible 
in this world and far more satisfying when it comes without 
exploiting others,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The true measure of a career is to be able to be content, even  
proud, that you succeeded through your own endeavors without 
leaving a trail of casualties in your wake,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust is at the root of any economic system based on mutually  
beneficial exchange,'' Greenspan said. He said that integrity and 
trust were not only sound moral principles but sound economic 
precepts as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without mutual trust, and market participants abiding by a  
rule of law, no economy can prosper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While financial markets have grown increasingly worried that the  
Federal Reserve may soon start raising interest rates to fight 
inflation, Greenspan made no mention of monetary policy in his 
prepared remarks.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific, Pilots Will Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- One day ahead of Cathay Pacific Airways'  
deadline for pilots to either take a pay cut or leave the company, 
the two sides met privately to try to resolve the dispute that 
already has grounded hundreds of flights and could deteriorate into 
a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay bosses and representatives of the Hong Kong Aircrew  
Officers Association met for 11 hours in a session that began 
Wednesday and ended early Thursday. They declined public comment 
but have agreed to keep talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, pilots kept phoning in sick en masse, saying the  
company's layoff threats have left them too stressed out to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay canceled 75 of its 119 flights on Thursday, but said it  
had hired other airlines to fly 46 of the services on a charter 
basis to keep as many passengers as possible in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay and the pilots have agreed to a news blackout until the  
negotiations end, the general secretary of the pilots union, John 
Findlay, said by telephone Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too soon to say whether any progress could be made, said  
Cathay spokeswoman Katherine Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is demanding that the pilots take pay cuts averaging 7  
percent over two years in exchange for stock options, as the Hong 
Kong carrier tries to slash costs and return to profitability. 
Cathay last year suffered its first full-year loss in 35 years as 
the Asian economic crisis and Hong Kong's recession hurt the demand 
for air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots have said they will take a strike vote if anyone is  
fired in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 85,000 passengers have been affected since Cathay gave  
the pilots their ultimatum on May 28.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Assembly OKs School Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Assembly on Thursday passed a  
bill that would require all public school students to recite the 
``all men are created equal'' passage of the Declaration of 
Independence every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The lines would be recited along with the Pledge of Allegiance.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed 50-16 and goes next to the Senate. A  
spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman said she is undecided about the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoolchildren would recite: ``We hold these truths to be  
self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed 
by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure 
these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their 
just powers from the consent of the governed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These two sentences are the basis of everything that America  
has become,'' said Republican Assemblyman Michael Carroll, the 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who objected said the Declaration of Independence  
reflects colonial values that excluded minorities and women. And 
some suggested changing ``all men'' to ``all people.''

<HEADLINE> United 3, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richie Williams had a goal and an assist as  
D.C. United beat the Miami Fusion 3-1 Thursday night in Major 
League Soccer, extending its winning streak to six. 
</P>
<P>
	By handing the Fusion its seventh loss in eight games, the  
first-place United pulled eight points ahead of Columbus in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter, who scored his league-leading 12th goal, and Ben  
Olsen had first-half goals for D.C (9-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gutierrez scored for the Fusion (4-10), which fell to 0-7  
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter gave D.C. the lead in the eighth minute, extending his  
point-scoring streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Aunger, in the middle of the penalty area, flicked a  
header that Lassiter tapped past goalkeeper Jeff Cassar from five 
yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	United outshot Miami 10-4 in the first half, and eight of those  
shots came during a 14-minute stretch that produced Olsen's goal 
and a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 32nd minute, Olsen made a run down the center of the  
penalty area, where he accepted Williams' neatly threaded pass. 
Olsen's right-footed shot glanced off Miami's John Maessner and 
slipped inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made it 3-0 in the 58th minute on a fallaway shot from  
the top of the goalie box, depositing the ball into the upper left 
corner past Garth Lagerway, who replaced Cassar at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez scored on a diving header in the 69th minute.  
</P>
<P>
	D.C. played without midfielder Marco Etcheverry, serving a  
one-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton, playing in his second game with the Fusion since he was  
acquired June 1, had an assist in his 100th MLS game, the first 
international player to reach that milestone in the league's 
four-year history.

<HEADLINE> Globalstar Satellites Put in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Four satellites were successfully  
put into orbit today, the latest additions to the 
multibillion-dollar Globalstar communications network. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites -- worth about $15 million each -- separated in  
pairs about an hour after the Boeing rocket carrying them was 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Jose, Calif.-based Globalstar plans to begin providing  
wireless telephone service beginning this fall. Among the regions 
to receive initial service: parts of the United States, Europe, 
South America and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The first four satellites in the $3.3 billion Globalstar network  
were launched by Boeing in February 1998. Seven months later, 12 
Globalstar satellites were destroyed shortly after liftoff when the 
Ukrainian Zenit rocket carrying them failed. Part of the wreckage 
fell onto Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's last launch, in early May, ended with the satellite  
stranded in the wrong orbit. An investigation continues into the 
failure of that Delta III, a larger and upgraded version of the 
rocket launched today. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, 48 satellites are planned for the Globalstar  
constellation. Boeing Delta II rockets, as well as Russian Soyuz 
rockets, will be used to launch the remaining satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's launch was valued at about $115 million, including the  
cost of the satellites and the Delta II rocket. It was delayed two 
days by bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globalstar consortium of 12 companies was founded by Loral  
Space and Communications Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.

<HEADLINE> 3 Guilty of Laundering Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three Mexican businessmen were convicted  
Thursday of laundering tens of millions of dollars for a Colombian 
drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others were acquitted in the case, which accused 40  
Mexican and Venezuelan businessmen and bankers of helping drug 
cartel members launder their money. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests were part of a three-year U.S. Customs sting that  
spanned several countries. The operation raised tensions between 
the United States and Mexico, which was kept in the dark about the 
investigation into its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents arrested 167 people, including top Mexican bankers and  
executives, in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
	Convicted of conspiracy and money laundering on Thursday were  
Jose Reyes Ortega Gonzales, a former manager of banking operations 
for Bancomer in Tepatitlan, Mexico; Manuel Barraza Leon, a Bancomer 
branch manager in Tijuana; and Alfonso Labrada Gurrola, who worked 
at a Tijuana law firm that represented banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquitted were Javier Alcala Navarro; Katy Kissel Belfer, a  
broker at CBI International Securities in Mexico City; and Fernando 
Barragan Reyes, a stock broker. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. customs officials seized $100 million from 14 banks and  
dozens of individuals who were accused of laundering money for the 
Cali drug cartel in Colombia, and the Juarez cartel in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico accused the United States of intruding on Mexican  
sovereignty by conducting a sting without its involvement. Two of 
the largest banks pleaded guilty in March to money laundering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, seven defendants were indicted for laundering money  
for the Cali cartel and pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy or 
drug trafficking. Their sentences were pending. Others are awaiting 
trial.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Learn To Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They were going down together. That was supposed to be the one  
sure thing in this wackier-by-the-minute New York tale of 
double-dealing, frayed nerves and dubious redemption. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Van Gundy and Patrick Ewing, the long-suffering coach and  
his longer-suffering star, stuck by each other so fiercely for so 
long it seemed like a given: Whatever happened to one, happened to 
the other. Throughout the season, they kept insisting their fates 
were bound together tighter than the braids on Latrell Sprewell's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	And so right after the ``pop'' of Ewing's Achilles' tendon in  
Game 2, you cocked an ear expecting two sounds next. The first was 
the ``thud'' of the Knicks falling on their faces and out of the 
Eastern Conference finals. The second was the ``click'' of the lock 
on Van Gundy's office as he headed out of town, a pink slip signed 
by Madison Square Garden boss Dave Checketts in his fist. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, what you heard when Van Gundy walked into the postgame  
news conference Wednesday night after Game 5 was a primal scream. 
It came from the back of the room, from a very large man whose 
smile was nearly as broad as he is tall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, Patrick,'' Van Gundy said, his own smile  
uncharacteristically wide. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days ago, Van Gundy found out just how ready Checketts  
keeps his pad of pink slips. After first denying it, his boss owned 
up to interviewing Van Gundy's archrival, former Bulls coach Phil 
Jackson, as a possible successor. Now, with one more Knicks' win, a 
clause in Van Gundy's contract kicks in, guaranteeing him one more 
year on the job at $3.5 million. He can haunt Checketts' office 
whenever the mood strikes him. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks leading the series 3-2 and one home win shy of  
history and a shot at the championship, the catch phrase being used 
to sum up the achievement is this: No eighth-seeded team has ever 
made it to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't tell the half of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Looking at their roster when the season began, the Knicks were  
much better than an eighth-place team, especially in the 
post-Michael Jordan era. But what seemed improbable then -- and 
almost impossible the moment Ewing announced he was done for the 
season -- is that they would be this good this soon. 
</P>
<P>
	When general manager Ernie Grunfeld imported Sprewell and Marcus  
Camby, he was trying to anticipate the day Ewing tired of carrying 
the team on his back. But the star and his loyal-to-a-fault coach 
hadn't asked for help, and they weren't too eager to have it 
foisted on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, for Sprewell, Camby and Allan Houston to contribute,  
the Knicks had to play an up-tempo game. And after 14 seasons in 
New York -- a service record unmatched in Knicks history -- the only 
thing Ewing does fast anymore is slap icebags on his chronic 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Knicks fell to 21-21, two spots out of the last playoff  
spot in the East, Checketts took Grunfeld to dinner and told him he 
was no longer in charge. As sometimes happens, the players made 
order out of the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	That usually happens right after a coach or manager gets fired,  
but the effect rarely lasts very long. The Knicks, though, went 6-2 
the rest of the way. Just when it seemed as though they would never 
learn to share, they did. They won a crucial game in Miami without 
Ewing, then started the playoff run that puts them back in the 
Garden on Friday with a chance to leave Indiana behind like a bad 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's future -- Sprewell, Camby and Houston -- learned first  
to make peace with the past -- Ewing -- and then how to play without 
him. The discoveries have been exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the mood in the locker room is a curious one. For all  
the success, the Knicks know how tenuous Van Gundy's grasp on the 
job remains -- so much so that he's become a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early in the season, we were selling ourselves short and  
selling Jeff short,'' Houston said. ``But the things we're doing, 
he was talking about then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Johnson, who has inherited some of the dirty work under  
the basket in Ewing's absence and has had to give up playing time 
to Sprewell, has even taken to admonishing people who ask about Van 
Gundy's chances of sticking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one of only three teams with a chance to win a  
championship and he's up 3-2? C'mon,'' Johnson said. ``C'mon. 
C'mon.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Delays Mideast Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday  
postponed a trip to the Middle East while Israel struggles to form 
a new government. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department advised Mrs. Clinton against the trip once  
it became clear in recent days that Israeli Prime Minister-elect 
Ehud Barak was having problems forming a government, an official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip was to include stops in Israel, Jordan and Yemen for  
the so-called ``Emerging Democracy Conference'' there, and meetings 
with the Palestinian Authority. Mrs. Clinton's office said the trip 
will be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	She was to make the trip after accompanying President Clinton to  
a summit meeting of seven industrial powers plus Russia in Germany, 
which ends June 20. That part of her trip remains unchanged. She 
also plans stops in Italy and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not unusual for high profile trips to be delayed because  
of political sensitivities. President Clinton postponed an early 
1998 trip to South Asia because it would have coincided with an 
election campaign in India. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department official said the diplomatic advice to Mrs.  
Clinton is not a sign the United States has lost confidence that 
Barak can form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	Her trip to the Middle East originally was scheduled for March  
but was postponed then, as well, so as not to disturb the pending 
Israeli elections or Jordan's mourning of King Hussein's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton caused a stir a year ago when she went beyond U.S.  
policy in advocating a Palestinian state. The official U.S. 
position is that the issue of whether to create such a state should 
be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Tests TV's Fairness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was standard first lady fare -- Hillary Rodham  
Clinton collecting instruments for charity during an appearance on 
the ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that she's inched closer to a Senate candidacy, such  
feel-good exposure may have political benefits. TV executives face 
a balancing act between coverage of the first lady and their 
practices to ensure fairness for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lot of uncharted territory,'' said Jay Severin, a  
Republican political consultant. ``We've never had a first lady 
who's run for political office before. This is the first of many 
questions: Is this right? Is this fair? Is this appropriate?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the charity work, Mrs. Clinton was briefly  
interviewed Thursday by Katie Couric of ``Today.'' The first lady's 
appearance was organized through Save the Music, a charity started 
by the cable network VH1 to distribute recycled musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outside the show's storefront studio in Rockefeller  
Center, she made small talk with the tourists who come to watch the 
show each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is beautiful. Is this yours?'' she asked a woman who was  
donating her grandmother's violin. Mrs. Clinton said she had 
already donated one of her husband's saxophones. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of fairness, ``Today'' executive producer Jeff Zucker said  
that he had unsuccessfully sought to have New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani appear this week on the show. Giuliani, a 
Republican, is considered a possible opponent if Mrs. Clinton runs 
for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that she's a potential candidate, you do have to think of  
things like this,'' he said, ``and we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zucker said if Mrs. Clinton appears on ``Today'' again, it will  
be in a political interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at ABC briefly talked about the impact on a  
prospective campaign when ``Good Morning America'' was invited to 
televise a town meeting on teen violence from the White House two 
weeks ago with President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The importance of the issue in the wake of the Colorado school  
massacre outweighed the political considerations, ABC News 
President David Westin said. Future decisions will be made on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, one of the factors we will take into account is if  
it is more a matter of image in a political race or if it's 
newsworthy,'' he said. ``If it's newsworthy, we have to cover it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal equal time provisions, which ensure broadcasters give  
fair exposure to candidates, didn't apply to Mrs. Clinton's 
``Today'' appearance on Thursday for three reasons, said Andrew 
Schwartzman, president of the Washington-based Media Access 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules don't kick in until a person is a declared candidate.  
Even if Mrs. Clinton had declared, only other Democrats would be 
entitled to equal time until the party determines its nominee, 
Schwartzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NBC has a Federal Communications Commission  
exemption for the ``Today'' show that affects most political 
interviews, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is clearly benefiting from a journalistic  
honeymoon, said Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media 
and Public Affairs in Washington. In recent months, evening news 
shows have run 28 stories about her potential Senate candidacy and 
six stories about Vice President Gore's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think the morning news shows would act more like  
journalism instead of entertainment puff shows,'' Lichter said.

<HEADLINE> McHale, Thompson: Hall of Fame? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin McHale, who was a key member of  
the Boston Celtics in the early 1980s, and retired Georgetown coach 
John Thompson were among 13 nominated today as candidates for 
basketball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others who played for a time with the Celtics -- Dennis  
Johnson, Jo Jo White and Wayne Embry -- were also nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale played 12 seasons with the Celtics and was part of a  
frontcourt with Robert Parish and Larry Bird. The team won NBA 
championships in 1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-10, McHale used agility, long arms, and his array of  
moves to shoot over even taller defenders. He averaged 18 points 
per game for his career. But McHale was also picked three times to 
the NBA's Defensive Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who retired from Georgetown this year, coached the  
team to its 1984 national championship and 14 straight NCAA 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other nominees this year are: Bob McAdoo, a two-time NBA  
champion with Los Angeles; Maurice Cheeks of the 1983 NBA 
championship team in Philadelphia; Dennis Johnson, who took a total 
of three championship rings with Boston and Seattle; Gus Johnson of 
the Baltimore Bullets, who died of a brain tumor in 1987; Sidney 
Moncrief of the Milwaukee Bucks; 1967 NBA ring-holder Chet Walker 
of Philadelphia; and White, who played with two championship Celtic 
teams and captured an Olympic gold medal with the U.S. team in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The nominees also include Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan,  
whose 800-442 record gave him more victories than any other active 
college coach; Tex Winter, an assistant Chicago Bulls coach who has 
spent 52 seasons at Div. 1 college and NBA teams -- more than any 
active coach; Morgan Wootten, the coach at DeMatha High School in 
Washington, D.C., whose record of 1,185-178 is the best ever for a 
high school coach; and Embry, who took an NBA championship with the 
Celtics in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the election will be announced June 21.

<HEADLINE> Belle, O's Mgr. in Shouting Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Sullen slugger Albert Belle faced possible  
disciplinary measures by the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday after 
engaging in a shouting match with manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Belle yelled at Miller and had to be restrained  
by teammates after being removed from Wednesday night's 4-2 win 
over the Florida Marlins in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like that happen on the bench or in the clubhouse,  
those are the type things we deal with internally,'' Orioles 
general manager Frank Wren said in Atlanta, where the Orioles had 
an off-day before a weekend series with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a five-year, $65 million free-agent deal with  
the Orioles in December, has been suspended six times during his 
career and is well-known for his disdain of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear what, if any, disciplinary measures would be  
taken against Belle. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was said and what was done is an internal matter,'' Wren  
said, adding that Miller ``isn't going to say anymore about it, 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller could not be reached for comment Thursday. A call to his  
Atlanta hotel room was answered by an unidentified person, who hung 
up when the reporter identified himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred in the top of the ninth inning in the  
Orioles dugout after Belle, who went 0-for-5 in the game, failed to 
run out a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
	With two runners on and two outs in the ninth and the Orioles  
leading 4-2, Belle grounded to Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell. 
Belle slowed up halfway to first, but Lowell's throw pulled first 
baseman Kevin Millar off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller replaced Belle in the outfield with Rich Amaral on a  
double switch, a move he said he had planned to make before Belle's 
groundout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amaral knew he was going in if Albert made the last out when  
the inning started,'' Miller said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was unaware of the move until he was on his way to his  
outfield position, eventually jogging back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout, TV cameras caught an exchange of expletives  
between Miller and Belle. Belle yelled angrily at Miller and was 
restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. Miller waved Belle off with a 
toss of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My comment is that what happens internally will stay internal  
and will be taken care of internally,'' Miller said. ``What goes on 
between me and anybody stays in the clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, approached by reporters after the game, responded with a  
stream of expletives. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, struggling with a .244 batting average, has hit only one  
home run in his last 21 games. The Orioles, with a $78.5 million 
payroll, are the most disappointing team in baseball with a 22-36 
record and there has been speculation that Miller's job is in 
jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Public TV Airs Gay Awareness Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A teacher asks a fourth-grader what being  
gay means. The confused boy explains haltingly that it has 
something to do with black people marrying white people. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what words they thought of to describe gay people, the  
class suggests ``pervert,'' ``weird,'' ``funny,'' ``fancy,'' 
``sick'' and ``gross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a first-grader volunteers that she knows two gay men.  
They live in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids are absorbing information. Some of it's accurate and some  
of it's really off the wall,'' said filmmaker Debra Chasnoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Her documentary, ``It's Elementary,'' began airing on dozens of  
public television stations this month despite having been turned 
down by the national PBS organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative groups have long complained about the film, which  
has been shown at teacher-training seminars, parent-teacher 
association meetings, and churches and synogogues since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Family Association, a conservative Christian group  
based in Biloxi, Miss., has urged its members to protest the 
broadcast. It and other groups have suggested PBS stations air a 
rebuttal video, ``Suffer the Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't commend a destructive activity to someone just to  
make them feel better. That's what ``It's Elementary'' does,'' said 
David Miller of the AFA. At least one major PBS station, KCTS in 
Seattle, agreed to put the rebuttal on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Elementary,'' filmed in classrooms in San Francisco; New  
York; Cambridge, Mass.; and Madison, Wis., eavesdrops on 
teacher-student discussions about stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 89 of the country's 347 public television stations plan  
to run ``It's Elementary,'' Chasnoff said. At least 80 have turned 
it down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After national PBS executives rejected the documentary, KQED-TV  
in San Francisco helped Chasnoff get American Public Television to 
distribute it, with financial support from the Ford Foundation, the 
Streisand Foundation and James C. Hormel, whom President Clinton 
appointed last week as the nation's first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	WNET in New York broadcast it last Thursday, drawing about  
172,000 viewers, an average prime-time audience, said station 
executive Stella Giammasi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of nasty calls before we aired this program from  
what seemed like a pressure group,'' Giammasi said. Afterward, he 
said, the station received 19 responses from viewers, eight 
negative and 11 positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasnoff, a lesbian who has two sons ages 10 and 5, said she  
made the film to inspire parents and teachers to try to raise 
children's sensitivity to gay issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to see if we could make a film to open up the  
public dialogue ... and encourage adults to rethink their 
assumptions,'' she said from her San Francisco office. ``To say 
it's not OK to have negative stereotypes about gay people. Gay 
people exist and should be treated respectfully like everyone 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she is considering a lawsuit over the rebuttal video  
since ``Suffer the Children'' uses much of her documentary without 
permission.

<HEADLINE> Price, Norman Head St. Jude Field  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Tiger Woods aside, it's difficult to  
imagine a more accomplished -- or more traveled -- 19-year-old golfer 
than Sergio Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard has played tournaments in 20 countries, including  
such golfing outposts as Qatar, Chile and Slovenia. He won the 
European Amateur as a 15-year-old, captured the British Amateur 
last year and this year was the first European to be low amateur at 
the Masters. In his U.S. pro debut, he finished third at last 
month's Byron Nelson Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after an 11th-place finish at last week's Memorial  
Tournament, Garcia has his sights on the St. Jude Classic, which 
starts today. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot, humid weather suits Garcia, as does the player-friendly  
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable,'' Garcia said after finishing a  
late-afternoon pro-amateur round. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't taken Garcia long to get used to the questions and  
comparisons to Woods, who he calls a good friend. They talked a bit 
at the Memorial, which Woods won. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just told me I was handling (the attention) OK,'' Garcia  
said. ``Then we made some jokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he exudes maturity, Garcia remains boyish about golf. He  
plays because he enjoys it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to play golf. I have a lot of fun playing golf,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's chances of winning St. Jude are improved by the absence  
of Woods, David Duval, Vijay Singh and several other top players. 
They are skipping the event to prepare for next week's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But defending champion Nick Price and 1997 winner Greg Norman  
are here, joined by Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, Davis 
Love III, Tom Lehman and local favorite John Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, who was recovering from shoulder surgery and did not  
defend his St. Jude title last year, has played only six events 
this year. He is coming off a 69th-place finish at the Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman felt ``a little rusty'' last week, but said that was no  
excuse for his poor putting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm normally a fairly consistently good putter, even coming  
off a break,'' he said. ``I was shocked by the way I putted. I 
can't remember a week where I performed that poorly with the flat 
stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman knows he must putt much better this week if he is to be  
ready for the lightning-fast greens at Pinehurst Resort and Country 
Club in North Carolina, site of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Tournament Players Club at Southwind features  
softer greens that allow players to ``take dead aim'' at the pin, 
Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman called the greens ``perfect.''  
</P>
<P>
	``If you are hitting it anywhere near the hole, you're probably  
going to make a lot of putts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The par-71, 7,030-yard course features rolling terrain with 96  
bunkers and 10 water hazards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Price shot 16 under and won a one-hole playoff with  
Jeff Sluman. He was spectacular at the 528-yard 16th, eagling it 
three times and making birdie once. 
</P>
<P>
	Price expects 15- to 20-under will win the tournament this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``(The course) is in the best shape I've seen it in,'' said  
Price, who has two victories and six top-10 finishes in 12 St. Jude 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Norman, the 42-year-old Price has cut back on the number of  
PGA Tour events he plays. He has four top-10 finishes in nine 
tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having such a great time,'' he said. ``I'm on the back  
nine of my career now, but I don't know what hole I'm on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Jude's purse of $2.5 million is $700,000 larger than last  
year. The winner's share is $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is sponsored by FedEx.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Stresses Tolerance in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIEDLCE, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II paid tribute Thursday  
to Catholics slain for resisting conversion under the Russian czar 
and to Jews sent to Nazi death camps ``from this martyred Polish 
soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also reached out to Orthodox Christians, preaching a  
message of tolerance in eastern Poland, a region that has suffered 
war and religious conflict. And as the sun set, he welcomed Muslims 
attending a multifaith prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian unity and religious pluralism are major themes of John  
Paul's 13-day pilgrimage to his homeland, which reached the halfway 
point Thursday with the 79-year-old pope drawing huge crowds of 
faithful from across eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared to be bearing up well after a day of rest, though  
his speech was slurred -- a possible symptom of Parkinson's disease. 
But the pope sang prayers and switched languages easily to greet 
people from former Soviet territories in their native tongues. 
</P>
<P>
	At his first stop in Siedlce, midway between Warsaw and the  
border with Belarus, John Paul shared a stage with bishops from 
Belarus, Kazakstan, Russia and Ukraine to celebrate Mass before 
400,000 faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Roman Catholics and Eastern rite Catholics were in  
the crowd as the pontiff urged people to follow the example of 13 
Catholic martyrs slain in Pratulin in 1874 for resisting conversion 
to Orthodox Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	``These simple people, fathers of families, chose at the  
critical moment to suffer death rather than yield to pressure in a 
way untrue to their conscience,'' John Paul said. ```How sweet it 
is to die for the faith.' These were their last words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such devotion was needed today, he said, citing ``problems and  
violent changes'' facing humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``In such a world, many people, especially the young, feel lost  
and wounded,'' he said. ``Some fall victim to sects and travesties 
of religion, or to manipulations of the truth. Others succumb to 
different forms of slavery. Attitudes of selfishness, injustice and 
insensitivity to the needs of others becomes more widespread.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in remarks not in his prepared text, he said: ``On this  
martyred Polish soil, I cannot fail to mention the martyrdom of the 
Jewish nation ... in Siedlce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 12,000 Jews -- the city's entire Jewish population --  
were deported by the Nazis to the Treblinka death camp and slain. 
On Friday, the pope plans to further honor Jewish victims of the 
Holocaust during a stop at the Umschlagplatz monument in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern rite Catholics follow an Orthodox-style liturgy but are  
loyal to the pope instead of Orthodox Christian patriarchs. Banners 
and flags in the crowd were from Belarus, Ukraine and even Siberia 
and the Urals region in eastern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul later traveled north across the Bug river to  
Drohiczyn, an Orthodox Christian stronghold, for a service on 
Christian unity. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox Christian Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have  
been separated since the Great Schism in 1054 in a dispute over 
papal authority and interpretation of their creed. The Vatican 
believes John Paul's visit last month to Romania, a predominantly 
Orthodox country, was a major turn for better relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before a huge cross with a crack down the middle, John

<HEADLINE>  Pope Stresses Tolerance in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIEDLCE, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II paid tribute Thursday  
to Catholics slain for resisting conversion under the Russian czar 
and to Jews sent to Nazi death camps ``from this martyred Polish 
soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pontiff also reached out to Orthodox Christians, preaching a  
message of tolerance in eastern Poland, a region that has suffered 
war and religious conflict. And as the sun set, he welcomed Muslims 
attending a multifaith prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian unity and religious pluralism are major themes of John  
Paul's 13-day pilgrimage to his homeland, which reached the halfway 
point Thursday with the 79-year-old pope drawing huge crowds of 
faithful from across eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared to be bearing up well after a day of rest, though  
his speech was slurred -- a possible symptom of Parkinson's disease. 
But the pope sang prayers and switched languages easily to greet 
people from former Soviet territories in their native tongues. 
</P>
<P>
	At his first stop in Siedlce, midway between Warsaw and the  
border with Belarus, John Paul shared a stage with bishops from 
Belarus, Kazakstan, Russia and Ukraine to celebrate Mass before 
400,000 faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Roman Catholics and Eastern rite Catholics were in  
the crowd as the pontiff urged people to follow the example of 13 
Catholic martyrs slain in Pratulin in 1874 for resisting conversion 
to Orthodox Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	``These simple people, fathers of families, chose at the  
critical moment to suffer death rather than yield to pressure in a 
way untrue to their conscience,'' John Paul said. ```How sweet it 
is to die for the faith.' These were their last words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such devotion was needed today, he said, citing ``problems and  
violent changes'' facing humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``In such a world, many people, especially the young, feel lost  
and wounded,'' he said. ``Some fall victim to sects and travesties 
of religion, or to manipulations of the truth. Others succumb to 
different forms of slavery. Attitudes of selfishness, injustice and 
insensitivity to the needs of others becomes more widespread.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in remarks not in his prepared text, he said: ``On this  
martyred Polish soil, I cannot fail to mention the martyrdom of the 
Jewish nation ... in Siedlce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 12,000 Jews -- the city's entire Jewish population --  
were deported by the Nazis to the Treblinka death camp and slain. 
On Friday, the pope plans to further honor Jewish victims of the 
Holocaust during a stop at the Umschlagplatz monument in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern rite Catholics follow an Orthodox-style liturgy but are  
loyal to the pope instead of Orthodox Christian patriarchs. Banners 
and flags in the crowd were from Belarus, Ukraine and even Siberia 
and the Urals region in eastern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul later traveled north across the Bug river to  
Drohiczyn, an Orthodox Christian stronghold, for a service on 
Christian unity. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox Christian Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have  
been separated since the Great Schism in 1054 in a dispute over 
papal authority and interpretation of their creed. The Vatican 
believes John Paul's visit last month to Romania, a predominantly 
Orthodox country, was a major turn for better relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before a huge cross with a crack down the middle, John  
Paul told the crowd of 150,000 that included thousands of Orthodox 
Christians that Christ ``founded a single Church and wants the 
Church to remain forever united.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Therefore, at the threshold of a new period of history, we  
must all examine our consciences regarding responsibility for the 
present divisions,'' he said. ``We must admit the faults committed 
and pardon each other in turn. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``On the eve of the third millenium, we must move more quickly  
towards full and fraternal reconciliation.''

work in traditional Orthodox areas since the fall of communism in

<HEADLINE> Selig: Royals Ownership Votes Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Baseball owners are not likely to act on Miles  
Prentice's bid to buy the Kansas City Royals at their September 
meeting, commissioner Bud Selig said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, who has put together a group of more than 40 investors  
to buy the team for $75 million, met for almost three hours with 
the ownership committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice reached his agreement with the team last Nov. 13. He  
and Royals president Mike Herman had been hopeful of getting 
approval of the owners in September, which Selig said was ``a 
possibility but not likely.'' The owners' next scheduled meeting 
after that is in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purchase of a baseball team is a unique process,'' Selig  
said. ``We've had other large groups. Every one of these has its 
own indigenous characteristics, which makes it difficult to assess 
and compare one to another. They made a very good presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said the size of Prentice's group was ``not a particular  
concern,'' but was evasive when asked if the group's finances 
worried the committee. Baseball officials have expressed concern 
about whether the group has enough money to successfully operate 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to comment on the specifics,'' Selig said. ``We  
have a lot of information to digest, some of which was new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Selig had met previously with Prentice, Herman and Royals  
chairman David Glass, this was the first time information on the 
sale was given to the full ownership committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very confident we will have baseball in Kansas City and  
Miles Prentice will be the owner,'' Herman said. ``That's how I 
feel. Ask commissioner Selig how he feels. I'm not uncomfortable 
with this process because we've been there before. These are 
honorable men and it gets done at a pace they dictate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, 56, a Vermont native who made his fortune as a lawyer  
in New York, characterized the meetings as ``a very positive 
exchange, a good dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic. I've always remained optimistic because I  
believe in the integrity of the process,'' Prentice said. ``The way 
things have gone to date, I've never had any bad feelings at all. 
Both sides asked questions they wanted to ask and received the 
answers they wanted to get on the table. I think they were happy 
with them. I can't say any more than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said the sale ``was too early in the process'' to  
determine when the sale will be in the form he will bring to an 
approval vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be an ongoing exchange of information,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Killer Riding the Rails in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEIMAR, Texas (AP) -- In earlier times, the railway running  
through this town meant progress. The founder of the feed store, 
for example, made his fortune after jumping off a freight train to 
find work. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, though, the train whistle has become a sinister sound.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past month, three people have been bludgeoned to death in  
their homes here, apparently by a killer who is riding the rails. 
</P>
<P>
	The crimes were identical -- a break-in in the dark, a beating,  
valuables missing. Behind the houses, yards away, lay railroad 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first killings in these parts that even the  
old-timers can recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The train used to be a good sound,'' says Charles Herzik, who  
has lived all his 60 years in Weimar, a ranching community of 2,000 
people 80 miles west of Houston. ``Now it makes you feel scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herzik manages the M-G Farm Service Center, a general store  
offering everything from potting soil to shotguns. In the past few 
weeks, he has sold more firepower than during all of hunting 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody you talk to is scared,'' he says. ``People have  
never seen anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say at least two killings in the Houston area and  
one in Lexington, Ky., may be linked to those here. The victims 
were all beaten to death, and the crimes occurred near railroad 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	This week law officers from Texas and Kentucky, along with the  
FBI and railroad officials, formed a task force to intensify the 
hunt for the man suspected in all six slayings: 39-year-old Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez, a drifter from Mexico with a record of weapons 
and burglary charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for a fugitive that possibly does not have any  
set roots in one location,'' says Don Clark, head of the FBI's 
Houston office. ``That's the biggest thing that we know right now, 
is that this person is probably in a constant transient status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect first was linked to the Dec. 17, 1998, slaying of  
Dr. Claudia Benton at her home in West University Place, a 
well-to-do community of professionals that is surrounded by the 
city of Houston. The 39-year-old physician had been sexually 
assaulted, stabbed and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprints were found inside her  
home, which is about 100 yards from the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA from the crime scene has been linked to evidence in the  
slayings of the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, 
Karen, 47, in the parsonage behind Weimar United Church of Christ. 
They were beaten to death with a sledgehammer and were found May 2 
after they failed to show up for Sunday services. The railroad 
tracks run behind the garden where Mrs. Sirnic grew sunflowers and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sirnics' pickup truck and Ms. Benton's vehicle were later  
found abandoned in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last Friday, only days after the yellow police tape had  
been removed from the Sirnics' home, 73-year-old Josephine Konvicka 
was found beaten to death in the tiny farmhouse where she had lived 
all her life. It is three miles from the parsonage and, again, only 
yards from the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprints were found inside.  
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the body of 26-year-old Noemi Dominguez was found  
in her Houston home. She died of a blow to the head, and her car 
had been stolen. Resendez-Ramirez is considered the prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is being sought for questioning in the 1997 slaying of  
Christopher Maier, 21, a University of Kentucky student who was 
struck in the back of the head as he and his girlfriend took a 
shortcut along some tracks in Lexington on their way from one party 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A $60,000 reward has been posted for information leading to  
Resendez-Ramirez's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major-league fear out here,'' says Darius Brisco, Mrs.  
Konvicka's son-in-law. ``I don't think you can buy a handgun out 
here. The reality is the ugliness of the big city has struck rural 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The freight railroads have stepped up security, watching for  
drifters hopping trains. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force was in action Thursday, stopping and searching  
freight trains rolling through the town of Flatonia, about 75 miles 
east of San Antonio. Flatonia is a major intersection of east-west 
and north-south rails. 
</P>
<P>
	Weimar Mayor Bennie Kosler, who used to brag about his  
community's hospitality, now urges townspeople to get home before 
dark, lock the doors and windows they used to leave open and turn 
on all their lights. His 19-year-old granddaughter has taken to 
sleeping in her parents' bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weimar was always known as a nice little friendly town, where  
your neighbor knows more about you than you know about yourself. 
There weren't any robberies, there wasn't any crime,'' Kosler says. 
``This animal has taken that privilege away from us, and that was a 
very good feeling at one time.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Nazi Renounces Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York man accused of hiding a past as a  
guard at Nazi slave labor camps left the United States and 
renounced his citizenship, the Justice Department announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is abandoning a lawsuit filed a year ago against  
Dmytro Sawchuk, 74, of Glen Spey, because he went to the U.S. 
consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, in March and surrendered his U.S. 
passport and naturalization certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the federal court case in New York, Sawchuk was accused of  
concealing from U.S. authorities his having served at an SS-run 
training camp in Poland in 1943 and as an armed guard at two slave 
labor camps for Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint also said he guarded Jewish prisoners who were  
forced to exhume and burn the corpses of hundreds of thousands of 
Jews who were murdered at a death camp in Belzec, Poland, in 1942.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Aid Chief Atwood To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- J. Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S.  
foreign aid agency, announced Thursday he will leave his post July 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently his duties as administrator of the Agency for  
International Development also have included directing relief 
operations for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton had nominated Atwood to be ambassador to  
Brazil. However, Atwood withdrew his name from consideration last 
month because opposition by Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., precluded his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood will join the Boston-based Citizens Energy Corp., headed  
by its founder, former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, D-Mass. The 
corporation consists of for-profit ventures that support a wide 
array of social and charitable programs in the United States and 
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Gene Map May Be Completed by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal project to map the human genetic  
pattern could be complete by 2002, a year earlier than predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers around the world trying to catalog all of the 60,000  
to 90,000 genes in human DNA are making rapid progress that could 
bump up the completion date, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the 
National Human Genome Research Institute, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Identifying all human genes will make it possible to treat or  
prevent cancer, inherited disorders and some diseases, experts say. 
Once genes are located, researchers can determine what proteins 
they make and use that knowledge to correct problems caused by 
mutated or inherited genes. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal project is competing with a privately funded effort  
by Rockville, Md.-based Celera Genomics, scheduled for completion 
by the end of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Genes discovered by private enterprise could be reserved briefly  
for exclusive use. Genes discovered by the federal researchers are 
released immediately into the public domain.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Up; Corn, Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures advanced Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced after heavy rains fell in winter wheat growing  
areas, further delaying harvesting of mature crops and leaving them 
more vulnerable to disease and pests. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans retreated amid forecasts for timely rains to  
relieve young crops that have baked under above-normal temperatures 
in the Midwest for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 4 3/4 cents to $2.59 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.20 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to 
$1.24 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 2 1/2 cents to $4.69 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
amid concern about a large amount of slaughter-ready hogs at a time 
when supermarkets already have secured ample supplies for the 
summer. Beef futures also finished mostly lower.

<P>
	August live cattle fell .17 cent to 66.15 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .05 cent to 77.32 cents a pound; July lean hogs

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO suspended its 78-day air war  
against Yugoslavia Thursday after Serb troops left Kosovo in trucks 
armored cars and buses. Despite the death and destruction wreaked 
by the bombing campaign and the imminent arrival of a huge foreign 
force on Yugoslav soil, President Slobodan Milosevic proclaimed 
victory. ``The people are the heroes,'' he said on national

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Thursday all but called  
for an uprising against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. He 
told Serbs they had needlessly suffered airstrikes because their 
leader was determined ``to eliminate Kosovar Albanians from Kosovo, 
dead or alive.'' ``But we are ready to provide humanitarian aid now 
and to help to build a better future for Serbia, too, when its 
government represents tolerance and freedom, not repression and 
terror,'' Clinton added.

computer files. Anti-virus teams in the government and at 
universities were trying to determine the severity of the outbreak 
of ``Worm.Explore.Zip.'' General Electric temporarily shut down its

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to curb children's access to  
explicit sexual or violent movies, video games and other 
attractions of modern culture is caught in a House crossfire. The 
legislation, crafted as a response to the Colorado high school 
shootings in April, is designed to demonstrate that ``we are not 
impotent in the face of cultural pollution,'' said its author, Rep. 
Henry Hyde, R-Ill. It is expected to reach the House floor next 
week, as part of a broader debate that also will extend to gun

beating Buffalo 4-2 Thursday night to even the Stanley Cup series 
at a game apiece. Hull, one of the NHL's top scorers for years but 
absent from the Stanley Cup finals since his rookie year in 1986, 
beat Dominik Hasek with a wicked slap shot from above the right 
circle dot. The goal capped a Dallas comeback that saw the heavily 
favored Stars contained by the Sabres' smothering defense for two 
periods, only to bury Buffalo with 19 shots in the final period.

	Serb Forces Begin Leaving Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes,  
Yugoslav army convoys began withdrawing from Kosovo today as part 
of a peace deal signed by Serbian and Western generals to end the 
Balkans conflict. About 150 trucks, other army vehicles and cars 
carrying soldiers crossed the northern border of Kosovo at Medare, 
Western reporters at the scene said. The Pentagon confirmed the 
withdrawal this morning, but said the pullout started more slowly 
than was expected. ``We know that one MUP (special police) unit has 
left. We'd like to see a lot more flow'' of troops across the 
border out of Kosovo, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.

	U.S. Troops Move Toward Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 4,000 heavily armed U.S. troops moved  
toward Kosovo today, ready to help keep the peace in the shattered 
Balkan province once a newly signed peace deal with Yugoslavia took 
effect, the Pentagon said. Nearly 2,000 Marines aboard ships in the 
Aegean Sea began moving ashore in Greece at about dawn local time 
before heading overland to Macedonia to spearhead the entry of U.S. 
forces into Kosovo. At the same time, 200 Army troops are to begin 
flying to Macedonia from U.S. bases in Germany. The initial 
contingent of U.S. peacekeepers, which will enter Kosovo after the 
first British forces go in, will have tanks and other heavy armor.

	Slow Indonesia Count Arouses Suspicion  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police tightened security around  
Jakarta today as a slow election vote count aroused anxiety that 
Indonesia's long tradition of vote-rigging is again plaguing the 
country. Election officials denied any improprieties, saying they 
have been swamped by the 113 million votes cast in 
Monday'parliamentary election, billed as the country's most 
democratic vote in 44 years. By today, unofficial results released 
to journalists show that 8.2 percent of the votes had been 
tabulated, a fraction of what had been promised.

	Brain Damage-Cancer Defense Linked  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Testicular cancer can lead to seizures, memory  
loss and dementia long before the cancer is detected, researchers 
reported today in the third study to link brain damage to an immune 
system attack on cancer. The brain damage apparently is caused not 
by the cancer itself, but by an overly aggressive attack by body's 
own immune system on a protein produced by tumors, the researchers 
said. In today's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers said 
men with testicular cancer and damage to one of the brain's 
emotional centers had a particular type of antibody in their blood.

	Russian Premier Warns Lawmakers  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin warned lawmakers  
today that he might threaten their jobs if they failed to approve a 
package of economic austerity bills. Stepashin said he might call a 
confidence vote in his new Cabinet. If lawmakers vote 
no-confidence, then President Boris Yeltsin could disband the lower 
house, the State Duma, and call new elections -- a prospect 
lawmakers want to avoid. Communist and hard-line lawmakers, fearing 
a backlash from the public, have been resisting quick action on a 
series of bills that would introduce new taxes.

	Pope Stresses Loyalty To Church  
</P>
<P>
	SIEDLCE, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II stressed loyalty to the  
church today and warned young people against falling victim to 
``travesties of religion, or to manipulations of the truth.'' At a 
Mass attended by thousands of Roman Catholics and Eastern rite 
Catholics from Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, the pontiff called for 
people to follow the example of 13 martyrs slain in Pratulin in 
1874 for resisting conversion to Orthodox Christianity. ```How 
sweet it is to die for the faith.' These were their last words,'' 
John Paul said.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his major league-leading 23rd  
home run, but the Colorado Rockies hit six homers and beat the 
Seattle Mariners 16-11 in a game delayed more than three hours by 
rain last night. Play was stopped for 3 hours, 18 minutes after 
Seattle scored three runs in the top of the seventh to cut 
Colorado's lead to 11-10. The teams combined for 10 home runs.

<HEADLINE> Conviction Overturned in Cosby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Autumn Jackson, imprisoned for allegedly trying  
to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby by threatening to tell the 
tabloids she was his illegitimate daughter, could soon be free on 
bail after a federal appeals court overturned her conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson, 24, was sentenced in 1997 to two years and two  
months in prison after she was convicted of extortion, conspiracy 
and crossing state lines to commit a crime. She has served just 
over half of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday ruled the  
trial judge improperly instructed the jury on the law of extortion. 
The court also overturned the convictions of two accomplices for 
the same reason, ordering the case returned to the lower court for 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the appeals court said ``evidence at trial was plainly  
sufficient to support verdicts of guilty had the jury been properly 
instructed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the judge should have told jurors that in  
order to convict Ms. Jackson, they needed to find that she had 
wrongful intent. That would have allowed the jury to consider 
whether Ms. Jackson truly believed she was Cosby's daughter and 
therefore did not have any wrongful intent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her lawyers, Robert Baum, said he would ask for Ms.  
Jackson to be freed on bail as soon as today. Prosecutors indicated 
they would not oppose the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, said  
prosecutors hadn't decided whether to appeal the ruling. A lawyer 
for Cosby said the entertainer would support whatever decision they 
make. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Jackson demanded the money from Cosby on  
Jan. 16, 1997 -- the day Cosby's 27-year-old son, Ennis, was shot to 
death in a robbery while changing a flat tire on a Los Angeles 
highway. If Cosby failed to comply, she said, she would tell her 
story to the supermarket tabloids. The slaying of Cosby's son was 
unrelated to the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Ms. Jackson and Jose Medina were arrested in New  
York in an FBI sting after signing a $24 million payoff agreement 
with Cosby's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case tarnished Cosby's wholesome TV image as husband and  
father when he was forced to disclose that he had an affair with 
Ms. Jackson's mother, Shawn Upshaw, in the 1970s. He had provided 
her with more than $100,000 in support over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he repeatedly denied he is Ms. Jackson's father, telling  
jurors that he told Ms. Jackson: ``I will be for you a father 
figure, but I am not your father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of paternity was ruled irrelevant to the charges.  
Cosby took a paternity test after the trial to try to settle the 
dispute, but Ms. Jackson and her mother declined to take blood 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also overturned the case against Medina, who  
was sentenced to five years and three months in prison, and Boris 
Sabas, who got three months behind bars.

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade Bill Clears Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. trade with sub-Saharan Africa would  
increase dramatically under a bill that moved closer Thursday to a 
full House vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee approved, by voice vote, a  
measure designed to foster economic growth in the 48 sub-Saharan 
countries by reducing tariffs and encouraging investments in 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, also by voice vote, approved a separate bill to  
assist Caribbean and Central American countries suffering from the 
devastation last fall by Hurricanes Georges and Mitch. The bill 
extends to those countries the same low tariffs that Mexico and 
Canada have under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Both measures advanced to the full House.  
</P>
<P>
	The Africa trade bill would grant duty-free and quota-free  
treatment to textile and apparel imports from African countries and 
provide enhanced market access to African products for 10 years. 
The countries would have to act to establish market-driven 
economies and not engage in human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration strongly supports the bill, which  
many experts believe will lead to increased bilateral trade and 
investments with Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a similar version last year, shortly before  
President Clinton made the first presidential visit to sub-Saharan 
Africa in 20 years. But it faltered in the Senate, as lawmakers 
from textile-industry states warned that it could hurt American 
textile workers, among other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The textile industry also has raised objections to both  
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the Africa bill continued Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., expressed reservations about what he  
said was the bill's emphasis on supporting multinational corporate 
interests at the expense of broad-based economic and political 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the ranking Democratic member of the Senate subcommittee on  
Africa, I believe this is a critical issue and that we should be 
working to develop a bill that will be viable in both the House and 
Senate,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the legislation, which also is backed by the  
affected African nations, will help expand relations with a region 
that is teeming with a population of 700 million people but that 
accounts for just 2 percent of U.S. trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shifts our relationship with Africa from aid to trade,''  
said Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., a co-sponsor and Ways and Means 
Committee member. ``It's better for everyone to move forward to a 
profitable two-way, buy and sell business relationship that 
benefits everyone, than to maintain the status quo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to trade benefits, the Africa trade bill also  
protects against textile ``transshipment,'' in which a country will 
ship goods to the United States through another country that has 
access to tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Africa trade bill is H.R. 4343; the Caribbean/Central  
America bill is H.R. 984.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. OKs Kosovo Peacekeeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council voted today to  
authorize an international peacekeeping force to move into Kosovo 
to ensure the safe return of 860,000 ethnic Albanian refugees 
driven from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also calls for the United Nations to start  
rebuilding the province destroyed by war and NATO's 11-week bombing 
campaign, creating a civilian administration that would lay the 
groundwork for a future autonomous government. 
</P>
<P>
	It was approved 14-0 with China abstaining.  
</P>
<P>
	The council proceeded with the vote after NATO Secretary-General  
Javier Solana announced that Yugoslavia had sufficiently begun to 
withdraw its forces from Kosovo and that he had ordered the 11-week 
bombing campaign to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The first troops of the force, consisting of NATO members and  
other countries, could arrive in Kosovo by Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	China and Russia had refused to vote until NATO stopped bombing.  
</P>
<P>
	China had attempted to drastically reduce NATO's power to act  
militarily in Yugoslavia if necessary. That amendment was rejected 
by other council members, but another amendment referring to the 
authority of the council was incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	That satisfied Beijing's main concern, Deputy Ambassador Shen  
Guofang said in announcing after brief consultations this morning 
that he wouldn't block the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution formally caps a sequence of events that began  
Wednesday with the signing of a military agreement between NATO and 
Yugoslavia that called for Yugoslavia to withdraw its forces from 
Kosovo within 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution authorizes NATO and other countries to send in  
troops to Kosovo and use ``all necessary means'' to protect 
returning ethnic Albanians for an indefinite period. It asks the 
United Nations to establish an interim administration for the Serb 
province that would give its residents ``substantial autonomy'' 
from Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the council before the vote, Yugoslavia's U.N. envoy  
Vladislav Jovanovic said his country had succeeded in its two main 
goals -- ``successfully'' defending itself against NATO 
``aggression'' and keeping Kosovo part of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the indefinite mandate of the international force was  
unacceptable and a ``gross violation'' of Yugoslavia's sovereignty. 
He also accused the council of trying to dismember Yugoslavia by 
passing a resolution allowing for what he said would be the 
secession of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing's main concern was that the resolution would be enacted  
under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which makes it militarily 
enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	China had wanted military action under Chapter 7 limited to  
protecting international personnel sent to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture to Beijing, council members did bow to China's  
other main concern late Wednesday, allowing the resolution to 
stress the principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly the 
responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of 
international peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
	China and Russia had based their opposition to NATO's airstrikes  
on the grounds that the alliance had taken matters of international 
peace into its own hands when it launched airstrikes March 24 
without approval from the council, where both members have veto 
power.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Negotiating Haskins' Buyout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota is negotiating a  
contract buyout with basketball coach Clem Haskins amid allegations 
of academic fraud involving the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks with Haskins' lawyer, Ronald Zamansky, began last week but  
the matter became public during a regents meeting on Thursday. 
Regent Robert Bergland said regents didn't object to negotiations 
to buy out Haskins' contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the clear, overwhelming consensus was that we're going  
to wait until the president gets what he needs for decisions, and 
then we'll find out in more detail what's happening and counsel 
with him on what to do,'' Bergland said after Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In an open meeting to discuss gender-equity goals, McKinley  
Boston, vice president of athletic and student affairs, didn't 
comment on buyout negotiations and declined to answer questions 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof authorized university general  
counsel Mark Rotenberg to begin negotiations with Haskins, even 
though an investigation into the scandal won't be completed until 
September. Rotenberg said Thursday no agreement had been reached 
and there was no timeline for the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston signed Haskins' 10-year contract in 1994 when he was the  
men's athletic director. It includes an unusual clause that allows 
Haskins to receive $423,000 in deferred compensation even if his 
contract is terminated with just cause. If just cause cannot be 
shown, Haskins would be entitled to almost $1.2 million, plus 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotenberg, who gave the status report on the negotiations to  
regents, declined to discuss their reactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what happens, the investigation will be completed  
even if something happens and coach Haskins leaves,'' Bergland said 
after Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof would not say what prompted him to authorize the talks  
now, nor would he comment on any timeline for further action. Yudof 
and Rotenberg said the university hadn't begun looking for a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Various factors may be pressuring the university to move  
quickly. Yudof will be out of the country July 10-23 for a working 
trip to Europe and the Middle East. Haskins' contract includes a 
clause that would increase his buyout by $74,299 if he is released 
after July 1. And basketball recruiting could be hampered if the 
coach's status remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins, who has referred all calls to his lawyer, has denied  
any knowledge of academic cheating in his program or improper 
payments to players. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach is accused of tolerating and facilitating academic  
fraud among men's basketball players, misusing booster club money 
and intervening on behalf of athletes accused of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Former university employee Jan Gangelhoff said she did course  
work for at least 21 players from 1993-98, which was confirmed by 
four players, prompting the university to suspend four other 
current players from the NCAA tournament opener against Gonzaga in 
March.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Ruling Party Bounces Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party,  
written off before this week's historic election as a spent force 
because of its authoritarian past, bounced back in vote counting 
Thursday. Party officials predicted it still might be able to lead 
a coalition in a new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a development would dash the hopes of pro-reform parties,  
democracy activists and student protesters that the first free 
election in Indonesia in 44 years would wipe away the remnants of 
President Suharto's rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The autocratic Suharto, who like many Indonesians uses only one  
name, held power for 32 years thanks in part to support from 
Golkar, which enjoyed a huge parliamentary majority. 
</P>
<P>
	While those days appeared to be over, Golkar officials predicted  
the party would emerge with enough seats to block the rival 
frontrunner, Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party 
for Struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, Golkar might be able to reinstall Suharto's unpopular  
hand-picked successor, President B.J. Habibie, when a head of state 
is chosen by a special assembly in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all afraid of Golkar and what they represent being  
resurrected from the grave. We have to keep it out of power,'' said 
newspaper commentator Wimar Witoelar. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadel Muhammad, a senior Golkar official, predicted Golkar would  
get 30 percent of the vote. Analysts have said some minor 
Muslim-based parties could swing behind Golkar along with a bloc of 
non-elected military-appointed legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can form a coalition with any party that has a  
similar platform and accepts Habibie as president,'' Fadel said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far only 14.3 percent of the 113 million votes cast on Monday  
have been tabulated. The extremely slow count has raised fears of 
tampering, similar to the manipulation that allowed Golkar to win 
landslide victories in tightly controlled ballots under Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, who is fending off allegations of large-scale  
corruption, resigned a year ago after bloody riots and student 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest unofficial results had Megawati's party leading with  
35.2 percent of the vote, followed by Golkar with 20.9 percent. 
Third was Megawati's main ally, the National Awakening Party headed 
by Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, with 12.1 percent. Overall, 48 
parties fielded candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how many seats those numbers would  
translate to in Indonesia's complex system of proportional 
representation. But the top vote-getter is not necessarily 
guaranteed the most seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign and local polling monitors have said the election itself  
was generally free and fair, despite minor irregularities. However, 
they have criticized the slow count, saying it could undermine 
public trust in the new democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudini, head of the General Elections Commission, denied claims  
of widespread foul play and blamed the delays on slow and 
meticulous work by workers processing ballots in tens of thousands 
of villages. 
</P>
<P>
	He said problems were inevitable because the election was set up  
in only three months, compared with three years in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in Indonesia are impatient because this is the  
first time that we implemented a general election like this -- more 
democratic, more open and more fair,'' said Rudini, who uses only 
one name, like many Indonesians. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some provinces where there had been complaints about  
irregularities had been authorized to hold another vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The election for 462 seats in Parliament was the first step  
toward selecting a president. The new legislators will join 38 
representatives of the powerful military and 200 government 
appointees to choose a head of state in five months.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Ruling Party Bounces Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party,  
written off before this week's historic election as a spent force 
because of its authoritarian past, bounced back in vote counting 
Thursday. Party officials predicted it still might be able to lead 
a coalition in a new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a development would dash the hopes of pro-reform parties,  
democracy activists and student protesters that the first free 
election in Indonesia in 44 years would wipe away the remnants of 
President Suharto's rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The autocratic Suharto, who like many Indonesians uses only one  
name, held power for 32 years thanks in part to support from 
Golkar, which enjoyed a huge parliamentary majority. 
</P>
<P>
	While those days appeared to be over, Golkar officials predicted  
the party would emerge with enough seats to block the rival 
frontrunner, Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party 
for Struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, Golkar might be able to reinstall Suharto's unpopular  
hand-picked successor, President B.J. Habibie, when a head of state 
is chosen by a special assembly in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all afraid of Golkar and what they represent being  
resurrected from the grave. We have to keep it out of power,'' said 
newspaper commentator Wimar Witoelar. 
</P>
<P>
	Fadel Muhammad, a senior Golkar official, predicted Golkar would  
get 30 percent of the vote. Analysts have said some minor 
Muslim-based parties could swing behind Golkar along with a bloc of 
non-elected military-appointed legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can form a coalition with any party that has a  
similar platform and accepts Habibie as president,'' Fadel said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far only 14.3 percent of the 113 million votes cast on Monday  
have been tabulated. The extremely slow count has raised fears of 
tampering, similar to the manipulation that allowed Golkar to win 
landslide victories in tightly controlled ballots under Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, who is fending off allegations of large-scale  
corruption, resigned a year ago after bloody riots and student 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest unofficial results had Megawati's party leading with  
35.2 percent of the vote, followed by Golkar with 20.9 percent. 
Third was Megawati's main ally, the National Awakening Party headed 
by Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, with 12.1 percent. Overall, 48 
parties fielded candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how many seats those numbers would  
translate to in Indonesia's complex system of proportional 
representation. But the top vote-getter is not necessarily 
guaranteed the most seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign and local polling monitors have said the election itself  
was generally free and fair, despite minor irregularities. However, 
they have criticized the slow count, saying it could undermine 
public trust in the new democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudini, head of the General Elections Commission, denied claims  
of widespread foul play and blamed the delays on slow and 
meticulous work by workers processing ballots in tens of thousands 
of villages. 
</P>
<P>
	He said problems were inevitable because the election was set up  
in only three months, compared with three years in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people in Indonesia are impatient because this is the  
first time that we implemented a general election like this -- more 
democratic, more open and more fair,'' said Rudini, who uses only 
one name, like many Indonesians. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some provinces where there had been complaints about  
irregularities had been authorized to hold another vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The election for 462 seats in Parliament was the first step  
toward selecting a president. The new legislators will join 38 
representatives of the powerful military and 200 government 
appointees to choose a head of state in five months.

<HEADLINE> Fleisher Tries Following His Own Act  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Bruce Fleisher is just learning how to  
follow his own tough act. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher became the first player ever to win his first two  
career starts on the Senior PGA tour in February. He finished 
second the next two weeks, then added a third victory in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a ride,'' Fleisher said before Thursday's practice  
round for the BellSouth Classic. ``A lot of emotion, a lot of 
running around, a lot of demands. Things have settled down quite a 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher shot no higher than 70 in his first 12 rounds on the  
Senior tour, but has cooled off some since. His best finish in five 
events since winning the Home Depot Invitational was a tie for 13th 
a month ago at the Nationwide Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher attributes his fast start on the senior tour to playing  
regularly on the PGA tour until he turned 50. He has career 
winnings of $1.7 million on the PGA tour, and already has won more 
than half that much ($894,592) this year. That's second on the 
senior's money list to Allen Doyle, the only other three-time 
winner this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher said his whirlwind start proved to be a distraction  
he's just now worked his way out of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really been able to focus that well the last five or  
six weeks, and now I think I'm starting to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot an 8-under 64 in a pro-am on Wednesday the first time he  
played the 6,783-yard Springhouse Golf Club course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hitting the ball fine, but I haven't made a putt in six  
weeks,'' he said. ``You've got 54 holes, no cut. You'd better be 
putting out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even on his bad weeks Fleisher hasn't been terrible. He's  
finished in the top 10 in half of his 12 starts, never worse than 
27th. He leads the tour in four categories: scoring (69.85), 
putting (1.747), sand saves (66 percent) and all-around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really just happy to be out here,'' he said, the ``we''  
being him and caddy Dennis Turning. ``Winning is certainly a bonus, 
but we're still feeling our way around in the first year. Winning 
gives you the confidence you can do it, but it's hard to keep that 
intensity up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher is the leading money-winner in the field for the  
BellSouth, which begins Friday. Doyle, who won the Cadillac NFL 
Golf Classic last week, withdrew due to back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Isao Aoki, the 1998 champion and winner of two of the last three  
BellSouth Classics, is back to defend his title. All the former 
champions are here: Gil Morgan ('97), Jim Dent ('95) and Lee 
Trevino ('94). 
</P>
<P>
	The total purse is $1.4 million, with $210,000 going to the  
winner.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Jump by 14,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits rose last  
week to the highest level since early January, but economists 
shrugged it off as a temporary blip in a job market that remains 
exceptionally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Thursday that 323,000 Americans  
filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending June 5 -- 
up 14,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump pushed jobless claims to the highest level since the  
week of Jan. 9, when there were 358,000. After reaching that peak, 
they declined for nearly two months. They remained below 300,000 
for nine straight weeks, the longest stretch in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which smoothes  
out week-to-week volatility, also was up slightly to 308,250. That 
was the highest level since May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in last week's new claims was unexpected, but  
government analysts noted that the reporting period included the 
Memorial Day holiday. Weeks including a holiday have often been 
erratic in terms of the number of people showing up in benefit 
claims offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, economists cautioned against reading too much into  
the latest weekly figure. They also expressed doubts that the 
one-week increase would influence the Federal Reserve very much as 
it considers at month's end whether to raise interest rates to slow 
down the economy and keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too soon to say that it would ease the Fed's concern, but  
potentially there are the seeds of some good news there'' if weekly 
claims continue to grow, reflecting signs of a needed slowdown in 
the economy, said Astrid Adolfson, an economist with MCM 
MoneyWatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter economist Kevin Flanagan agreed,  
adding that the Fed is likely to give more weight to upcoming 
government reports on consumer prices and producer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer prices spiked up 0.7 percent in April, the biggest gain  
in nearly nine years, the government said, sparking concerns that 
inflationary pressures may be rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also reported last week that the nation's  
unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in May, returning to a 
29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, manufacturing has lost more than 453,000 jobs in the past  
14 months due to the global financial crisis, which has cut into 
exports and increased cheap imports into this country. But the rest 
of the U.S. economy, powered by strong consumer spending, is 
continuing to show robust growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that for the week ending May 29, 18  
states and territories reported declines in jobless claims while 35 
had increases. The state data lags a week behind the national 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina had the biggest declines in benefit applications,  
a drop of 1,210, which was attributed to fewer layoffs in the 
electrical equipment industry. Other states with big drops in 
claims were California, Oregon, Georgia and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan had the largest increase in jobless claims with a jump  
of 1,938 applications, a rise blamed on auto industry layoffs. 
Other states with big increases were Texas, blamed on layoffs in 
the apparel and trade industries, and Mississippi, attributed to 
layoffs at apparel and electrical equipment factories.

<HEADLINE> Dismore Eecovers From Crash in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Mark Dismore recovered from a Thursday  
afternoon crash to outrun teammate Scott Sharp for the pole 
position for the Longhorn 500 IRL race at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore, 42, a national go-kart champion at age 11, lapped at  
215.272 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp, who also drives for the Kelley Racing team and who paced  
both of Thursday's practice sessions, qualified second at 214.839 
mph. Tyce Carlson was third at 214.417 and Greg Ray fourth at 
213.805. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Billy Boat was 11th of 26 entrants at 211.671  
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not been an up day actually. It was a bit of a downer.  
But this sure makes up for it,'' Dismore said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first afternoon run, Dismore made contact with an outside  
retaining wall exiting turn 4. His car became loose between turns 3 
and 4, and there was light damage to his right front wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore, who broke his neck, both feet, right wrist and right  
knee in a crash during practice for the Indy 500 in 1991, climbed 
out of the car without assistance. After evaluation in the infield 
care center, he was cleared to drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The laps were well off the track one-lap qualifying record of  
225.979 mph set last September and the one-lap race record of 
228.012 set by Tony Stewart a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the Indy Racing League's first competitive event on a  
high-banked oval since the ill-fated VisionAire 500 at Concord, 
N.C., on May 1 in which three spectators were killed by flying 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL moved to reduce speeds slightly beginning with the  
Longhorn 500 by lowering maximum RPMs from 10,300 to 10,000. It 
follows a reduction in the RPMs from 10,500 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismore began racing karts in 1968 and won 40 grand national  
kart races through 1989. He made his Indy-car debut at Mid-Ohio in 
1989, won the Formula Atlantic Pacific Division championship in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Indy but did not qualify in 1992-93. He won the 24  
Hours of Daytona in 1993 and at Nazareth in 1994 in his only 
Formula Atlantic start. His best IRL finish is fifth twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great place for a race,'' Sharp said. ``It's fast,  
it's smooth, there are multiple grooves, and that means great 
racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race is the fifth in the IRL's 11-race season.  
</P>
<P>
	Race speeds Saturday are expected to drop more than 3 mph  
because with the reduction in RPMs. In theory, lower speeds make 
the cars more driveable, resulting in fewer crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	TMS is a 1.5-mile quad-oval with 24-degree banked turns, similar  
to Concord and Atlanta Motor Speedway, which was built for heavier 
and slower stock cars. IRL races have been staged at TMS and 
Concord since 1997 and at Atlanta since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Browser Discussed at Microsoft Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer expert testified in the Microsoft  
antitrust trial today that there was no technical reason for the 
software giant to bundle its Web browser into its popular Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton  
University, testified in December to describe a program he created 
that disabled Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, within 
Windows. He took the stand today after government attorneys 
introduced as evidence a newer version of his program, as well as a 
program to reinstall the browser. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many ways in which Microsoft can go about delivering  
Windows 98 without IE,'' Felten said. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that his method of removing the browser, which he  
said did not affect the overall operation of Windows, was not the 
only way it could be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of this is to show that Microsoft can do this,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten was the last rebuttal witness called by the Justice  
Department in the antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, attorneys questioned an IBM manager who shrugged  
off e-mails that Microsoft said contradicted his sensational 
courtroom allegations that the software giant offered price 
discounts on Windows if IBM would agree not to distribute rival 
Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confronted Garry Norris, a mid-level executive, with  
e-mail from another IBM employee that appeared to dispute the claim 
that Microsoft had pressured IBM to distribute Explorer software 
instead of software from rival Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no proposal on the table from Microsoft to  
exclusively bundle IE on the PC Co. line,'' IBM's Scott Bosworth 
wrote in the April 1997 e-mail. The message was sent shortly after 
Norris was transferred within International Business Machines Corp. 
to another division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess after I left, they took it off the table,'' Norris  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted that his handwritten notes from a meeting in March  
1997 with Microsoft were accurate, saying Microsoft offered to 
increase rebates available under its market-development agreements 
if IBM promised not to distribute Netscape's software. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Netscape &AMP; receive more MDA $ across the PC Co.,'' he  
wrote. His testimony supported another of the government's claims: 
that Microsoft illegally wields its influence over its dominant 
Windows operating system to crush competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Rick Pepperman grew exasperated over two days  
as he questioned Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris accommodated the Justice Department's lawyer with rich  
answers and an unfailing memory, but resisted Pepperman on every 
response, almost as Microsoft chief Bill Gates had fought with 
government lawyers when he was questioned over three days last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pepperman grew more and more frustrated throughout Wednesday,  
Norris smiled at one point, hands spread, and told him calmly, 
``I'm just trying to answer your questions, counselor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperman also confronted Norris with an e-mail summary by  
another IBM employee of the disputed March 1997 meeting in which 
there was no mention of any offer from Microsoft regarding 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris described the e-mail as a ``partial summary'' and said he  
called his colleague on the telephone, who told him he wanted 
Norris to ``handle that'' with senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris acknowledged that the software giant never explicitly  
offered price discounts on Windows if IBM agreed to sacrifice its 
rival OS/2 computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, he had cited a Microsoft contract offering discounts of  
$1 to $3 per copy of Windows, for example, if IBM would adopt 
Windows ``as the standard operating system for IBM'' and mention 
Windows as the only operating system in IBM advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suggested -- and Norris agreed -- that the  
contractual clauses actually were incentives for IBM to abandon its 
OS/2 software, which directly competed with Windows. Norris said 
IBM never agreed to those provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris conceded the contract does not explicitly require IBM to  
reduce or stop sales of its software. But he maintained that the 
cumulative effect of the contract ``has the effect of killing OS/2 
in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told by Microsoft they wanted us to drop, stop  
shipping OS/2,'' Norris said.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Gov. Announces Divorce Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Days after cursing at a reporter who asked  
about his private life, Gov. Kirk Fordice said today he and his 
wife are divorcing and he will marry a Memphis widow who recently 
was his traveling companion. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said he planned to marry Ann G. Creson, a longtime  
friend, who reportedly had been his junior high sweetheart years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Jim Becker, speaking for Fordice, also said that the  
governor and his wife, Pat, had been estranged for some time and 
the divorce would be resolved ``equitably and with dignity.'' The 
couple, married 44 years, have four children and 10 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice, 65, leaves office in about six months because of term  
limits. He has said he has no interest in higher office. He is 
serving as a national cochairman for the presidential campaign of 
former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is portraying himself as the 
family values candidate of the GOP presidential field in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fordice, who has criticized President Clinton's  
affair with intern Monica Lewinsky, threatened a reporter who asked 
him about the European vacation he recently took with Creson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me tell you something, you invade my privacy this way, six  
months from now, I'll whip your a--,'' a red-faced Fordice told 
WLBT reporter Bert Case, according to a videotaped recording. ``You 
have no damn business playing these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Fordices have for some time had attorneys to work out a  
property settlement, according to Becker. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer's statement said that Fordice had ``developed a close  
relationship'' with Creson, a longtime friend, and ``upon 
conclusion of divorce, he plans to marry her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fordice would have no comment, her assistant Cora Gee said.  
Ms. Gee would give no detail on Mrs. Fordice's plans for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice and his wife's marital troubles date to 1993, when he  
announced they were having ``irreconcilable differences.'' A day 
later, she issued a statement saying she would continue serving as 
first lady unless forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Mrs. Fordice said her husband had bought a $230,000  
home outside Jackson and never invited her to see it. She said she 
did not want a divorce, though she knew her husband's new home 
``wasn't for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors have said Fordice spends his weekends there, but they  
refuse to talk about other occupants. Fordice and the first lady 
both live in the official governor's mansion during the week. He 
has simply said the home is part of his private life. 
</P>
<P>
	Before today's announcement of divorce plans, the revelations  
had created a storm of criticism in the state. Caller after caller 
to Wednesday's ``Supertalk'' program on radio station WFMN said 
Fordice should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine percent were hard on him,'' said Paul Gallo, after  
callers used words like ``hypocrite,'' ``buffoon'' and ``national 
embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippians are generally very forgiving people. It's the  
inflammatory, in your face, don't-give-a-hoot attitude that people 
have found very offensive,'' Mississippi Baptist leader Paul Jones 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Friedeman, a minister and conservative columnist who urged  
Fordice to step down, said Quayle might reconsider having the 
governor as a national campaign cochairman. The campaign has seven 
such cochairmen. 
</P>
<P>
	But Quayle's spokesman, Jonathan Baron, said today that the  
former vice president is standing behind Fordice, adding, ``We are 
pleased to have such support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some state Republicans doubted Fordice would have much of a role  
in upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any candidates are going to closely associate  
with him,'' Alvin Endt, a GOP state representative who has 
supported Fordice, said before today's announcement. ``They're not 
going to ride his coattails after this. If they do, they're 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creson wouldn't comment Wednesday. Her husband of 43 years, Roy  
Franklin Creson Jr., died in November from cancer at age 66. He was 
the retired owner of Creson-Watson Manufacturing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	WLBT said Fordice and Creson were sweethearts in junior high  
school in Memphis and became reacquainted at a reunion in 1992, the 
year before the governor disclosed ``irreconcilable differences'' 
with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the governor crashed a state-owned car after he  
was seen having lunch with a woman near Memphis while his wife was 
in France. A waiter recalled serving wine to the governor and his 
female companion. It was never firmly established whether the woman 
was Creson. 
</P>
<P>
	Passers-by pulled Fordice from his car after it careened off a  
highway and caught fire. He was hospitalized for three weeks with a 
bruised heart and lung, fractured vertebrae, several broken ribs 
and a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordice has said he does not remember why he was in Memphis that  
day.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Challenges Gov't. Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer expert asked by the government to  
create a program that would remove Microsoft's Internet browser 
from its Windows operating system watched his program fail Thursday 
during a courtroom demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton  
University, took the stand as the government's final rebuttal 
witness in the Microsoft antitrust trial. He had testified 
previously; last December he described a program he wrote that took 
Internet Explorer out of Windows 98. A modified version of that 
program was introduced as evidence Thursday shortly after Felten 
made his second appearance in the witness box. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney Steve Holley immediately challenged the  
program's effectiveness, arguing that the program did not remove 
the browser from Windows, but simply hid it. To prove his point, 
Holley presented Felten with a laptop computer and asked him to 
install his new ``removal'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten resisted, saying he couldn't vouch for the effectiveness  
of the program since the computer he was given was loaded with 
numerous software programs, including multiple Internet browsers. 
The computers on which he had tested his removal program were 
loaded only with Windows 98. 
</P>
<P>
	He ultimately installed the program and, afterward, followed a  
series of instructions by Holley, at the end of which another 
Internet Explorer browser appeared on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is that, Mr. Felten?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how it got there,'' Felten responded. He  
maintained, however, that ``the removal program is still a valid 
proof of concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of this is to show that Microsoft can do this.  
...There are many ways in which Microsoft can go about delivering 
Windows 98 without IE,'' Felten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten's testimony -- that there is no technical reason for  
Microsoft to bundle its Web browser into the popular Windows 
operating system -- touches on a central claim in the government's 
antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that Windows and its browser are so closely  
integrated that it is impossible to remove the Web software without 
crippling Windows. The government, however, alleges that Microsoft 
illegally ``tied'' Windows and its browser to undermine Netscape 
Communications Corp., whose Web software is Microsoft's biggest 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department called upon Felten to testify again to  
help debunk previous testimony from a Microsoft executive who found 
Felten's original program full of bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule on the case without  
a jury, suggested another reason why some consumers may not want a 
browser integrated into their operating system: computer security. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the courtroom demonstration, he asked Felten whether  
there was a difference in risks between having the choice of a 
browser or having none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten said there was. Some companies, he said, may not want  
computers with Web browsers because it could allow employees to 
roam freely on the Internet. That could be risky for more 
inexperienced users. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems self-evident to me that the presence of a browser  
increases the risk of penetration of a virus,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten agreed, saying there was less chance of introducing a  
virus into a system if it didn't have a browser than if it did. 
</P>
<P>
	His main purpose in the trial was to rebut testimony from  
Microsoft executive James Allchin, who complained that Felten's 
tinkering disabled a popular feature in Windows 98 that allows 
consumers to install off the Internet incremental updates and 
improvements to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten testified that the new version of his program leaves such  
files intact.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Vote on Y2K Litigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate was moving toward passage of  
legislation to protect businesses from being broadsided by lawsuits 
arising from computers tainted by the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate bill, a compromise between Republicans and  
Democrats that has been months in the making, faces a tough future, 
criticized on the one hand by House members who say it is too weak 
and on the other by the Clinton administration, which says it is 
too strong and will be vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with  
the help of Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher 
Dodd of Connecticut, would give companies 90 days to fix Y2K 
glitches before lawsuits can be filed and would encourage 
mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It would limit class action lawsuits, ensure that most companies  
are liable only for the proportion of the damage they cause and set 
punitive damage caps for companies with 50 or fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure to pass this responsible legislation would be like  
sticking a monkey wrench in the high-tech engine that is driving 
our economic prosperity,'' Wyden said. Business leaders who have 
actively lobbied for the bill have said it is their top legislative 
priority for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, possible today or Friday, the bill would have to  
be reconciled with a House-passed version that is stronger in 
protecting defendants from lawsuits and supporters would have to 
deal with the White House veto threat. The administration says the 
Senate bill, while better than the House alternative, still goes 
too far in curbing a consumer's legal rights to seek damages for 
economic losses. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday the Senate defeated, 57-41, a substitute version  
offered by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that was acceptable to the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry's measure, while similar in most respects to McCain's,  
would have exempted individual consumers from the limits set by the 
legislation, eliminated all punitive damage caps and applied 
proportionate damage -- holding companies responsible only for their 
share of damage caused -- only to defendants that had alerted users 
to Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to exempt consumers  
from the bill was also defeated, 65-32. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone Democrat to speak out against the need for lawsuit  
controls was Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Hollings said 
trial lawyers and punitive damage awards are essential to consumer 
interests in America and linked enthusiasm for a litigation bill to 
the political contributions of the high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Valley has got the money and people are falling over  
pell-mell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 96.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Qualifies for Matching Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful and conservative  
activist Gary Bauer announced Thursday that he has raised enough 
money to qualify for federal matching dollars in January 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	To become eligible for matching dollars, a presidential  
candidate must raise a minimum of $5,000 in each of at least 20 
states. Bauer's campaign met that threshold in 23 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's campaign must now begin submitting monthly reports to  
the Federal Election Commission -- which oversees the matching funds 
-- in order to receive money at the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bauer campaign is continuing to gain valuable resources  
nationwide,'' said campaign manager Frank Cannon.

	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Less than a week after his appointment, a  
California co-chairman of George W. Bush's presidential bid 
resigned after conflict-of interest questions were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruben Barrales, chief executive officer of Joint Venture:  
Silicon Valley, quit after board members of the nonpartisan group 
suggested his political activities were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture is a regional collaboration of public organizations  
and private businesses working to improve the economy and quality 
of life in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inappropriate for the head of the organization, in my  
view, to take an activist role, to say nothing of a leadership 
role, in a political campaign,'' said venture member Jay T. Harris, 
publisher of the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to avoid any appearance of partisanship,'' Barrales  
said Wednesday. ``It was a decision I reached on my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of six co-chairmen for the Texas governor's California  
effort was carefully selected to represent the state's racial and 
economic diversity. They were named June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrales is Hispanic, like the fastest-growing segment of the  
California electorate, and also represented the crucial high-tech 
industry.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- GOP hopeful Gary Bauer became the latest  
GOP candidate to bash Texas Gov. George W. Bush on his abortion 
stance Thursday, arguing the front-runner is ducking the issue and 
won't commit to name only anti-abortion justices to the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of making that commitment, Governor Bush talks about  
all sorts of side issues and avoids the heart of the matter,'' said 
Bauer, in an interview. ``It's consistent with his lack of 
leadership, quite frankly, generally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Bush's vagueness on many issues during the early  
stages of the campaign will not sit well with conservative 
activists who decide Iowa caucus campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see, I think, that his campaign peaked a couple  
of weeks ago,'' said Bauer. ``As more details come out on these 
sorts of issues, conservatives generally are going to find it very 
hard to swallow the vagueness of his agenda.''

	Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, who is president and owner of a North  
Carolina publishing and communications company, brings a solid 
business and fund-raising background to the Dole team.

	McElveen-Hunter has raised money for several charitable  
organizations, including Habitat for Humanity and the United Way. 
Her company, Pace Communications, is one of the largest 
female-owned companies in the country.

communications strategist for the Bush campaign, dealing mainly 
with print reporters and helping coordinate the campaign's state 
press secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	For 26 years before joining Racicot's staff in 1993, Malcolm was  
a reporter, columnist and bureau chief for The New York Times.

	AUSTIN (AP) -- The ``Biography'' television show devoted to Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush was viewed in some 1.86 million households. 
That tops a show about another presidential candidate, but falls 
far short of breaking the record for the show, program officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, which aired Wednesday night on the A&AMP;E cable  
network, topped an earlier ``Biography'' about Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., which averaged 1.61 million households. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the network, both presidential hopefuls trail far  
behind the leader in ``Biography'' ratings: Andre the Giant. A 
program about the late wrestler's life was watched by a record 3.4 
million households in January.

	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news  
agency is reporting that the last airstrikes occurred early 
yesterday evening, when the city of Urosevac in southern Kosovo was 
hit. ``The enemy aircraft fell silent after that,'' Tanjug said. 
Yugoslav and Western generals signed a pact yesterday clearing the 
way for a peace plan for the shattered Serb province after 78 days 
of intense NATO airstrikes. The alliance began bombing Yugoslavia 
after President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign a peace 
agreement for Kosovo

Christian Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have been 
separated since the Great Schism in 1054 in a dispute over papal 
authority and interpretation of their creed. The dispute is rooted 
in a decision by Emperor Constantine in 330 to move the capital of 
the Roman Empire to Byzantium, later Constantinople. John Paul, the

have been swamped by the 113 million votes cast in Monday's

vote in 44 years. By today, unofficial results released to 
journalists showed that 8.2 percent of the votes had been

<HEADLINE> Bob Knight Investigated in Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight is  
being investigated for assaulting a fellow patron at a restaurant, 
Monroe County Prosecutor Carl Salzmann said today. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed, but Knight may face a misdemeanor  
charge of battery, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in 
jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said the 38-year-old man who claims he was assaulted  
also could be charged with provocation, a Class C infraction that 
carries a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you provoke somebody to commit battery, and a battery  
occurs -- do you charge both people?'' Salzmann asked. ``That's what 
we're trying to figure out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said he had a preliminary report from Indiana State  
Police on the incident, but wanted more information before deciding 
whether to charge either or both men. 
</P>
<P>
	The altercation occurred about 9:30 p.m. Monday at a Mexican  
restaurant in Ellettsville, about five miles from Bloomington, 
Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight had been dining with his wife and her two sisters when  
the other man, who was dining with a friend, took offense to 
comments he overheard Knight making. The man confronted Knight as 
he was preparing to leave, claiming the comments he had overheard 
were racist, Salzmann said. The other man was white. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight paid his bill and walked to the parking lot, where the  
altercation continued and the man claims Knight grabbed him around 
the throat and lifted him into the air, Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other man then returned to the restaurant and called police.  
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said the man later sought medical treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	A state trooper, along with an Ellettsville police officer,  
responded and took pictures of injuries the man said he had 
suffered, Salzmann said. They also questioned the man, his friend, 
Knight's wife, one of her sisters and the restaurant manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said he still wants state police to talk to several  
unbiased witnesses, including other restaurant workers and patrons.

<HEADLINE> FCC Look To Improve Rural Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission will ask  
telecommunications companies whether regulations need to be relaxed 
in order to improve Internet access in rural areas, its chairman 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also intends to hold field hearings to hear the  
concerns of rural residents, Chairmen Bill Kennard said after 
meeting for an hour with a group of farm-state Senate Democrats, 
led by Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers want the commission to subsidize high-speed  
Internet access in rural communities. Kennard said the commission 
would consider the idea but left a brief news conference without 
taking questions on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet ``is as important to rural America as the highway  
system was in the 1940s and 1950s and the railroads were at the 
turn of the century,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress said in a 1996 law that rural areas should have  
telecommunications services ``reasonably comparable'' to those in 
cities. But lawmakers left it up to the FCC to decide how to 
accomplish it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already is funneling nearly $1.7 billion in  
subsidies to schools and libraries this year, including those in 
rural areas and inner cities, for a variety of telecommunications 
needs, including Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC recently voted to boost that funding to $2.25 billion,  
despite concerns it would raise phone bills. The money is collected 
from phone companies, which usually pass the fees on to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators say farmers, rural businesses and small-town  
health-care facilities need access to high-speed Internet services 
for transmitting graphics and large amounts of data. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the revolution in telecommunications continues to advance,  
we cannot let our country be divided into technological haves and 
have-nots,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Gives Clinton Win-Win Moment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, addressing the nation as  
commander in chief, got to deliver the best possible news to 
Americans: The war is over, and not a single American died in 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Even many Clinton detractors are giving him credit for a  
remarkable political achievement -- capping a risky, 11-week 
military campaign against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	If ever there was a win-win moment for the president, who only  
months earlier stood on impeachment trial in the Senate, this 
clearly was it. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Kosovo we did the right thing. We did it the right way. And  
we will finish the job,'' Clinton said in a speech Thursday night 
to the nation. And with the exception of a few still-disgruntled 
Republicans, few politicians seemed interested in challenging that 
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is a plus for Clinton overall,'' said Lee  
Hamilton, who heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for 
scholars, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fought a war that got the results he wanted without a  
single casualty. That is phenomenal,'' said Hamilton, former senior 
Democrat on the House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	And even if sometimes grudgingly, many leading Republicans  
joined in the applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``All Americans should be relieved,'' said Sen. John McCain of  
Arizona, a 2000 Republican presidential candidate who had been 
sharply critical of Clinton for not planning for a ground war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can argue about whether we should have become involved in  
this conflict and about how we prosecuted the war, but we should 
all agree that our victory is very good news for the United States, 
NATO and for the world,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	And House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters, ``We  
are thrilled, very happy, relieved that there is an agreement in 
Kosovo. ... I think we can all be very happy and prayerful that 
that's happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean Republican attacks on Clinton have been  
stilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his harshest detractors in the House were unwilling to  
give the president any credit. ``It can be argued that Mr. 
Milosevic has accomplished most of his goals,'' said Rep. Duncan 
Hunter, R-Calif. ``This is certainly no victory,'' said Rep. Mark 
Souder, R-Ind. He said Kosovo was less stable now than it was 
before 11 weeks of bombing. ``If this is a victory, what would a 
defeat look like?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Clinton was receiving widespread praise elsewhere, the  
House was debating -- incredibly, said Democrats -- a Republican 
provision to bar funds for peacekeepers in Kosovo after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The House in the end rejected the provision -- during debate on a  
defense spending bill -- on a 270-155 vote. But only after Clinton 
promised in writing that he would seek congressional approval for 
funding the 7,000 American peacekeepers and to pay for them 
``without harming military readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, 142 Republicans voted in favor of keeping the funding  
cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a death wish on the part of Republicans,'' said  
Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mann also suggested Clinton may not be able to reap as much  
of a boost from the victory as President Bush did, if briefly, from 
his 1991 Gulf War victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans aren't deeply engaged in this issue. But you can be  
sure, at least at this stage, they're grateful for an end to the 
bombing,'' Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton said the real ``genius of this agreement'' may be that  
it also offers Russians an opportunity to claim a much-needed boost 
in prestige at a time of deteriorating relations between Washington 
and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to say they ended the war. They were the key  
actors in the diplomacy. Their ideas were rejected, but their role 
was enhanced,'' Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans in Congress seemed incredulous that Clinton had  
managed to pull it off yet again -- producing a political victory 
after following a course fraught with risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are we so eager to say a victory has been achieved?''  
asked Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., one of the House impeachment 
managers in the Senate's trial of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Greenstein, a political science professor at Princeton  
University, said Clinton is now ``standing tall, having suddenly 
played commander-in-chief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Greenstein added that it's hard to know what the  
impact of the achievement will be, coming so late in Clinton's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how it's going to fit into the obituary,''  
Greenstein said. ``Will it replace Monica?''

<HEADLINE> Gwynn's Return Pushed Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn's quest for 3,000 hits remains on  
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn felt a knot in his left calf before Thursday's game  
against the Oakland Athletics and his planned return to the San 
Diego Padres' lineup was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The banged-up Padres held off activating Gwynn from the 15-day  
disabled list in order to see how he felt during batting practice. 
Rookie Mike Darr, who would have been optioned to Triple-A Las 
Vegas had Gwynn been activated, was told to take batting practice 
and be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Darr ended up starting in right field and batting second, the  
fourth straight game in which manager Bruce Bochy has started three 
rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn ``said he felt good yesterday, but that doesn't mean he'll  
feel good today,'' general manager Kevin Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Gwynn, who is 25 hits short of 3,000, didn't  
have much to say after San Diego's 2-1 win over Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about nothin' today. Sorry,'' said Gwynn,  
who has been out since straining his left calf coming out of the 
batter's box against Cincinnati on May 21. ``I'll try again 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn thought he was ready to return Wednesday night, but Bochy  
held him out and said he planned to start the eight-time batting 
champion Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just felt a little something in there and didn't want to  
take a chance,'' Bochy said Thursday. ``We're going to give him a 
day or two. As much as he wants to play, he did own up to some 
discomfort. He did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres open a three-game series at Houston on Friday. Bochy  
said Gwynn could be activated Saturday, or, with an off day Monday, 
the team might wait until it returns to San Diego Tuesday night to 
face Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Gwynn returned Thursday, he would have been on pace to get  
his 3,000th hit July 1 against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the final 
game of a seven-game homestand. The Padres are at Colorado July 
2-4, then come home to face San Francisco July 5 in the opener of a 
six-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were held to four hits by Jimmy Haynes and two  
relievers in losing 3-0 Wednesday night. They are 7-11 since Gwynn 
went on the disabled list May 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Gwynn went out, the Padres have been shut out three times  
and held to five or fewer hits six times. While Gwynn is hitting 
.333, five players who have started in right field during his 
absence are batting just .190 (12-for-63) with four homers and 
eight RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending NL champion Padres are hitting a league-low .247.  
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Wally Joyner, shortstop Chris Gomez and left  
fielder Reggie Sanders are also on the disabled list. Catcher 
Carlos Hernandez suffered a season-ending Achilles' injury in 
spring training.

<HEADLINE> Drug Testimony Admitted in Lewis Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The defense in the malpractice case stemming from  
the death of Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis won a victory 
Thursday when a judge allowed the testimony of a man expected to 
say he used cocaine with the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith denied a motion by  
lawyers for Lewis' widow that would have prevented Wayne Brown's 
allegations from entering the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In sworn testimony, Brown said he used cocaine with the NBA  
All-Star on several occasions. Brown apparently is overseas and 
unavailable to testify in person, so his testimony would be read 
aloud in court, if defense lawyers decide to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the main defendant in the suit filed by Donna  
Harris-Lewis, has testified that Lewis confessed two weeks before 
his death in July 1993 that he had used cocaine -- a claim 
vehemently denied by his widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, a renowned cardiologist, and consultants Drs. Mark  
Creager and Peter Friedman, were sued by Harris-Lewis, who claims 
they misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's fatal heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier diagnosis by a team of doctors said Lewis had a  
life-threatening arrhythmia after he collapsed during a playoff 
game. Mudge said during a May 1993 news conference that Lewis' 
heart was normal and that he suffered from a neurological condition 
that causes fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Lewis died of an arrhythmia, or abnormal heart  
rhythm, while practicing jump shots. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has said the late cocaine admission by Lewis made an  
accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Dr. Robert J. Myerburg, chief of cardiology at  
the University of Miami School of Medicine, testified as an expert 
on behalf of Friedman, who performed a test on Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Myerburg emphasized that Friedman was a consultant in Lewis'  
care, not his lead doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was consulted to give opinions,'' Myerburg said. ``He did  
not have overall responsibility for treatment plans.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Militia Members Sentenced in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- A militia member accused of plotting to  
kill government officials and commit terrorist attacks in western 
Michigan has been sentenced to 55 years in prison Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Graham, 42, had been convicted of conspiracy and of  
growing marijuana to bankroll the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said he and two other members of a group called the  
North American Militia plotted to assassinate Gov. John Engler, 
Sen. Carl Levin and federal judges. They also allegedly schemed to 
blow up the federal building in Battle Creek and the Internal 
Revenue Service building in Portage. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the alleged targets, U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen,  
on Thursday sentenced Graham, who claimed he was guilty of nothing 
more than talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Enslen responded: ``This was not talk in a coffee shop. Randy  
Graham was a domestic terrorist, one trigger pull away from killing 
people and blowing up buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham got the stiffest sentence of the three militia members  
arrested in 1998 after a two-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford Metcalf, 48, was sentenced to 40 years in prison.  
Kenneth Carter, 48, who cooperated with the government, pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy and got five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Bobsledding Event To Be in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- World-class bobsledding will return to  
Lake Placid in 2003, when the World Bobsled Championship is held at 
the two-time Olympic site. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki said Thursday the 14-day event will take  
place in February 2003 on a bobsled and luge track under 
construction at Mount Van Hoevenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship will feature a two-man competition Feb. 3-9 and  
a four-man competition Feb. 10-16. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Placid was home to the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics. The  
bobsled run used during the 1980 Winter Olympics fell into 
disrepair and the Adirondack Mountain village hasn't hosted a World 
Cup-level sliding event in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The bobsled championship is expected to draw 60,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
	``Lake Placid is regaining its international status as a premier  
sports facility,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Placid was chosen over Koenigssee, Germany for the  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Lake Placid beat out Lillehammer, Norway as site of  
the first Winter Goodwill Games to be held Feb. 17-20, 2000. It 
also will host the ESPN Great Outdoor Games July 20-23 that same 
year.

<HEADLINE> Restoration of Medicare Funds Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unless lawmakers restore some money they cut  
from Medicare to help balance the federal budget, the sickest 
senior citizens may suffer a lack of care, government and private 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be an access problem developing for the most complex  
patients,'' said William Scanlon, director of health financing at 
the General Accounting Office, Congress's auditing agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Scanlon and other government and private experts testified  
Thursday at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, which is 
confronting complaints about Medicare cuts that Congress set in 
motion in 1997 as part of an agreement to balance the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, lawmakers agreed to trim $115 billion from  
Medicare's spending over five years -- mainly from payments to 
health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, medical industry groups along with some patient advocates  
say the cuts were too deep and they are lobbying hard to get some 
money back. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts who testified Thursday said there's little evidence the  
1997 cuts are causing widespread harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not suggesting a wholesale redo of the balanced budget  
act,'' said Gail Wilensky, chair of the Medicare Payment Advisory 
Committee, a panel of private experts who advise Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said new per-patient payment limits on some health  
care providers -- including nursing homes, home health agencies and 
physical therapists -- may not provide enough for the most expensive 
patients. As a result, patients with very serious or chronic 
medical conditions may have trouble finding a nursing home bed or 
home health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilensky urged lawmakers to look for ways to target some extra  
dollars to health care providers ``to protect the very sickest 
patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The warning comes even as Congress is looking for additional  
Medicare savings this year to help prepare the health insurance 
program for the elderly and disabled for an onslaught of aging baby 
boomers in about a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers expressed frustration with the competing demands.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got the political theory that in even years we cut  
Medicare and in odd years we put the money back,'' said Sen. John 
Breaux, D-La.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Peterson Honored in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jazz pianist Oscar Peterson and choreographer  
Pina Bausch are among the five recipients of the 1999 Praemium 
Imperiale, considered Japan's Nobel prize for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The three others honored in a ceremony at Lincoln Center on  
Wednesday were painter Anselm Kiefer, sculptor Louise Bourgeois and 
architect Fumihiko Maki. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you not only on my behalf but on behalf of  
the music I represent -- jazz,'' said Peterson, 74, the son of a 
Canadian railroad worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``For as long as I can do it, I'll try to keep jazz in the  
forefront of the arts,'' he told a gathering that included Prince 
Masahito Hitachi, governor of the Japan Art Association that awards 
$650,000 in annual prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Praemium Imperiale, created in 1988, will officially be  
presented to the five recipients -- along with $121,00 each -- at an 
awards ceremony in Tokyo on Oct. 28.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices tumbled Thursday, pushing yields on  
30-year Treasury issues to their highest levels in more than 13 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32  
point, or $4.68 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.06 percent from 6.02 percent 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the highest closing level for the long bonds since they  
finished at 6.07 percent on April 29, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said an unexpectedly strong report on economic growth  
in Japan in the first three months of the year suggested that the 
global economic situation is improving and could generate 
inflationary pressures worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers have already indicated they are  
leaning toward a tighter monetary policy and many analysts expect 
they could raise interest rates later this month to curb inflation 
in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates would diminish the value of bonds already in  
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sentiment in the bond market remains distinctively negative,''  
said Williams V. Sullivan Jr., a senior money market economist at 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``There is no appetite to take risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the report from Japan that the economy there grew 1.9  
percent in the first quarter, the first gain since the summer of 
1997, set the tone for bond trading in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests the global economy is healing, and that means  
there is a greater chance of overheating and inflation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said the U.S. market faces a heavy calendar of  
corporate bond issues as well as a number of economic indicators in 
the next week that could show that the pace of consumer spending is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to step in front of these upcoming challenges''  
by buying bonds for the time being, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off by between 2/32 point and 7/32 point and intermediate 
maturities were off as much as 10/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.65 percent as the  
discount gained 0.06 percentage point to 4.53 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.01 percent, as the discount added 0.04 percentage 
point to 4.82 percent. One-year yields were 5.09 percent as the 
discount held steady at 4.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 1/4 percent from 4.75 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 25/32 to 119 21/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.51 percent from 5.46 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hearings Focus on Retirement System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats in Congress are  
talking of finding common ground to ensure the long-term future of 
Medicare and Social Security, but it's clear that major rifts 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, for instance, are opposed to the idea of  
creating new personal accounts that would be invested in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intend to gamble with my grandchildren's retirement,''  
said Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``If history is any guide, we don't have to worry about the  
market,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La. ``Over time, it will produce 
a higher rate of return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their exchange came Wednesday at a House Ways and Means  
Committee hearing on eight Social Security proposals that would 
ensure the program's solvency through retirement of the big baby 
boom generation. Across the Capitol, the Senate Finance Committee 
held a hearing on Medicare's future. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and members of both parties in Congress say  
they want to overhaul both programs using projected budget 
surpluses, but agreement is elusive amid the political jockeying 
for control of the House in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that ``some believe it would  
be to the benefit of Democrats if we ignored Social Security and 
blame the Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know most Democrats don't feel this way,'' said Rangel,  
senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. ``We have 
plenty of other issues with which to demonstrate our differences 
with Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said much the same thing  
in a letter to committee members: ``I truly believe that through 
hard work and a strong commitment, on both sides of the aisle and 
at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, consensus is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although lawmakers are also impatient to move ahead with  
Medicare changes, the Senate Finance Committee is confronting 
complaints about budget cuts set in motion by Congress two years 
ago, as part of the 1997 balanced budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, lawmakers agreed to trim $115 billion from  
Medicare's spending over five years -- mainly from payments to 
health care providers 
</P>
<P>
	Now, medical industry groups -- from health plans and hospitals  
to nursing homes and physical therapists -- along with some patient 
advocates, say the cuts were too deep and are lobbying hard to get 
some money back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said those issues are the ``first order  
of business'' this year and suggested they could get in the way of 
other action on Medicare -- including consideration of a proposal by 
Clinton to add new prescription drug benefits to the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers consider greater participation by private health  
plans in Medicare among the best prospects for saving the program 
money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	But Medicare officials told senators they are expecting more  
closings among private health maintenance organizations -- known as 
HMOs -- that already serve retirees. Last year, health plan closings 
affected more than 400,000 beneficiaries.

	The health plans say that Medicare budget cuts have squeezed  
them too far and are asking for some money back. But Medicare 
officials say that before 1997, there was evidence HMOs were paid 
too much and that factors such as stiff competition among health 
plans have contributed to the closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That suggests plan withdrawals have more to do with internal  
plan and marketplace considerations than Medicare payment 
volatility,'' said Medicare Deputy Administrator Michael Hash. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Ways and Means Committee, much of the Social Security  
discussion focused on proposals that would create new personal 
accounts that would invest money for future retirees. Each of the 
proposals would extend the program's life for at least 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said it is ``critical'' that Congress  
approve such personal accounts in the next few years to allow the 
investment money to begin building up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't wait to make this plan work,'' said Gramm, whose  
proposal would divert a portion of current payroll taxes into new 
personal investment accounts. ``If you want to avoid cutting 
benefits or raising taxes, you've got to do it next year.''

<HEADLINE> Answers Sought in Police Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Both the dead were black. Both officers are  
black. 
</P>
<P>
	Those facts haven't stopped activists and a Chicago alderman  
from making claims of racism following the deaths of two motorists 
shot by police over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said one of the dead, 26-year-old LaTanya Haggerty, was  
shot after an officer mistook her cellular phone for a gun. She was 
a passenger in a car pursued by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the other victim -- 22-year-old Northwestern  
University football player Robert Russ -- was shot accidentally 
Saturday as he tried to grab an officer's gun during a traffic 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're pulled over for a routine traffic stop, you  
shouldn't end up dead,'' said Alderman Dorothy Tillman, who is 
black. ``We cannot sugarcoat this. We cannot say that these were 
black officers and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillman spoke outside a City Council meeting Wednesday that  
erupted into a shouting and shoving match as protesters accused 
officials of downplaying the role race may have played in the 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	She has asked police to hand over data that could back up her  
assumption that even black officers treat black citizens 
differently than white citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting came as the White House instructed federal law  
agencies to collect race and gender data on people they stop or 
arrest. The move comes amid so-called ``racial profiling'' of 
minorities by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Mayor Richard Daley and Police Superintendent Terry Hillard  
say Chicago officers do not use racial profiling when deciding who 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, the nation's third-largest city with 2.8 million  
people, 39 percent of the population is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Five separate investigations of the Chicago shootings -- four by  
police and one by the Cook County state's attorney -- are under way, 
according to Hillard.

<HEADLINE> Airlines OK Customer Service Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's major airlines today agreed to a  
plan for better treatment of their passengers, a voluntary move 
aimed at holding off more serious mandatory directives from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of the 12-point plan, a draft of which was obtained  
Wednesday by The Associated Press, would commit airlines to meeting 
customers' essential needs during long, on-aircraft delays. That 
would include making ``every reasonable effort to provide food, 
water, restroom facilities and access to medical treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That commitment stems from the New Year's travel delays in  
Detroit, when passengers stuck on snowbound plans were held for 
hours in view of the airport terminal, in some cases without access 
to food, water or functioning toilets. Complaints about such 
treatment prompted several bills in the House and Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One such bill would require airlines to pay passengers  
compensation when they are stranded for more than two hours. 
Another would give passengers 48 hours to cancel nonrefundable 
tickets. Northwest Airlines, the focus for many of the New Year's 
complaints, also was criticized last week by the Transportation 
Department for its handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the nation's major airlines were planning to  
announce the plan during a midday news conference in downtown 
Washington. They had been expected to announce it during a news 
conference with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, but that was postponed 
Wednesday when last-minute glitches arose. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the  
trade group representing the airlines, said: ``Clearly there has 
been an outcry on this issue. Certainly Congress has been at the 
forefront of it. And we've been talking with members about it and 
ways to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides better treatment of stranded passengers, the airline  
plan would publicly commit the airlines to several things that have 
been proposed by Congress and the Clinton administration, or which 
already are the law or are the current policies of some carriers. 
According to the draft, they include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Providing the lowest fare available on telephone reservation  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Notifying customers of known delays, cancellations and  
diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Return of checked baggage within 24 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the baggage liability limit from the current $1,250  
per bag. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowing reservations to be held or canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	--Providing prompt ticket refunds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing airline procedures for accommodating disabled  
passengers or minors traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing and disclosing policies for all passengers who are  
kept off a flight despite a confirmed reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing in advance aircraft seating plans, rules on frequent  
flier redemptions and ticket cancellation policies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensuring flight partners provide comparable customer service.  
</P>
<P>
	--Assuring that all written complaints are answered within 60  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The service commitment says the plans will be completed by Dec.  
15 and fully implemented by June 15, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An Air Force mechanic has died from  
injuries he suffered in last week's crash of an American Airlines 
jet, raising the death toll to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Sgt. Jeffery Stewart, 33, died Thursday of multiple  
injuries. He was on life support after Flight 1420 crashed off the 
end of a runway in a thunderstorm, broke apart and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people died at the scene, including the pilot. More than 80  
of the 145 passengers and crew members were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who had been based on Okinawa Island in Japan, was  
coming to Little Rock Air Force Base for training in jet-engine 
repair, Master Sgt. Scott Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Hasek: All That's Missing Is Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ken Dryden. Jacques Plante. Terry Sawchuk. Billy  
Smith. Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	Any short list of hockey's greatest goaltenders must include the  
above names. How about one more: Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has won four Vezina Trophys as the NHL's top goaltender  
and the last two MVP awards. He was largely responsible for the 
Czech Republic's dramatic, unexpected and enthralling gold medal 
upset in last year's Olympics over traditional powers Canada, 
Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	All that's missing from the resume of the NHL player who,  
arguably, is most singularly responsible for his team's success is 
a Stanley Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as Hasek's Buffalo Sabres play the Dallas Stars for the  
oldest trophy in major pro sports, the Cup could be next. After 
that, most likely, would come acclaim as one of hockey's all-time 
greats and possible induction into the Hall of Fame following his 
eventual retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is aware that the MVP awards he won, those that  
goaltenders of a different era didn't win, came about after the 
voters became convinced that goaltenders were as important to 
winning or losing as forwards or defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek realizes that his place in history will not be fully  
preserved until he holds the Stanley Cup high above his head, as 
Plante and Sawchuk and Smith and Bernie Parent did. Votes don't win 
a Stanley Cup, but saves can. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is as comfortable with that as he is with sprawling to the  
ice or sticking out his glove to make a save, relying on a style 
that is far more horizontal than the goaltenders of old. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I win the Stanley Cup, I will know what it feels like, but  
until then I will not know,'' Hasek said. ``I've won an Olympic 
gold medal, but I don't know what it is like to win the Stanley 
Cup. I would like to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure on Hasek at the Nagano Olympics was enormous  
because he was playing for the pride of his homeland, where he 
still returns after the NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was two weeks, a sprint so to speak, not the two-month  
marathon that is the Stanley Cup playoffs. In the Olympics, it was 
lose one game and be gone. In the playoffs, the pressure is 
nightly, because lose one series and a team is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics and shutouts and save percentages don't matter in the  
Stanley Cup finals, only winning does. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to win the game, to give up less goals than the  
other goalie and, then, I have done my job,'' Hasek said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, yes, even the man known as the Dominator still gets nervous  
for big games. In the NHL, nothing is bigger than the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am nervous, but there is nothing bad about it,'' he said.  
``It is good to be nervous. It keeps you more focused, more 
concentrated and the pressure, I believe, is what helps me play 
better.''

<HEADLINE> America's Health Said Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Americans are eating more fruits and vegetables,  
seeing the dentist more often, and dying less frequently from 
breast cancer. But obesity -- among children especially -- has 
reached epidemic proportions, the surgeon general said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the health of Americans has improved in the decade  
since the government released its Healthy People 2000 goals -- a 
blueprint of more than 300 health objectives, from reducing smoking 
to increasing seat belt use. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, we're doing well,'' U.S. Surgeon General David  
Satcher said. ``In some ways, we still have some major 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in 1979, the Healthy People initiative has been  
reformulated each decade to provide a yearly review of Americans' 
health progress. Six months shy of the 2000 goal, many of the 
target areas are on track or have already been reached, according 
to Satcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher released the report shortly before speaking at Harvard's  
Medical School commencement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But some serious health problems continue to persist, most  
notably obesity, low-birthweight babies and a disturbing increase 
in childhood asthma, cases of which have almost tripled since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asthma has sort of caught us all by surprise,'' Satcher said.  
``We don't understand it, to tell you the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, there were 338 asthma hospitalizations for every  
100,000 children under the age of 14, an improvement since 1995, 
but significantly higher than the 284 hospitalizations observed in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	And there continue to be serious disparities in the health of  
whites versus minority groups. Black children, for example, are 
three to four times as likely as whites to suffer complications 
from asthma, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Improving nutrition and physical activity alone -- the surgeon  
general recommends exercising 30 minutes five times a week -- could 
reduce cardiovascular illness and deaths by 50 percent, and 
colorectal cancer rates by at least 40 percent, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 20 percent of children and more than half of Americans are  
considered overweight. Over 50 percent of Hispanic and black women 
are considered obese, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things going in the current direction means that we  
continue to load the population with people who are at greater 
risk'' of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and stroke, said Dr. 
Robert Fletcher, a professor of ambulatory care and prevention at 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence of low birthweight babies increased from 6.9  
percent of all births in 1987 to 7.5 percent in 1997. But much of 
that may be due to the larger number of babies being kept alive due 
to improved medical technology, Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	In encouraging news, 15 percent of the Healthy People objectives  
have met their goal, including areas of nutrition, maternal and 
child health, heart disease, breast cancer and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 44 percent of the objectives are heading toward the  
target, including child immunizations, mammography screenings and 
consumption of five fruits and vegetables a day.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Scores Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- After six straight  
failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile-defense system scored 
its first hit Thursday, shooting down a rocket in a test that left 
a puff of smoke and a twisted white trail of vapor across the 
desert sky. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a much-needed boost to the Army's effort to create an  
antimissile umbrella that would protect ground troops across an 
entire war zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system, is  
designed to use ground-launched missiles to destroy incoming enemy 
missiles. Some critics have complained that the cost is too high 
and have expressed doubts over whether it will even work. 
</P>
<P>
	``For all of those people who stood on the House floor and said  
missile defense doesn't work, guess what? Today we hit a bullet 
with a bullet,'' Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., one of the most outspoken 
advocates of a national missile-defense system, said in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous failures were an inevitable part of the process of  
developing a new technology, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD is supposed to strike missiles at high altitudes -- even  
above the atmosphere. In contrast, the Patriot missiles used during 
the Persian Gulf War to knock down Scuds strikes at lower altitudes 
and relies not on a direct hit but on a warhead that explodes near 
the target. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD also differs from President Reagan's unfulfilled vision of  
a ``Star Wars'' antimissile shield for the nation that could knock 
thousands of enemy missiles from the sky. That plan included 
high-powered orbiting lasers that would zap missiles in flight. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD had nine previous flight tests -- three to test equipment  
and six failed attempts to strike a target missile over the Army 
missile range in New Mexico. Three more flight tests are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	THAAD is made by Lockheed Martin Missiles &AMP; Space, which was  
fined $15 million after THAAD's sixth failure March 29. If THAAD 
cannot make a second successful intercept by July 16, Lockheed will 
owe an extra $20 million in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great day for America, the Army and the missile  
defense community,'' said Army Col. Lou Deeter, THAAD program 
manager. ``We appreciate all the people standing behind us and 
letting us prove this could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The target missile lifted off first, then the THAAD missile  
lifted off 120 miles to the south from White Sands and struck the 
target seven minutes later, creating a burst of debris in the clear 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can put it in four letters -- B-A-N-G,'' said Bob  
Hunt, spokesman for the Army's program executive office for air and 
missile defense in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	The aerial display could be seen throughout New Mexico and as  
far west as Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' said Lee Phares, a waitress who saw it on  
her way to work in Las Cruces, just southwest of White Sands. ``It 
was curved and it was pretty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group that has  
been critical of the program, was unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1-for-7 record isn't that much better than 0-for-6,'' said  
Brian Hughes, director of the group's national security reform 
project. It's a batting average that shouldn't put that in the 
starting lineup for missile defense.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 67.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply lower today as a strong  
economic report from Japan increased fears that continued growth in 
the U.S. economy may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 67.76 at 10,622.53, extending a loss of 219 points over the 
previous two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 8.25 at 1,310.39, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 20.99 at 2,498.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government said the nation's gross domestic product  
grew 1.9 percent in the first three months of the year -- a larger 
increase than expected, and the first since the summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That set off fears that Japanese demand for U.S. goods will  
swell, boosting the domestic economy even further and setting off 
inflationary pressure around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of inflation has prompted the Fed to say it might  
raise interest rates if it determines that higher rates would cool 
off runaway economic growth. Traders are closely watching economic 
reports and signals that could offer a clue to the Fed's next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, bank stocks like Chase Manhattan, down 1 1/4 to 72 9/16,  
were mostly lower. Higher interest rates can hurt bank profits as 
lending volume shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer fell sharply for a second straight day, losing 4 15/16 to  
100. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday restricted the 
use of its antibiotic Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 91.9 million shares, 
ahead of Wednesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.80 at 624.48, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.56 at 769.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.89 percent as  
investors anticipated the GDP report, which was released after the 
close of trading. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was 
down 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 was down 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> German Slave Labor Fund Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- After months of negotiations, 16 Germany companies  
that profited from Nazi-era slave labor announced details of a 
promised compensation fund Thursday, including a provision to pay 
victims living in eastern Europe less than those in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG, BMW AG and other major industrial concerns  
agreed to establish the fund under growing pressure from 
class-action suits in the United States on behalf of former slave 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the fund, the 16 companies made clear that their  
intention is to quash the suits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, reacting to the plan in a news conference in Munich,  
one of the leading lawyers in the suits, Edward Fagan of New York 
City, indicated that he was not satisfied with the plan presented 
by industry and said he will press on with legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies worked out details of the fund during months of  
negotiations led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's chief of staff 
Bodo Hombach. Hombach met two days ago with industry leaders to 
help draft the plan presented Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Further details -- including the value of the fund and the timing  
of the payments -- will be decided in coming weeks during meetings 
with U.S. and German officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they will make payments to forced laborers  
who worked for six months or more, and that claims will be honored 
in part based on need. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the lump-sum payments will be based on the average  
pensions in the claimant's home country -- accounting for the lower 
payments in poorer eastern European nations than in the United 
States, Canada and other western nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they were establishing a foundation,  
``Remembrance, Responsibility and the Future,'' to administer the 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A second foundation will be established to pay for people who  
worked in agriculture and for German municipalities, and for former 
prisoners of war.

<HEADLINE> Knicks on the Brink of NBA Finals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One more win, and the New York Knicks have a  
shot at their first title since the days of Willis, Clyde and Earl 
the Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
	One more loss, and the Indiana Pacers go home with their fourth  
Eastern Conference finals loss in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-game season for us,'' Reggie Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 of the best-of-7 series is Friday night, with Madison  
Square Garden the site of the most important Knicks game in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Game 7 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, also  
against Indiana, has New York had a chance to make it to the 
championship round and go for the franchise's first title since 
1973, when Willis Reed, Clyde Frazier and Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe 
led the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to do it for our fans at home,'' Latrell Sprewell  
said. ``I'd like to finish Indiana off there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an improbable scenario these Knicks find themselves in the  
second week of June. After a season of underachieving, bickering, 
backstabbing and barely qualifying for the playoffs, they stand 
poised to become the lowest-seeded team ever to make the finals. 
Just look at all the obstacles they are overcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Their franchise center, Patrick Ewing, is walking around in a  
cast, reduced to cheering on a cast of teammates who were all 
playing elsewhere five years ago the last time the Pacers and 
Knicks went at each other with so much at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Their beleaguered coach, Jeff Van Gundy, still doesn't know how  
badly the team's management wants him back -- or if they want him 
back at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Their leading scorer, Sprewell, is having to acclimate himself  
to a sudden shift into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Their starting center, Chris Dudley, doesn't score.  
</P>
<P>
	Their point guards, Chris Childs and Charlie Ward, are providing  
virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Their fans booed them as recently as Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one thought we would be where we are now,'' said Marcus  
Camby, who has emerged as a force in this series. ``Just the 
opportunity to go to the finals is a dream come true for most of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the Pacers have going for them heading into Game 6, aside  
from their advantages in depth and experience, is the Knicks' 
recent history of failing to seize the moment and make things easy 
on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round, they had an opportunity to finish off the  
Miami Heat in Game 4 at the Garden but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	In this round, they had an opportunity in Game 4 to take a  
commanding 3-1 lead at home but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mistake, and I think we made it after Game 3 in the first  
round, was saying we don't want to go back to Miami,'' Van Gundy 
said Thursday. ``We need to focus on what we want rather than what 
we don't want, and that's to go to San Antonio and have a chance 
for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing right now for us is how do we break the  
cycle of win, lose, win, lose. It's very difficult to win two in a 
row in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will need to repeat all the things they forgot about  
in Game 4 and did well in Game 5 -- pushing the ball upcourt, 
attacking the basket, hitting the open man, playing aggressively 
rather than tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can play our game -- defense, rebounding and unselfish,  
low-turnover offense, we'll have a chance to win,'' Van Gundy said. 
``I want them in the right frame of mind. I don't want them to be 
preoccupied with the result and tighten up. I want them to go for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can win this series if you try to avoid  
losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Pacers, everything that was present in Game 4 but  
missing in Game 5 -- bench contributions from Jalen Rose and Antonio 
Davis, energy and offensive aggression from Mark Jackson and Chris 
Mullin, speed getting back on defense -- needs to reappear in Game 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacers coach Larry Bird was especially harsh on his team after  
its loss Wednesday night, dumbstruck that it had given away a 
14-point lead and received poor efforts from so many key 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the situation we wanted to be in, but that's the way  
it is,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 11 conference finals tied at 2-2 in this decade, 10 have  
gone to the team that won Game 5. The exception was in 1994, when 
Miller scored 25 fourth-quarter points to beat the Knicks in the 
Garden, only to have the Knicks come back to win Game 6 in Indiana 
and Game 7 at home. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's Eastern Conference finals against the Bulls, the  
Pacers were facing a 3-2 deficit entering a Game 6 that they won at 
Market Square Arena before losing Game 7 at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Pacers played Orlando in the 1995 conference finals,  
they also needed a Game 6 victory but had the advantage of playing 
at home. They beat the Magic by 27 in that game, only to lose Game 
7 at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``If any team is capable of doing it (winning two straight  
elimination games), it's this team,'' Miller said. ``It's going to 
be electric in there, a fantastic atmosphere. I'm looking forward 
to it.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA May Bar Freshmen Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Should male basketball players be  
ineligible their freshman year? 
</P>
<P>
	Should the NCAA reward schools with high graduation rates by  
giving them extra basketball scholarships? And penalize schools 
with low rates by taking scholarships away? 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing will happen soon. But those controversial ideas are  
being considered by a special committee studying the problems of 
Division I men's basketball and could become NCAA law if approved 
by the policy-making board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is mixed sentiment among members of the  
working group on freshman eligibility,'' NCAA president Cedric 
Dempsey said. ``I would say there has been a growing interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several different options being looked at. I'm not  
sure which ones will surface at this point. But one concept is 
letting the entry-level student-athletes, including transfer 
students and international students, sit out a year and concentrate 
on their academics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany conducted his own study of  
Division I basketball and announced possible solutions to such 
issues as low graduation rates, gambling, agents and recruiting 
problems, the NCAA appointed a special 27-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, the NCAA was talking about a marketing study,''  
Delany said. ``I didn't think marketing was our problem, and I told 
them that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, whose chairman is Syracuse president Buzz Shaw,  
is expected to make formal recommendations in late July. They would 
be passed on to the NCAA management council, and from there go to 
the board of directors. The board might not act until October 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal applies only to men's basketball. USA Today, which  
first reported the proposal Wednesday, initially said it would also 
apply to women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is not considering ending freshmen eligibility for  
any other sport, including women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Delany is not certain the NCAA presidents would be willing to  
make men's basketball players ineligible as freshmen while letting 
all other athletes, including female basketball players, compete in 
their first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the answer to that,'' Delany told The Associated  
Press. ``But they should have the opportunity. I hope this 
committee is bold and does what it thinks is right for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freshmen have been eligible since 1972.  
</P>
<P>
	If the NCAA bars freshmen competition among men's basketball  
players, a court challenge would almost surely follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a judge would listen to different treatment for men's  
basketball if you could demonstrate with data how unhealthy 
Division I men's basketball really is,'' said Delany, a former 
chairman of the NCAA's tournament selection committee. ``You would 
need to have rationale for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delany conceded that barring freshmen males from basketball  
could encourage them to jump from high school to the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to me, that should not be a primary consideration,'' he  
said. ``Those players are not going to be (in school) very long 
anyway. At the end of the day, that's not an NCAA problem. That's a 
problem for the NBA players association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another possibly controversial move, the group is thinking  
about asking the board of directors to tie scholarship limits to 
graduation rates. Schools with low graduation rates in men's 
basketball would have fewer scholarships to offer than those with 
higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would want to be sure that schools are not penalized when  
student-athletes leave school in good academic standing,'' Dempsey 
said. ``We wanted people to use their imaginations, and they 
certainly are doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Males would be singled out for freshmen ineligibility because of  
their consistently low graduation rates. According to the NCAA's 
latest statistics, only 41 percent of male basketball players in 
the 1991 entering class got their degrees, including just 37 
percent of black players. That was the lowest of all groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The graduation rate for all Division I athletes was 57 percent.  
The rate for female basketball players, 66 percent, was the 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the general feeling is that the women  
student-athletes are not faced with the same kinds of issues that 
many of the male student-athletes are faced with,'' Dempsey said.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- How hot is it?  
</P>
<P>
	No, it's not the opening line to a joke, it's a common question  
at the Stanley Cup finals in Dallas. It's not about the temperature 
on the streets, which is warm enough, it's about the temperature 
within Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Players have been talking about it, particularly Buffalo goalie  
Dominik Hasek. He said he was so exhausted from the heat at the 
conclusion of Game 1 Tuesday night that he could not skate across 
the ice to celebrate the 3-2 overtime victory with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature during the day in Dallas was in the high '90s,  
and one league official said it could have been as high as the '70s 
inside the arena by the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the league had chipped in  
with the Stars to purchase a new refrigeration unit. The players 
didn't notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned with dehydration with a lot of the players  
and obviously the goaltender wearing all the equipment he (is 
wearing) is probably the worst-case scenario,'' Sabres coach Lindy 
Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE:* Thursday night's Game 2 of the Stanley  
Cup finals marked the 99th game for the Buffalo Sabres since the 
start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	A long season? Not for Sabres captain Mike Peca.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in the world work 11 1/2 months a year,'' Peca  
said. ``This is what we do. This is not a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSE CALLS:* Winning one-goal games in the playoffs is nothing  
new for the Buffalo Sabres. Their 3-2 overtime victory on Tuesday 
night improved their record to 7-0 in one-goal contests in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Stars are 6-5 in such games.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *VEZINAS APLENTY:* This year's finals feature a rarity: two  
goaltenders who are multiple winners of the Vezina Trophy as the 
NHL's top goalie. Buffalo's Dominik Hasek has four and Dallas' Ed 
Belfour, two (not counting this season). 
</P>
<P>
	Multiple Vezina winners in the finals have occurred only one  
other time in NHL history -- in 1946 with Montreal's Bill Durnan and 
Boston's Frank Brimsek. They each had two. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SABRES' STAT:* The Buffalo Sabres continue to get outshot in  
the playoffs -- and continue to win. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 games prior to Thursday night's Game 2, the Sabres had  
been outshot 10 times -- including 37-24 by Dallas on Tuesday night. 
The Sabres' record in those games: 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Sabres had a playoff-best 13-3 record prior to  
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *POWERLESS:* It might sound funny, but the Dallas Stars don't  
really like being on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think maybe it gets us a little bit out of our rhythm,'' Joe  
Nieuwendyk says. ``We like to play five on five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were handed 10 power plays in Game 1 and managed to  
convert only one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously our power play is going to have to score a few more  
goals if we get that many opportunities,'' Nieuwendyk said before 
Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WAITING GAME:* The fans started lining up early for tickets to  
Thursday night's game. One said he had been standing in line since 
11:30 a.m. in the humid Dallas weather, and the group had expanded 
considerably by 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	None of them knew when the box office would open, or if there  
were any tickets available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope so,'' said one young woman who was sprawled on the  
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOING GLOBAL:* The Stanley Cup finals gets around. It is being  
telecast live to most areas of the world, including Africa, the 
Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A PROSPECT:* The top amateur goaltender available in this  
year's Entry Draft? He's Brian Finley, a rookie with the Barrie 
Colts of the Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley appeared with other top prospects at a luncheon in the  
midst of the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very focused, uses his stopper very well and does a good  
job pushing the puck into the corner,'' says Frank Bonello, who 
directs Central Scouting for the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley said he started out as a forward until switching to  
goaltender at age 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it helps my goaltending now,'' Finley said. ``To be a  
good goaltender, you have to be a good skater.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Delay Passenger Rights Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public relations collided with political  
reality Thursday, and airlines scrapped an announcement about their 
plans to improve customer service. Senate leaders had complained 
that they had not signed off on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden reversal left the head of United Airlines, Gerald  
Greenwald, with the chore of standing before a roomful of reporters 
and announcing that a news conference called to unveil the proposal 
was being postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the coming days we will be working to refine and improve  
our plan in conjunction with Sen. John McCain and other leading 
members of the House and Senate,'' said Greenwald, who also serves 
as chairman of the airline's trade group, the Air Transport 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Without taking questions, he disappeared behind the closed doors  
of the association's board room, where the nation's other top 
airline executives were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	While the announcement triggered embarrassment among airline  
executives and chuckling on Capitol Hill, the parties agreed on a 
central point: The nation's major airlines and senators who have 
been complaining about the way they treat passengers are close to 
agreeing on a voluntary plan that would stave off congressional 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the package would be increased compensation for lost  
luggage, a promise to give passengers basic amenities when there 
are long on-board flight delays and a pledge to respond quickly to 
passenger complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The elements are drawn from several bills filed by the House,  
the Senate and the Clinton administration after passenger 
complaints peaked over the New Year's holiday, when thousands of 
travelers were stranded at Midwest airports following a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines came under particularly harsh criticism for  
holding passengers for hours on one jet in Detroit despite a lack 
of food and water and an overflowing toilet. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with the airlines have been led by McCain, R-Ariz.,  
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and co-sponsor of one of 
the passenger rights bills. Also participating have been McCain's 
co-sponsor, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., along with Sens. Slade Gorton, 
R-Wash., Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and 
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties had planned to hold a news conference on Capitol  
Hill to make a joint announcement, but that was scrapped Wednesday 
after airline haggling over details. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Air Transport Association announced that a  
consensus had been reached and it scheduled a midday news 
conference. The timing was driven by the fact that the executives 
were in town for their quarterly meeting. When the appointed hour 
arrived, however, Greenwald announced the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for several senators said support for the airline plan  
evaporated as senators read a headline in The Wall Street Journal 
saying the airlines were near an agreement with the White House. 
The headline bothered the senators because the Clinton 
administration had not been involved in the negotiations, the 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators also said they wanted tougher language on  
several points, including policies on handling lost baggage, 
accommodating passengers who get ``bumped'' despite confirmed 
reservations and public notifications when there are flight delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Marshall, a spokesman for Rockefeller, said an agreement was  
still possible despite the postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a good start and we're continuing to work with  
the airlines to get something done here that will be in the best 
interests of passengers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Resistance Members To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five former members of CIA-backed Iraqi  
resistance groups jailed for 2 1/2 years will be released while they 
seek asylum in another country, the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men belonged to two groups supported by the CIA as part of a  
U.S. effort to overthrow or weaken Saddam Hussein after the 1991 
Gulf War. When Saddam's troops swept through northern Iraq, 
thousands of opposition fighters and their families were evacuated 
by the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the men were detained by the United States. An  
immigration judge denied them asylum in March 1998 and ordered them 
deported, saying they were security risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement signed Thursday, five of the men will accept  
the deportation order and withdraw any appeals, said Russ Bergeron, 
spokesman for the INS in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth Iraqi rejected the agreement and will remain in custody.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was expected to be filed at immigration court  
early Friday, said Niels Frenzen, the attorney for the six men. 
</P>
<P>
	If the agreement is approved, the men will be able to join their  
families in Nebraska but will be under house arrest until granted 
asylum elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Sleep Over Dead Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Two German tourists spent the night  
on a motel room bed, unaware a dead body lay under them, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, whose names were not released, took a $36-a-night  
room Wednesday at the Burgundy Motor Inn, just off the city's 
casino strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they complained to the management about the smell, they  
stayed in the room overnight, according to officials. In the 
morning they were given another room. 
</P>
<P>
	Maids who came to clean the room looked for the source of the  
smell and found it after removing the mattress and box spring to 
find the body of a man in the box frame underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity and age of the man was not known, nor how long the  
body had been there.

<HEADLINE> 'West Side Story' Used in Dissent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the middle of his 28-page dissenting  
opinion from the Supreme Court's decision Thursday striking down a 
Chicago anti-loitering ordinance aimed at street gang members, 
Justice Antonin Scalia turned to ``West Side Story'' for 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, according to Scalia, is one reason the court should have  
upheld the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing  
alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out 
their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the 
gang is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive 
tattoos to passersby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officer Krupke, applying the ordinance at issue here, orders  
the group to disperse. After some speculative discussion (probably 
irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are depraved because they 
are deprived, Tony and the other gang members break off further 
conversation with the statement -- not entirely coherent, but 
evidently intended to be rude -- 'Gee, Officer Krupke, krup you.' 
</P>
<P>
	``A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests the group  
for failing to obey his dispersal order. Even assuming (as the 
justices in the majority do but I do not) that a law requiring 
obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is 
clear to the objects of the order, before its issuance, that their 
conduct justifies it, I find it hard to believe that the Jets would 
not have known they had it coming.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Owner Late for Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Running late, Daniel Snyder missed the first  
hour of his first practice as presumptive owner of the Washington 
Redskins. That didn't stop him from making some strong 
first-impression judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously some players are heavy and not where they need to  
be,'' Snyder said. ``We're going to fix that. And I could sense 
there are probably a few that don't want to play. Otherwise they're 
doing great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's visit, during Thursday morning's voluntary minicamp,  
was his first appearance at Redskin Park since his $800 million 
offer to buy the team was approved May 25 by NFL owners. He is 
expected to close the sale later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Snyder has been quiet about his plans for the team. His  
only firm position has been that he plans to retain the Redskins 
name despite objections from some Native American groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Like every other owner, Snyder says he wants to win, although  
his timetable seems to have shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, he said the Redskins were a rebuilding team. Now, he  
sees them as playoff-bound right away -- even though they are young 
and haven't been in the postseason since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the year we make the playoffs,'' Snyder said.  
``And this is the year we show Washington that we respect the fans 
and show we're committed. It's always important to win in every 
thing I do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to step up the heat and the pressure.''  
</P>
<P>
	During the NFL approval process, Snyder promised to retain coach  
Norv Turner and general manager Charley Casserly for what amounts 
to a one-year trial. However, he must also name a team president to 
run the operation on a day-to-day basis. Snyder is too busy with 
his local communications empire to take the role himself -- he 
couldn't even get through watching practice Thursday without his

	After practice, Snyder addressed the players briefly, discussing  
with them his passion to win and telling them not to be fooled by 
his age. At 34, Snyder is the youngest majority owner in the NFL.

<P>
	Snyder then spoke for 30 minutes with cornerback Darrell Green,  
who is five years older than his new boss.

<HEADLINE> FEC Allows Matching Internet Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a click and a credit card, Americans will  
be able to send contributions to presidential hopefuls over the 
Internet and earn the candidates extra financial assistance from 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission gave a major boost to fund  
raising in cyberspace on Thursday, agreeing to make credit card 
donations eligible for the federal matching funds presidential 
candidates receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize the reality that the Internet is here and a big  
part of our life,'' FEC Chairman Scott Thomas said after the 6-0 
vote. ``We need to let it be used freely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to find new outlets for money, financially struggling GOP  
presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander immediately hailed the 
decision as the ``greatest innovation in how we conduct campaigns 
since the advent of television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al  
Gore for the Democratic nomination, prompted the ruling by asking 
the FEC this spring to qualify his Internet donations for the 
federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	While it was legal for candidates to accept donations over the  
Internet, the FEC had refused until Thursday to count those 
donations toward the millions in matching dollars the presidential 
candidates receive each election. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Watergate-era campaign finance laws, the government  
matches the first $250 of each individual contribution that a 
presidential candidate receives. In return, the candidate agrees to 
strict spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big victory for us,'' Bradley said. ``We felt from  
the beginning that the Internet was going to be a big part of what 
we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the decision, Bradley had begun raising money over  
the Internet -- $169,000 through this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has 30 days in which it could overturn the new rules,  
which will apply to all contributions received since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will have a sweeping effect for the major candidates,  
all of whom have Web sites. Experts said it will prompt campaigns 
to make their fund-raising appeals by e-mail, a much cheaper option 
than traditional phone banks and letter solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step toward on-line fund raising, which will  
be the technology in the future that direct mail was 10 years ago 
and phone calls were 10 years before that,'' said Anthony Corrado, 
a government professor at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, have also  
been raising money via the Internet, but without credit cards. They 
ask potential contributors to print out a form on their Web sites 
and mail it with a check. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president has raised at least $17,000 that way, while  
Kasich has taken in more than $23,000, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who cut staff this month because of slow fund  
raising, said the Internet will enable candidates to reach out to 
more prospective donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as candidates develop techniques and people become  
comfortable making contributions on the Internet, it will greatly 
broaden the base of contributions,'' Alexander predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	It costs virtually nothing to send e-mails, and it's much faster  
than direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
	A candidate hoping to capitalize on a strong showing in Iowa or  
New Hampshire could quickly e-mail supporters seeking funds to 
continue the campaign, and contributors could donate instantly by 
credit card through the Web site, Corrado said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could save you nine or 10 days at a time when you don't  
have nine or 10 days,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Tinseltown' Subway Line Opens Sat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ceiling is covered with empty film reels.  
Fake palm trees rise to the roof. Two silent-movie projectors are 
enshrined as historical artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a subway station, Hollywood-style.  
</P>
<P>
	Six months behind schedule, the latest, 4.6-mile installment in  
Los Angeles' underground opens Saturday. It will create a 19-minute 
``Downtown to Tinseltown'' line that runs from Union Station to 
Hollywood and Vine -- Hollywood's most famous crossroads, and now 
one of the city's seedier intersections. 
</P>
<P>
	The total cost of the Hollywood segment and a smaller addition  
to the subway system: $1.74 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be the most-ridiculed transportation project in Southern  
California since Howard Hughes rolled out the Spruce Goose. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year project was marked by $288 million in cost  
overruns, a federal lawsuit, a fired contractor, and angry 
merchants who lost money because three blocks of Hollywood 
Boulevard were closed after a giant sinkhole opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The boulevard itself slipped, cracking sidewalks and forcing the  
removal of several stars from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Some shop 
owners simply left. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is hope the new route will help revitalize  
Hollywood Boulevard, where sidewalks have been repaired, the stars 
are back in place and a stage production of ``The Wizard of Oz'' is 
running at the Pantages Theater, across the street from the new 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	But will Angelenos get out of their cars?  
</P>
<P>
	``People in L.A. are spoiled,'' said David Balmas, 23. ``If my  
car breaks down, that's the only reason I'd use it. In this city, I 
don't think people want to use the subway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Metropolitan Transit Authority predicts the new line will  
more than double weekday boardings (a round-trip is two boardings) 
to about 80,000 by December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridership on the subway's first leg -- 6.5 miles running west  
from Union Station to the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and 
Western Avenue -- is estimated at 38,725 weekday boardings. 
</P>
<P>
	A third and final stretch will run from Vine Street to North  
Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley. Completion is estimated by 
next year, bringing the total mileage of the subway system in 
America's second-largest city to a mere 17.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvador Mendez, who runs a taco stand steps from the new  
Hollywood station and managed to hang on despite the construction 
problems, said he doesn't expect many new customers from 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says it's good that it is coming, but I don't  
know,'' Mendez said. ``I don't know if people will ride it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Durning, who lost his right eye to cancer and doesn't  
drive, said he thinks the subway is great. ``I would definitely 
take it over those crowded buses,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Honored at White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, who grew up rooting  
for the Chicago Cubs, donned a New York Yankees cap at a White 
House ceremony Thursday to congratulate the Bronx Bombers on their 
World Series win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This just puts the cherry on top for the '98 season,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said as rain drizzled down on the team, gathered 
on the White House lawn with the first lady and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton is in the midst of making herself over as  
``New York enough'' to be a Senate candidate there. And a day after 
a trip upstate where she was greeted with signs reading 
``Carpetbagger Go Home!'' she has taken a sudden, keen interest in 
the state's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	She revealed on Thursday that she is a Yankees fan and jumped on  
the New York Knicks' bandwagon. She introduced Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner, who after the ceremony said her likely GOP rival, New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, clearly is the superior Yankees 
fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor's been in New York all these years he's a great  
Yankees' fan; they don't come any better,'' said Steinbrenner, who 
has been a frequent ally of the mayor's. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee pitcher David Cone agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mayor Giuliani probably has the edge right now. He's a  
lifelong Yankees fan,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani on Thursday called the first lady's comments ``funny''  
because he hadn't seen her at any games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not disputing that she's a Yankee fan but I've been to  
Yankee Stadium maybe a thousand times in my life and I've yet to 
see Hillary Clinton there,'' said Giuliani, who was to take to the 
airwaves Thursday night on WABC's Yankee Talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the first lady was all smiles as Yankees shortstop  
Derek Jeter presented her with a team pendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Her appearance at the White House Yankees festivities cast the  
feel-good event in a decidedly political light against the backdrop 
of her Senate ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials insisted it was just a coincidence that  
the event to honor the Yankees -- who won the Series almost eight 
months ago -- had come just as the first lady prepared to form an 
exploratory committee for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee noted the first lady had  
shunned similar White House sports fetes in the past. RNC chairman 
Jim Nicholson called the World Series festivities ``a cynical use 
of the Yankees and a tacky insult to the intelligence of every true 
Yankees fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an appearance on NBC's ``Today'' show on Thursday, the first  
lady pledged her allegiance to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is I've always been a Yankees fan,'' she said. ``As a  
young girl I became very interested and enamored of the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the first lady, who lived for years in Arkansas and hails  
from Illinois, was asked about the Chicago Cubs, she said she still 
roots for them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a Cubs fan. But I needed an American League team because  
when you're from Chicago you cannot root for both the Cubs and the 
(White) Sox,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She is such a big enough Cubs fan to be listed as a member of  
the Emil Verban Society, a Chicago Cubs fan club based in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her NBA allegiance, she is firmly behind New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm a Knicks fan, absolutely,'' she told reporters outside  
an East Harlem school early Thursday, the day after the Knicks 
upset the Indiana Pacers to take a 3-2 lead in their best-of-7 
Eastern Conference final.

<HEADLINE> N.Korean Soccer Players Meet Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCAFEE, N.J. (AP) -- Dressed in bright red team jackets or in  
three-piece suits, the advisers, technical directors and translator 
for the North Korea women's soccer team could have been at a trial. 
They answered questions readily, but without revealing anything 
noteworthy. They seemed anxious to finish with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	In the background, the 20 players chatted as they took off their  
warmups and prepared for a workout at the Ballyowen Field, hard by 
the first hole of the year-old Ballyowen golf course. Then they 
stretched, jogged a lap -- and headed straight through the 
sprinklers watering the grass. Their giggles and shenanigans while 
trying to see who could force the other to get most wet drew smiles 
from reporters, if not from Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is any pressure on the players of the most mysterious  
team in the Women's World Cup, it's difficult to sense. They seem 
to be having a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that they will admit it when asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been here six days, and our prime task is to qualify  
for the Olympics in Sydney,'' said captain Kim Kum Sil, the lone 
player made available for interviews Thursday at the only media 
session team officials planned to allow. North Korea must make the 
quarterfinals to have a shot at the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things have changed, such as the time change. We are  
having jet lag and we still are not accustomed to the climate 
change,'' she said. ``We are trying to get accustomed to them and 
the things we can concentrate on as soon possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That shouldn't be very difficult, considering the way they are  
being sheltered. Then again, for a nation whose athletes rarely 
travel outside of Asia, that's an understandable approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not distract the players,'' said Ryu Song Il,  
secretary-general of the North Korean Olympic Committee, when asked 
if the players would be mingling with Korean-Americans during the 
tournament. ``Doing any kind of activities that might affect 
players while they are conditioning and training is not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans head for Los Angeles this weekend, where they will  
practice leading up to their tournament opener against Nigeria on 
June 20. They play Denmark in Portland, Ore., on June 24, then face 
the host Americans on June 27 in Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Although little is known about them, they have limited  
experience on the world stage and have not been a soccer power in 
previous years, the Koreans remain confident they can advance to 
the second round, if not further. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time our country is attempting the Women's  
World Cup,'' technical director Kim Hak-Yong said. ``Women's soccer 
was not started long ago in my country, but it has gained a strong 
reputation so far. I think my team will play as a good, strong team 
this time. How we play against strong teams will demonstrate how 
we've prepared for this World Cup.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Works on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats on a key House  
committee agreed Thursday to begin working on a compromise to 
safeguard Social Security, a sign that efforts to overhaul the 
retirement program are not dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said  
the panel would hold a series of meetings behind closed doors ``to 
discuss areas of common ground'' and possibly prepare a draft bill 
for further action. 
</P>
<P>
	In an impassioned speech to the committee, the Texas Republican  
said both political parties must put aside partisan considerations 
to ensure that Social Security remains solvent as the huge baby 
boom generation retires. The program is healthy now, but faces 
insolvency by 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can prove that a democracy can address a difficult problem  
far ahead of the drop-dead date,'' Archer said. ``We can prove, 
perhaps for the first time, that we don't have to wait until we're 
at the edge of the cliff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's top Democrat, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
agreed that private committee sessions would be the only way to 
``find out not how far apart we are, but how close are we?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would enhance the respect and support of both Democrats and  
Republicans ... if we could come together in a bipartisan way,'' 
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said President  
Clinton commended Archer and Rangel for ``working in a constructive 
way'' on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a vast contrast to some of the other Republican leaders  
who have pronounced Social Security reform ... dead for the year 
for political reasons,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides still face long odds in reaching agreement on fixing  
Social Security, traditionally one of the most sensitive political 
issues. Clinton has proposed a plan that not all Democrats embrace, 
and GOP leaders haven't endorsed an alternative developed by Archer 
and Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Multiple political considerations complicate any attempt at  
compromise, including control of the House in 2000 and Vice 
President Al Gore's campaign for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats believe that cooperating with Republicans to fix  
Social Security only enhances the GOP in voters' eyes, while 
Republicans worry they could be hammered by Clinton and the 
Democrats if they push their own overhaul plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has encouraged the  
Ways and Means Committee to move forward. And Archer met last week 
with the House Democratic leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt of 
Missouri, and assured him that Democrats would be not be left out 
as legislation is developed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they're not talking about dismantling the program,  
we're willing to look at ways to reach a workable solution,'' said 
Gephardt spokeswoman Laura Nichols.

<HEADLINE> Canoeist's Profanity Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- A man went on trial Thursday on charges  
he shouted a blue streak in front of women and children when he was 
dumped from his canoe on the Rifle River. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Joseph Boomer, 25, faces a possible 90 days in jail and  
a $100 fine if convicted of violating an 1897 law that bans 
profanity in the presence of women and children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about criminalizing ordinary, day-to-day speech  
-- language that just about everybody in the country has used 
personally from time to time,'' said defense attorney William 
Street, handling the case on behalf of the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer does not deny he let off steam, but said he didn't see  
anyone but his friends and that his shouts were in jest. He denies 
using the four-letter obscenities that police allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer, a factory worker from the Detroit suburb of Roseville,  
was with a group of friends last August on the river about 130 
miles north of Detroit when his canoe hit a rock. 
</P>
<P>
	He tumbled out and yelled a series of obscenities within earshot  
of a woman and children in another boat, said former sheriff's 
Deputy Kenneth Socia, who was patrolling the river and ticketed 
Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone should be able to have a good time on the river, and  
it shouldn't be (disrupted) ... by other people intoxicated, 
swearing,'' Socia testified Thursday. ``I'm sitting there writing a 
ticket, and he's yelling at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police began patrolling the river last summer after  
representatives of campgrounds, liveries and property owners 
complained that drunken, rowdy boaters were getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladd White, a local businessman said he hoped Boomer would be  
convicted so people realize that morals and respect are still 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's been the downfall of societies in the past. Maybe this  
will send a message that morality does matter,'' White said.

	Serb Troops Leaving Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav troops began to rumble out  
of Kosovo in trucks, armored cars and buses Thursday, prompting 
NATO to suspend its punishing 78-day air war and the United Nations 
to authorize a heavily armed security force to restore peace and 
begin reconstruction. NATO troops massed in neighboring Macedonia 
to begin the peacekeeping mission, with the first soldiers ready to 
enter Kosovo as early as Friday. The force would also ensure the 
safe return of 860,000 refugees driven from their homes. 

</P>

	Clinton Claims Victory in Air War  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton claimed victory in the NATO  
air war against Yugoslavia today as American ground troops moved 
toward Kosovo to protect the return home of ethnic Albanian 
refugees. ``We have to finish the job and build the peace,'' he 
said. Euphoria swept through the White House at the successful 
conclusion of an 11-week conflict that had brought biting criticism 
and doubts about Clinton's handling of the showdown with Yugoslav 
leader Slobodan Milosevic. Clinton said the Serb retreat was a 
vindication for America's fighting forces. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton, GOP Reach Deal on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House gave divided blessings today to a  
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo after Republicans extracted a 
written promise from President Clinton that it could be performed 
``without harming military readiness.'' On a 270-155 vote, the 
House removed from a $288.8 billion defense spending bill a 
GOP-drafted provision that would have barred U.S. funds from being 
used in Kosovo after Sept. 30. The vote came moments after Clinton 
promised to seek congressional authorization for an international 
peacekeeping force expected to include 7,000 Americans.

	New Air Bags May Fail Crash Test  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's three largest automakers say  
their latest, less forceful air bags -- designed to reduce injuries 
to small adults and children -- cannot pass a proposed government 
crash test standard that the automakers say is too tough. Federal 
safety officials have proposed reinstating a crash test standard 
that requires an air bag to cushion an unbelted dummy when a 
vehicle is driven into a wall at 30 mph. But the automakers argue 
that air bags will have to be made more powerful again which will 
increase the chances that children and short adults will be injured 
in all types of crashes.

breast cancer. But obesity -- among children especially -- has 
reached epidemic proportions, the surgeon general said today. 
Overall, the health of Americans has improved in the decade since 
the government released its Healthy People 2000 goals -- a blueprint

genetic pattern could be complete by 2002, a year earlier than last 
predicted. Researchers around the world trying to catalog all of 
the 60,000 to 90,000 genes in human DNA are making rapid progress 
that could bump up the completion date. Identifying all the human 
genes will make it possible to treat or prevent cancer, inherited

	Dow Ends Down 69.02

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as good economic news for  
Japan increased Wall Street's fears that the unfettered growth of 
the U.S. economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates. At the close, the Dow industrials were down 69.02 at 
10,621.27. Declining issues on the NYSE outnumbered advances

	Is Another Comeback in the Stars?  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are used to making comebacks in  
playoff games; now they'll try to do it in a series. Trailing 1-0 
in the Stanley Cup finals, the Stars face another test in their 
postseason adventure story when they meet the Buffalo Sabres 
tonight in Game 2 at Reunion Arena. The Stars have made a habit of 
comebacks in the postseason, rallying to win five times when 
trailing at some point in the third period. That has tied an NHL 
record.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 7.51 percent this week, the highest 
level in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been rising for the past two months and now  
stand nearly a percentage point above their low for the year of 
6.74 percent at the end of January. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Orioles-Cuba Game Abuses Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Gov. Parris Glendening has requested an  
investigation into complaints of human rights abuses during the 
game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart wrote Glendening last  
month that ``abusive tactics were used to suppress the freedom of 
expression of numerous spectators'' during the game at Camden Yards 
on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendening wrote to Diaz-Balart on May 27, saying he would ask  
that Bruce Hoffman, executive director of the Maryland Stadium 
Authority, work with the Orioles to investigate the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz-Balart wrote that several Cuban-American activists had told  
him that stadium personnel and police ``were instructed to prevent 
Cuban-Americans from displaying banners or chanting between 
innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter says a group known as Mothers and Women Against  
Repression were approached numerous times during the game. They 
were told their banners and flags would be confiscated and they 
would be ejected from the stadium if they continued to display them 
and chant between innings. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Cuban umpire threw an anti-Castro protester to the  
ground, the women were again approached by security. Several of the 
women were forced from the stadium and two were threatened with 
mace when they questioned police, the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
	It says spectators who were part of the Cuban delegation were  
allowed to chant without being issued warnings.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Curbs Out-of-Court Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court limited the use during  
criminal trials of out-of-court statements by alleged accomplices 
who admit some wrongdoing but try to blame the defendant for the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's divided ruling Thursday revived a Virginia death row  
inmate's challenge of his conviction for shooting a man to death 
during a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Lee Lilly says his conviction was invalid because  
prosecutors were allowed to tell jurors his brother, Mark, admitted 
some involvement in the crime to police but blamed the killing on 
Lilly. Mark Lilly refused to testify during his brother's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the court's main opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the  
use of Mark Lilly's confession during Lilly's trial violated his 
constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lilly's confession could not be considered ``sufficiently  
reliable as to be admissible without allowing (Lilly) to 
cross-examine him,'' Stevens wrote, adding that Lilly's brother 
``had a natural motive to attempt to exculpate himself as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision appeared to break little new ground. Stevens also  
noted the court previously has ruled accomplices' statements that 
shift blame to a defendant generally are not considered so 
trustworthy they can be used in court without cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Willis of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia  
said, ``The Supreme Court is simply re-embracing one of the 
fundamental principles of criminal justice, and that is the right 
to face your accuser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All nine justices voted to reverse the Virginia Supreme Court's  
decision that upheld Lilly's conviction. The justices also ordered 
a lower court to determine whether the error could be considered 
harmless and Lilly's conviction still could be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices split on their rationale.  
</P>
<P>
	Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.  
Breyer agreed with Stevens that accomplices' confessions that 
incriminate a defendant generally cannot be used as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia agreed the constitutional violation in Lilly's case was  
``clear'' but did not join the main opinion's rationale. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day  
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas said the 
Constitution did not create a blanket ban on the use of 
accomplices' confessions that incriminate a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles L. Hobson of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation,  
which supported Virginia prosecutors in the case, called the ruling 
``a poor decision that reflects the current confusion about the 
confrontation clause'' in the Constitution's Sixth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly was convicted of the 1995 shooting death of Alexander  
DeFilippis at a rural convenience store near Heathwood, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Lilly shot DeFilippis during a carjacking. At  
Lilly's trial, co-defendant Gary Wayne Barker testified against him 
and said Lilly fired the fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lilly, who was charged in connection with the carjacking,  
refused to testify based on his Fifth Amendment privilege against 
self-incrimination. But prosecutors were allowed to tell jurors 
about Mark Lilly's confession to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia Supreme Court ruled the confession could be used.  
It should be considered reliable, the state court said, because 
Mark Lilly spoke against his own interest and because it was 
supported by Barker's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court said the Virginia court was wrong.

<HEADLINE> Man Wins $234M Suit Against Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A family of Russian descent seeking return of  
property seized after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution won a $234 
million judgment against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David Hittner awarded the damages Tuesday  
after Russia failed to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Magness' claim was based on his family's vast holdings in  
St. Petersburg, Russia, including a piano factory, a shopping 
center and a mansion. All were absorbed by the communists after the 
1917 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fall of communism, the Russian government prohibited  
the nationalization or expropriation of foreign investments, 
prompting the plaintiffs to travel to St. Petersburg in 1994 to 
reclaim the family fortune once owned by Magness' maternal 
grandfather, Ivan Karlovitch Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
	``For whatever reason, the Russian Federation and Ministry of  
Culture claimed the property was not (the Magness'),'' family 
attorney Daniel B. Nelson. ``The expropriation we're really suing 
over occurred in 1994.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government claimed the Schroder properties, including two  
expensive vintage pianos Magness tried to buy when he was there, 
were national treasures, the lawsuit stated. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to get the Russians to take notice, the Magness  
family sued here in 1997 to get the court to prevent a $100 million 
Romanov jewel exhibit from leaving Houston. The family wanted the 
exhibit held as collateral for its alleged debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia objected, then stopped defending itself once the tour  
moved on to San Diego. Hittner issued a default judgment Nov. 20 
after hearing evidence only from the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Embassy spokesman Mikhail A. Shurgalin and the Russian  
Federation's attorney on the case, Tim Dickinson, did not return 
calls by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Court Sets Aside Media Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has reversed its ruling  
that ordered NBC television to turn over a videotape that was made 
but never used in a story about Louisiana state police. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape, made for an NBC ``Dateline'' segment, was demanded by  
lawyers for a Hispanic couple who are suing a Louisiana deputy 
sheriff, alleging civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals had ruled in September that NBC  
had to hand over the videotape, which shows an officer pulling over 
a car. NBC was investigating whether police were acting based on 
race, nationality or out-of-state plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for NBC argued the First Amendment provided qualified  
privilege on material reporters get from nonconfidential sources. 
The court found otherwise, and the ruling was seen as making it 
easier for lawyers to obtain unpublished notes and videotapes from 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court vacated its ruling June 1, saying it may need to  
rehear the issue. It instructed lower court judges to stop using 
the September ruling as a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to further illumination of the issue  
from the Court of Appeals,'' said Susan Weiner, a lawyer for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly from the journalist's perspective, the law in the  
circuit prior to this decision has appeared to recognize greater 
protection for journalist's work products, notes and tapes,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists have already reaped a benefit from the June 1 order.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the appeals court vacated a contempt finding  
involving The Wall Street Journal that was based on the September 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, a lower court judge refused to let Dow Jones &AMP;  
Co., publisher of the Journal, quash a subpoena for a reporter's 
notes. The subpoena was lodged by defendants in a securities action 
brought by stockholders of Centennial Technologies Inc.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Rails Against New $20 Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Multimillionaire Steve Forbes is adding a new  
plank to his campaign platform, pledging that if he is elected 
president, ``We will have money that looks real again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 100 members of the Greater Des Moines Chamber  
of Commerce meeting in Washington, Forbes railed against the new 
$20 bills, which he said ``look like Monopoly money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that's going to change when a certain person  
leaves the White House,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Commerce group, which represents 2,100 businesses  
in central Iowa, is a crucial constituency to Forbes' second bid 
for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks Thursday centered on his plan to rescue Social  
Security funds from politicians ``who want to put their paws on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eliciting the only applause of his 20-minute speech, Forbes  
evoked the same bears-to-honey imagery he used in the first 
installment of a $10 million television advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans, he said, should be able to invest up to three-fourths  
of their Social Security taxes in private accounts, out of the 
reach of politicians in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should show some compassion,'' he said to applause. ``Don't  
tempt these creatures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and other candidates are pushing the Social Security  
theme in a battle for the growing pot of voters over 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show that elderly voters are richer, better educated, more  
mobile, more likely to vote and increasingly more Republican than 
30 years ago. Though President Clinton won the over-60 vote in 1992 
and 1996, seniors voted Republican 54 percent to 43 percent in the 
1998 midterm elections.

<HEADLINE> Intel Plans Faster Chip Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest  
computer chip maker, will soon produce its chips faster and cheaper 
-- a move that could force the entire industry to change its 
manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said today it will add 12-inch silicon wafers to its  
chip-production process in 2002, which is expected to cut 
high-volume chip manufacturing costs by 30 percent. The current 
industry standard is an 8-inch wafer. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon wafers are sliced into individual semiconductor chips.  
Enlarging the surface size of the wafer will allow more chips to be 
made at one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, is investing $1.2 billion to make  
its Hillsboro, Ore., plant compatible with the larger wafer size. 
Equipment installation is set to begin next year, the company said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Moore, Intel chairman emeritus, said in today's edition  
of The Wall Street Journal that deployment of the 12-inch wafer is 
likely to result in the ``largest industrial retooling in 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sematech, an industry consortium, estimates the retooling cost  
at between $14 billion to $30 billion, according to the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens AG and Motorola Inc. are also building a plant in  
Germany to produce larger silicon wafers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new manufacturing process, Intel also will switch to a  
copper-based chip technology that will overcome resistance problems 
and create faster chips, the company said.

<HEADLINE> New Air Bags May Fail Crash Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's three largest automakers say  
their latest, less forceful air bags -- designed to reduce injuries 
to small adults and children -- cannot pass a proposed government 
crash test standard that the automakers say is too tough. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposes  
reinstating a crash test standard that requires an air bag to 
cushion an unbelted dummy when a vehicle is driven into a wall at 
30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal safety officials believe reinstating the old test  
standard will make air bags more effective and safer in high-speed 
or severe crashes for unbelted adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But the automakers argue that, in order to meet the 30-mph test,  
air bags will have to be made more powerful again which will 
increase the chances that children and short adults will be injured 
in all types of crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags have been blamed for 135 deaths -- mostly to children  
and shorter women -- in low-speed accidents the victims otherwise 
should have survived, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Government data also shows less than 1 percent of crashes  
involve a change of speed of 30 mph or greater. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. officials said Thursday that they ran the  
30-mph test with one of their vehicles and the newer, less powerful 
air bag failed to adequately cushion the unbelted crash dummy. A 
Ford Motor Co. official says the company performed similar tests 
with the same result while DaimlerChrysler has said for months its 
less-powerful air bags on Chrysler and Dodge vehicles could fail 
the proposed government standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, all three automakers installed air bags with 25  
percent to 35 percent less force. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's proposed 30-mph unbelted test ``would simply take  
us back to where we were before, and we know we don't like that 
outcome,'' said Bob Lange, GM's director of engineering safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we add too much energy (to the air bag), we create the  
potential to severely injure people who would have been essentially 
injury free,'' Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is not convinced that automakers need to add more  
power to air bags to comply with the test, which was a government 
standard until early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The test ``is necessary to insure protection for people in the  
real world in the most difficult crashes,'' said NHTSA spokesman 
Rae Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA has tested 12 vehicles with redesigned air bags and found  
that only two would not have met the test standard, the Dodge Neon 
and the Acura RL. The agency also said the tests showed 
``manufacturer redesign of air bags has resulted in slightly 
reduced protection of large adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the agency and automakers agree the new air bags reduce the  
risk they posed to smaller passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers believe the less powerful air bags are doing a good  
job protecting adults in severe crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lange said he has not seen any crash reports that indicate the  
so-called depowered air bags are not powerful enough to cushion 
adults in higher-speed crashes. Other automakers agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that depowered air bags provide very good  
protection in severe crashes,'' Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers already must comply with a 30-mph vehicle crash test  
into a wall using dummies wearing seat belts, and they agree that 
test is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lange calls the test for unbelted dummies ``an extremely  
severe test'' that could force automakers into air bag designs that 
sacrifice safety for smaller passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in the real world, the test translates into the  
unbelted driver of a Dodge Neon ramming the back of a parked Dodge 
Neon at 60 mph, or two Dodge Neons hitting each other head-on with 
each car traveling at 30 mph.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Olympic Gun Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A pistol said to have been given to IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch by Salt Lake City organizers is 
among those drawing the attention of federal investigators trying 
to determine if the shipment of the weapons was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The engraved 9mm high-power pistol made by Browning Arms Co. of  
Mountain Green, Utah, is in the International Olympic Committee 
museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The pistol was sold to Salt Lake organizers in 1991, according  
to Rich Bauter, Browning vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no way of knowing who got the gun. The Salt Lake  
Tribune reported Wednesday it was given to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics investigation into  
the scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games found that Samaranch 
received a limited edition pistol donated by Browning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauter said the guns weren't donated, but as many as 10 were  
sold at cost to organizers ``because we wanted to help bring the 
Olympics to Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Samaranch -- or someone else -- sent the pistol back to  
Lausanne or it was shipped by organizers remains unclear. Either 
way, the transfer may have violated federal weapons laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department is required to approve shipments of weapons  
leaving the country. Violators could be charged under federal law 
with felony exportation of a firearm without a permit, ATF 
spokesman Larry Bettendorf told The Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, it was disclosed that Samaranch received firearms  
worth at least $2,000 as gifts during Salt Lake City's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. At the time, it was reported that the 
IOC chief had received two rifles and a shotgun, all made by 
Browning, and possibly a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he didn't want to insult Salt Lake City by  
refusing the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I travel I get gifts,'' Samaranch said in January.  
``Of course Utah, Salt Lake City, is a state where guns are very 
popular. I have visited Salt Lake City twice and I got a gun both 
times. I took it to Switzerland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits unlicensed dealers from exporting firearms  
from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said, ``We  
are not aware that this is an issue,'' and declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian IOC member Mario Pescante said today the controversy  
over the guns was part of an organized campaign in the United 
States against Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it very strange that this campaign starts at the very  
moment that Samaranch finds the right way to resolve our 
problems,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, SLOC's vice-president of communications, said  
she ``has no clue'' how the guns got to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee, being a separate entity, and with the  
Department of Justice investigating, we have no access to any of 
those kinds of records,'' she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the SLOC's attorneys have not been contacted by  
investigators regarding the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel refused to discuss the  
case, saying only that the department ``continues investigating 
allegations of impropriety in connection with the Salt Lake City 
bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Bukovac, agent in charge of the Salt Lake City office of  
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, confirmed that ``we 
have done some interviews'' regarding the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF is among the federal agencies participating in the  
Justice Department's investigation of lavish treatment, gifts, and 
cash payments given to IOC officials during Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauter said federal agents touched on the gun shipments in an  
interview with Browning officials earlier this year. He said the 
meeting dealt with guns sold to organizers over a period dating 
back to Salt Lake's first Olympic bid.

	Yugoslavia, NATO Sign Kosovo Deal  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes,  
Yugoslav forces prepare to withdraw from Kosovo today as part of a 
peace deal signed by Yugoslav and Western generals to end the war 
over Kosovo. U.S. Marines in amphibious vehicles landed on the 
shores of northern Greece today, part of a vanguard force ready to 
enter Kosovo to bring peace to the province that 860,000 ethnic 
Albanians have fled since March. In the Yugoslav capital of 
Belgrade, residents honked car horns and set off firecrackers to

	Russian Premier Warns Lawmakers  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin warned lawmakers  
today that he might threaten their jobs if they failed to approve a 
package of economic austerity bills. Stepashin said he might call a 
confidence vote in his new Cabinet. If lawmakers vote 
no-confidence, then President Boris Yeltsin could disband the lower 
house, the State Duma, and call new elections -- a prospect 
lawmakers want to avoid. Communist and hard-line lawmakers, fearing 
a backlash from the public, have been resisting quick action on a 
series of bills that would introduce new taxes.

	Brain Damage-Cancer Defense Linked  
</P>
<P>
	Testicular cancer can lead to seizures, memory loss and dementia  
long before the cancer is detected, researchers reported today in 
the third study to link brain damage to an immune system attack on 
cancer. The brain damage apparently is caused not by the cancer 
itself, but by an overly aggressive attack by body's own immune 
system on a protein produced by tumors, the researchers said. In 
today's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers said men with 
testicular cancer and damage to one of the brain's emotional 
centers had a particular type of antibody in their blood.

	New Drugs Blamed in 'Sleep Attacks'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two new drugs for Parkinson's disease may  
cause narcolepsy-like ``sleep attacks,'' according to doctors who 
say eight of their patients were in auto accidents after the drugs 
abruptly put them to sleep. The Food and Drug Administration is 
talking with the manufacturers about whether the drugs need 
additional warning labels. Dr. Steven Frucht of 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, who reported the 
eight cases in the journal Neurology, said Parkinson's patients 
should not overreact to the warning and stop taking the drugs, 
which can be very helpful for treating Parkinson's symptoms.

	Pope Emphasizes Christian Unity

<P>
	SIEDLCE, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II will meet today with  
Orthodox Christians during a trip to eastern Poland. Orthodox 
Christian Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have been 
separated since the Great Schism in 1054 in a dispute over papal 
authority and interpretation of their creed. The dispute is rooted 
in a decision by Emperor Constantine in 330 to move the capital of 
the Roman Empire to Byzantium, later Constantinople. John Paul, the 
head of the Roman Catholic Church, is emphasizing Christian unity 
and religious pluralism during his 13-day pilgrimage to his 
homeland.

	Slow Count Arouses Suspicion in Indonesia

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police tightened security around  
Jakarta today as a slow election vote count aroused anxiety that 
Indonesia's long tradition of vote-rigging was again plaguing the 
country. Election officials denied any improprieties, saying they 
have been swamped by the 113 million votes cast in Monday's 
parliamentary election, billed as the country's most democratic 
vote in 44 years. By today, unofficial results released to 
journalists showed that 8.2 percent of the votes had been 
tabulated, a fraction of what had been promised.

<HEADLINE> Ralston Purina To Spin Off Eveready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ralston Purina Co. plans to spin off its  
Eveready Battery Co. Inc. subsidiary to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston Purina, based in St. Louis, is composed of Ralston  
Purina Pet Products, a dog and cat food manufacturer, and Eveready, 
which produces dry cell batteries and flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff, which gives shareholders of Ralston Purina new  
tax-free shares of Eveready Battery Company, will take about seven 
to 10 months to complete, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will depend on a favorable tax ruling by the Internal  
Revenue Service and a final approval by the Ralston Purina board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, Ralston Purina co-CEO J. Patrick Mulcahy, has  
resigned from his position to focus more on the battery company. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Patrick McGinnis, who served as co-CEO with Mulcahy, has been  
named CEO of the company.

<HEADLINE> Parents, Kids Dead in Murder-Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A woman stabbed her husband to death  
and wounded their 8-year-old daughter before setting fire to the 
family home today, killing herself and two younger children. 
</P>
<P>
	The older girl escaped with stab wounds, while a fourth child,  
an infant, suffered severe burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief James Shay said firefighters called to the home  
around 1:15 a.m. found the bodies of Charles Silk, 39; his 
32-year-old wife, Kelly; and two of their children, Jennifer, 3, 
and Jonah, 2. The toddlers probably died of smoke inhalation, the 
chief said; Mrs. Silk's body was badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters also found 6-month-old Joshua, who had been  
severely burned. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital in 
Boston, where he was in serious condition, spokeswoman Victoria 
Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest child, Jessica, had fled to a neighbor's home after  
being stabbed by her mother. She was in serious condition at 
Connecticut Children's Medical Center, spokesman Chris Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shay said Mrs. Silk had a history of mental problems. In May  
last year, police were called to the home after Mrs. Silk overdosed 
on a drug and was taken to a hospital. Authorities had no details.

<HEADLINE> Coke Recalls 2.5M Bottles in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co.'s Belgian branch recalled  
2.5 million bottles of Coca-Cola after several children fell ill 
after drinking the the popular beverage at school. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, 31 pupils in northern Belgium were hospitalized  
after drinking from Coca-Cola bottles that came from a batch of 2.5 
million bottles produced last week in Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysis by the company found that some of the bottles had a  
quality defect, which can lead to symptoms such as headaches, 
nausea and stomach cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a quality issue where you have an off odor or taste,  
which you can get from consuming one or more Cokes,'' Coca-Cola 
spokeswoman Maureen O'Sullivan said Thursday. ``But there was no 
intoxication found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a safety precaution, Coca-Cola has blocked all the bottles at  
point of sale and is presently trying to recall all the bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Sullivan said that the incident at a school on Bornem appears  
to be an isolated case but added ``we're taking this seriously, we 
want to avoid any risks for our consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soft drink company dispatched a team of researchers to the  
school on Tuesday after several students were hospitalized after 
drinking Coca-Cola with their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Samples of the bottles were then sent to Coca-Cola laboratories  
in Brussels and Atlanta, as well as to an independent team in the 
Netherlands. O'Sullivan said the scientists, who will be running 
several tests, have found no traces of toxins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors confirmed our tests, nothing could be found in the  
blood samples,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has been active in Belgium for the past  
70 years and has large bottling operations in Antwerp and Ghent. 
The U.S. company's European headquarters are also based in 
Brussels.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower. The Dow Jones

<HEADLINE> Rubin Pushes Europe, Japan on Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While saying that the risks of a global  
recession have diminished, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin stressed 
today that it still is ``critically important'' for Japan and 
Europe to do everything possible to boost economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said a Saturday meeting of finance ministers of the  
world's seven richest industrial countries would focus on 
coordinating strategies to promote growth as well as prepare the 
financial agenda for next week's annual economic summit meeting of 
leaders of the seven nations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and the leaders of Japan, Germany, France,  
Britain, Italy and Canada are expected to endorse actions already 
under way to promote greater disclosure of financial data by 
developing countries so foreign investors are not taken by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	But the package of measures is expected to fall far short of  
some of the sweeping proposals for overhaul of the global financial 
architecture in the wake of a currency crisis that plunged 
one-third of the world into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Market turbulence last fall after Russia defaulted on billions  
of dollars of foreign loans sent stock prices crashing around the 
world and raised concerns of a global recession. However, the 
Federal Reserve stepped in and engineered a series of interest rate 
cuts that restored investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the risk of a global recession stemming from the  
Asian currency crisis is now ``substantially diminished'' from what 
it had been last fall. But there is no room for complacency, he 
added, especially since the United States has the only major 
economy performing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin cautioned against reading too much into recent signs that  
Japan may finally be emerging from its worst recession in 50 years. 
He said both Japan and Europe, where growth has slowed, need to 
continue pursuing growth policies, in part to help relieve pressure 
on a soaring U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``critically important that Europe and Japan do their part  
because the international system cannot sustain indefinitely the 
large imbalances created by the disparities in growth and openness 
between the United States and its major trading partners,'' Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin had expressed worries during a speech Wednesday that  
America's record trade deficits were spawning rising protectionist 
pressures that if unleashed could harm not only the U.S. economy 
but the fragile global recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the Bretton Woods Committee, Rubin echoed many of  
the points made by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan during 
two recent addresses in which he also decried an increase of 
protectionist sentiment being spawned by record U.S. trade 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said last week that free trade had raised living  
standards around the world and efforts to erect new barriers could 
do ``great harm'' to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he was particularly concerned about a drive in  
Congress to impose quotas on foreign steel shipments into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the proposal, which passed the House by a 2-1 margin in  
March, threatened to set off a devastating chain-reaction of trade 
protectionism in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steel companies have argued that they need the stiff quotas  
to prevent thousands of American layoffs. But the administrations 
contends the bill clearly violates global trading rules 
administered by the World Trade Organization and would trigger 
copycat protectionist moves by other countries against American 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``That bill could well pass the Senate, and such action in the  
strongest major economy in the world creates a real risk of 
strengthening the already increased protectionist pressure being 
felt around the world,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who support the steel quota  
measure, said Rubin needs to understand that ``free trade does not 
mean free to subsidize, free to dump or free to distort the market. 
Ohio Valley steel has suffered long enough from dumping. Senate 
action is long overdue.''
