<HEADLINE> World Environment Day Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Environment Ministry has set a slogan for the day: "2000,
The Environment Millennium: Time to Act." To mark the Day, the
ministry organized a rally and a procession in the morning, a fair
and a discussion in the afternoon, and a cultural function in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is grappling with arsenic contamination of ground
water and air, river, land and sound pollution. Government
officials openly admitted that the concept of environment itself
is a new addition to the human development programs of the country.
They said they are yet to take professional measures to address
the problems.
</P>
<P>
However, changes are taking place in the country. Civil
societies all over the country have formed groups to disseminate
environment-related messages to the people. Government and non-
governmental organizations are increasingly bound to assess
environmental impact of all their development projects.
</P>
<P>
Now there will be one single focus -- to grow awareness among
the people for whom protecting environment has become a life-and-
death issue.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the World Environment Day, President
Shahabuddin Ahmed called for all concerned to play an active role
in creating mass awareness about the harms of environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
"The world community should unitedly face the environmental
problem caused by various facts, including greenhouse effect,
depletion of ozone layer, climate change, desertification, sea-
level rise and global warming," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing hope for the growing public awareness of the
environment across the world, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said
Bangladesh is equally vocal at regional and international levels
like other nations of the world for protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Our government is relentlessly trying to protect the
environment and has signed various eco-friendly international
protocols and agreements," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht to Regain Strength This Week: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht tends to regain its
strength this week, as international rating agencies are
reportedly moving to upgrade their credit rating to Thailand, a
senior bank official said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ekaratana Suwannava, head of the Department of Currency Trade
of DBS Thai Danu Bank, said in a report that the Thai currency is
appreciating to around 38.88 to 38.91 against U.S. dollar, up from
over 39 baht a dollar over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The positive trend resulted from moves by international rating
agencies to upgrade their credit rating to the Thai economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend of the Thai baht also resulted from stronger
currencies in the Asian region, namely the Singapore dollar and
the Japanese yen, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Thai Senate to Perform Duty Before June 24: Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Election Commission has
expressed its confidence that the full 200-seat Senate will be
ready to perform its duty before the reconvention of the House of
Representatives on June 24.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in an announcement Monday that since they
had received few complaints on frauds and forms of vote buying in
Sunday's third round of senatorial election, it believed that the
complete 200-seat Senate could officially start to perform its
duties before June 24, the scheduled date for reconvention of the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission said that there might be the fourth
round senatorial poll in some provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's third round senatorial election, whose official
results are expected by June 8, was to fill in the remaining 12
seats of the Senate, as winners of the past two polls were
suspended by the Election Commission due to evidences of their
irregular practices.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches Initiative for FTA With Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Canada will begin
exploring the possibility of negotiating a bilateral free trade
agreement (FTA) between them, Singapore Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MTI) said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo and Canadian
International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew announced the
initiative in Darwin, Australia, on the sidelines of the Meeting
of APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade, MTI said.
</P>
<P>
The Canada-Singapore FTA will be the second FTA initiative
Singapore is launching with countries across the Pacific Ocean.
George Yeo recently announced that FTA negotiations with Mexico
would commence in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yeo was quoted as saying in an interview following his meeting
with Pettigrew that a FTA would send a strong signal to
Singaporeans on the future prospects of further developing links
between the two countries in trade, investment, science and
technology, culture, education and people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
He was also quoted as affirming that the proposed Canada-
Singapore FTA will help bring both sides of the Pacific closer
together.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that the exploration with
Canada will lead to the launch of negotiations later in the year
and, bit by bit, will bring both sides of the Pacific together to
achieve APEC's Bogor vision of free trade and investments by 2010
for developed economies and 2020 for all economies, MTI added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unaffected by Earthquake in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Concerned authorities of
Singapore announced that no building in the country was affected
by the tremor arising from the earthquake off the Indonesian
island of Sumatra in early morning Monday.
</P>
<P>
A press release jointly issued Monday by Singapore's Building
and Construction Authority (BCA) and Housing Development Board (
HDB) said that BCA have visually inspected the buildings that were
reportedly affected by the tremor and the inspections did not
reveal any structural damage and there is no reported damage to
the infrastructure such as roads and bridges, and electrical and
communication service.
</P>
<P>
HDB engineers carried out the inspections to 90 HDB apartment
blocks in estates in areas where residents reported that they felt
tremors in their blocks and the results of the inspections show
that the blocks are structurally "sound and safe," it added.
</P>
<P>
The powerful earthquake off Sumatra, measured 7.9 on Richter
scale with epicenter 112 kilometer off the city of Bengkulu on the
west coast of Sumatra, has been felt in Singapore with hundreds of
residents leaving their high rise homes in various parts of the
island.
</P>
<P>
The police and the Civil Defense Force received 600 to 700
calls but no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The press release underlined that Singapore is located in a
stable geological formation and is situated more than 400
kilometers from the Indonesian earthquake belt.
</P>
<P>
At such a distance, large earthquakes in Indonesia would cause
minor vibrations or tremors to buildings in Singapore, it said,
assuring that the low-level vibrations would not be significant
enough to cause structural damage or affect the structural
integrity of the buildings.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Set up Modern Price Data Base System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
establish a modern price data base system early next year to
provide accurate information on evaluation of imports for both
customs officials and importers, a senior official said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commissioner for Customs Theo Lyimo told a five-day
workshop on price date base design and World Trade Organization
regulations that the new system will give importers detailed
classification lists on the determined values of cargo.
</P>
<P>
"Various transit ports at borders will computerize their
operations for the establishment of price data base system which
will be updated every three months to keep abreast with the
changing patterns of imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Imports evaluation by the new system will be more accurate and
transparent than the existing system, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no action or decision can be taken by
government agencies without a thorough knowledge and mastery of
the new fundamentals of international business.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has been obliged to meet the challenges created by
new economic turbulence in increased investment and human resource
training," he said, adding that "the establishing of a
comprehensive price data base is therefore crucial in securing the
revenue."
</P>
<P>
When asked when the new price data base system will become
fully operational, the customs deputy commissioner said that it
will be in place by January next year if preparations go as
planned.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Board of the World Bank
Group on Tuesday agreed to support the highly controversial Chad-
Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement it would lend 39.5 million U.S.
dollars to Chad and 53.4 million dollars to Cameroon to help build
a 1,070 kilometer pipeline to carry oil from the Doba field in
southern Chad to loading facilities off Cameroon's Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the International Finance Corporation, the bank
unit making loans to the private sector, will lend 100 million
dollars to the joint venture pipeline and mobilize up to 300
million dollars in syndicated loans from commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Participating oil companies, banks and export credit agencies
would provide the remaining 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project has been estimated at 3.7 billion
dollars to develop the Doba fields and build the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
US firms ExxonMobil and Chevron are participating with 40 and
25 percent stakes respectively, as is Malaysia's Petronas, with 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank estimates that the project would generate 2 billion
dollars for Chad and 500 million dollars for Cameroon over a 25-
year period.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its pipeline investments, the bank also approved
two projects to help strengthen Chad's and Cameroon's capacities
for environmental management and monitoring of the petroleum
sectors.
</P>
<P>
These would be supported by 23.7 million dollars and 5.8
million dollars in credits from the International Development
Association, the bank's lending arm for the poorest countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday urged the
United Nations to immediately lift the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Shahrizat Abdul Jalil, deputy minister
in Malaysia's Prime Minister's Department at the general debate of
the United Nations General Assembly special session on women which
opened here Monday and will go through Friday.
</P>
<P>
"When we met in Beijing in 1995, most of us were still enjoying
rapid economic growth. Today, the situation has changed," Abdul
Jalil said.
</P>
<P>
"In Iraq for instance, the economic sanctions imposed by the
United Nations have brought adverse impact on the Iraqi population,
particularly women and children," Abdul Jalil said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Jalil said on humanitarian grounds, Malaysia urged
immediate lifting of the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted until it is
clarified that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction according to relevant resolutions of the United
Nations Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Urged to Build Potent Force for National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia should build a potent
defense force as a guarantee for its future security, the
country's Army Chief of Staff Tsadikan Gebretensae said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsadikan told local reporters that Ethiopia can only rely on
its own capability to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest offensive against Eritrea launched
between May 12 and 29, Tsadikan said Ethiopia has put out of
action most of the 24 Eritrean divisions and Eritrean leaders will
have to conduct extensive reconstruction of their army to make up
for the loss sustained.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the air power in the country, Tsadikan said
the Ethiopian air force has now reached a level where it can
effectively undertake any mission, no matter the magnitude of the
enemy's air defense system.
</P>
<P>
This has been demonstrated by the success of the missions it
has executed in recent times targeting Eritrea's military
facilities, including those in the capital Asmara, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report by spokesperson of Ethiopia,
fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean troops has been continuing
in the eastern Bure front, where the Ethiopian troops repulsed
attacks by the Eritrean army Tuesday afternoon, causing heavy
casualties to the latter's troops.

</P>
<P>
Addressing members of parliament, Cook said that the

Britain was exploring with its partners on the U.N. Security
Council a resolution banning trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone
except where they are certified as legitimate by the country's

market were legitimately exported.

<HEADLINE> Larsen Urges Lebanon, Israel to Respect U.N. Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special envoy
Terje Roed-Larsen here Tuesday afternoon urged both Lebanon and
Israel to respect Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Larsen told a press conference that before his returning to the
U.N. headquarters in New York Wednesday, he would continue talks
with Lebanese leaders. "Lebanon should respect U.N. decision and
implement it as a member state," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that "there have been remarkably few issues" between
the U.N. and Lebanese government, and for several times, he
expressed appreciation of Lebanese "full cooperation" with the
world organization.
</P>
<P>
Larsen also said the Shebaa Farms and demarcation of Israeli-
Lebanese border "are matters that were beyond" his mandate. The U.
N. had the responsibility to identify a line of withdrawal, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said once the U.N. cartographers end their field
work, he will hand his report to the secretary general, who will
submit it to Security Council. "The Council will judge whether
Israel implemented Resolution 425," he said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the principles for drawing the withdrawal line
were established in the secretary general's May 22 report to the
Security Council. The line was based on the best evidence that had
been available to the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Larsen confirmed that both Israel and Lebanon considered that
the withdrawal line drawn by the U.N. does not conform with their
respective definitions of the border, given the lack of mutually
agreed geographic co-ordinates and the imprecision of the written
descriptions of the 1923 agreement and the records of the Mixed
Armistice Commission.
</P>
<P>
As for the disputed Shebaa Farms, he suggested Syria and Lebanon
undertake a demarcation exercise to determine their border
precisely.
</P>
<P>
Shebaa Farms, the 200-square kilometer highly fertile land
located on the west side of Mount Hermon, which is under Israeli
occupation, were claimed by Lebanon as its, with Syrian support.
</P>
<P>
Israel argues the area belongs to Syria, and that a withdrawal
from it would be considered in peace talks with Damascus when they
resume.
</P>
<P>
Larsen disclosed that the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) will begin Wednesday to determine whether Israel's
withdrawal was in compliance with Resolution 425. Lebanese and
Israeli governments are also being provided with the maps of the
withdrawal line.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425, adopted by the Security Council after Israel's
first invasion of Lebanon more than two decades ago, calls for "
immediate and unconditional" withdrawal of Israeli troops from
Lebanese territory.

</P>
<P>
Under the draft plan, Arab leaders will meet in March every year
to discuss and coordinate stances on key political, economic and

<HEADLINE> Conditions for U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian Summit Still Immature: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Tuesday that the conditions for
holding a three-way summit between U.S., Israeli and Palestinian
leaders are still immature.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after meeting Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday afternoon, Albright noted that
all the sides should make efforts to help bring about such a summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clearing the way for a meeting by the end of June in the United
States between U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is reportedly the
major task of Albright's ongoing Middle East tour, which began on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It has been hoped that such a Camp David-style summit will
produce a final-status framework agreement between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Israel met in Camp David
in 1979 and hammered out a treaty, the first between an Arab
country and the Jewish state, to realize peace between the two
Middle East powers.
</P>
<P>
Barak had spelled out Israel's stands on the issue Monday night
after meeting with Albright, saying that the three-way summit is
important for pushing forward the peace process, but it could only
be held when Israel's security is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's news conference, Albright pointed out that she and
President Clinton had "rolled up sleeves" to help the two sides
reach a peace plan, but the final decision should be made by
Israeli and Palestinians leaders themselves.
</P>
<P>
During her talks with Arafat earlier Tuesday in the West Bank
city of Ramallah, Albright managed to persuade the Palestinian
leader to accept an arrangement, in which Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will be sent back to the Washington area early next
week and resume their works on a final settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat will also secure a meeting with Clinton at the
White House next Wednesday, a move aimed to advance the peace
process further after Clinton's meeting with Barak in Portugal last
week.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed her hope on Tuesday that the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations will make tangible progress on key final-
status issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements,
Palestinian refugees, border, security and water, with full-speed
after the resumption.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians launched their intensive peace talks
in March in the United States and moved the talks back to the
region in April. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank is considering to provide Egypt with
loans totaling 280 million U.S. dollars in the fiscal year 2000-
2001 starting July 1, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Ikram, director of the bank's Egypt department, told the
news agency that the bank is expected to approve the loans in mid-
June.
</P>
<P>
Of the loans, 80 million dollars will be earmarked for upgrading
Egypt's sanitary system, 100 million dollars for updating higher
education and the rest for industrial development, Ikram said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The volume of trade between the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Turkey increased by 67 percent to over 400
million U.S. dollars in 1999 compared with 1998, according to a
statement from the Turkish Embassy released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is the third highest among the countries having
trade with Turkey. Turkey's trade with India and Pakistan grew the
highest last year, the UAE official news agency quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish economic delegation will visit the UAE from June 9 to
13. The delegation will hold talks with high-level UAE officials
mainly on establishing a UAE-Turkey Business Council and eventually
concluding an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will comprise the prospective Turkish members of
the proposed UAE-Turkey Business Council.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank will provide Egypt with soft loans
totaling 175 million U.S. dollars under two agreements signed in
Cairo between the two sides on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will allocate the loans for upgrading rural development
and beefing up the private sector's role in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The agreements offered Egypt preferential terms, under which
half the loans are in grants.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and the United States signed here on Sunday a
cooperation agreement on updating and developing the control center
of the Aswan High Dam power station.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulated that the U.S. Agency of International
Development will grant Egypt 17 million U.S. dollars for the
project under the U.S.-Egypt program to develop Egypt's electricity
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Electricity Authority will also provide 10 million
Egyptian pounds (2.9 million dollars) for the renovation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt will upgrade the generators of the power
station. The German Reconstruction Bank has agreed to supply a soft
loan of 170 million German marks (104.79 million dollars) for the
project.

<HEADLINE> IGC Forecasts World Wheat Supply And Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The forecast for world wheat
production is 4 m. lower than last month at 587 m. tons, largely
reflecting reduced estimates for Hungary and Kazakhstan, it was
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the International Grains Council (IGC) said a crop of
this size would still be 4 m. tons more than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for wheat trade is unchanged at 102 m.tons, the
same as in 1999/00. Import requirements are projected to decline
in the CIS, Near East Asia and South Asia, while purchases into
South America, Pacific Asia and North Africa are expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast at a record 600 m.tons with
most of the increase in food use in developing countries,
according to the announcement by the IGC.
</P>
<P>
It said wheat stocks are forecast at 6 m. lower than last month
at 105 m. tons, due mainly to the reduction in estimated world
output.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Rises 2.4 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. non-farm labor productivity
increased at an annual growth rate of 2.4 percent in the first
quarter of the year, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The January-to-March gain in productivity, the amount of output
per hour of work, was the slowest quarterly performance since a 0.
5 percent increase in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of last year, productivity posted a
sharper 6.9 percent increase, the best showing in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, productivity has
increased at a solid 3.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. productivity growth has doubled in the past four years
compared to the previous two decades, a gain most economists
attributed to heavy investment by businesses in computers and
other productivity-enhancing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to
economic vitality and rising living standards. A sizable gain
means a company can pay employees more, hold the line on prices
and still deliver increased profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in productivity for all workers outside of farming
was accompanied by an acceleration in unit labor costs, which rose
at a rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter, the fastest
quarterly pace since a 4.2 percent growth rate in the second
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs dropped by 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Even with the pickup, unit labor costs, viewed over a longer
period, are still at low levels. Compared with the first quarter
of 1999, unit labor costs have risen by just 0.6 percent. For all
of 1999, they rose by 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Signs of slower growth have emerged in recent economic data,
including the latest unemployment report released last week which
showed the jobless rate climbed to 4.1 percent in May and
employers cut jobs. That prompted some economists to suggest that
the Fed may decide not to boost interest rates again later this
month.

<P>
ATHENS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation rose to 2.9
percent in May from April's 2.6 percent, the National Statistics
Service (NSS) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation stood at 2.4 percent and 5.3 percent
in May 1999 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rise of inflation is attributed mainly to the increases in
the fuel prices.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Social Advancement Depends On Women's Participation in Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- There cannot be social
advancement without public policies which favor the participation
of women in sustainable development with equality, Cuba said here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the United Nations General
Assembly special session on women, Ms Vilma Espin Guiliois, Member
of the Council of State of Cuba, said five years after the Beijing
Conference on women, important advances can be seen in some
regions and their countries in connection with the implementation
of some areas of the Platform for Action.
</P>
<P>
It was also true that in many places women claimed that this
major document for their progress had been well kept in long
forgotten archives, Guiliois said.
</P>
<P>
"Women's growing social protagonism and the pressures and
demands which have been put on governments by many women
organizations during the process of follow-up on Beijing, have
allowed to show some progress in the promulgation of laws which
acknowledge their political rights, incorporate the principle of
equality in family law," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Some governments have created mechanisms: ministries, offices,
committees which are exclusively mandated to bring about progress
for women," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, women had seen in these past five years how
they were excluded from opportunities to gain access to a
dignified job, an adequate professional and technical training,
health care and the guarantees of social security.
</P>
<P>
 Privatization, adjustment policies, financial crisis and the
International Monetary Fund formula had increased the feminization
of poverty and unemployment, the deprivation of work, and the use
of women as cheap labor force, she said,
</P>
<P>
"These are the most important issues that concern today women
from around the world, often aggravated by the indifference and
ineffectiveness of States weakened by the own neoliberal concept,
lack of political will, resources and development possibilities,"
she added.

LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Arsonists destroyed three Irish-

visitors to Northern Ireland capital of Belfast on early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The police were investigating an early morning fire in Belfast

The tourists from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were
in a hostel at the time of the attack and had intended to tour
Northern Ireland in the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British hard-liners hostile to the neighboring Irish
Republic were suspected of being behind the incident, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
No-one was hurt when the vehicles, parked outside a hostel in a
quiet city center side-street, were torched around 1:30 a.m.(00:30

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Secretary Face Pressure in Policing Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson was facing a difficult political balancing act
when he gave more details on the government's plans to reform
Northern Ireland's police force in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson was under pressure from nationalists and republicans
to ensure the Patten report on policing is implemented, while the
unionist community fears the former Hong Kong governor's proposals
go too far.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is pressing the government to honor its commitments
to implementing the report, while the Conservatives are calling
for the second reading of the Police Bill to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
There are also fears that if republican concerns are not met on
Patten report, then the Irish Republican Army could withdraw its
co-operation over the inspection of its arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein fears that under the Bill, commitments to addressing
the massive imbalance between Protestants and Catholics within the
police force may lapse after three years.
</P>
<P>
And the party is also worried that the reformed force may not
have a new name or badge and that current members of the RUC who
join it will not have to swear an oath committing them to uphold
human rights.
</P>
<P>
While the Tories are set to table an amendment calling for the
second reading of the Bill to be abandoned, Sinn Fein and the
nationalist Social and Democratic Labor Party (SDLP) have both
proposed more than 40 amendments to the Bill, warning that a lack
of alterations would have serious implications for the new
policing service.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes to Increase Funds for Iraq's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday recommended that the Security Council consider a
further addition of 300 million U.S. dollars to the allocation for
Iraq's oil spare parts and equipment for Phase VIII of the oil-for-
food program.
</P>
<P>
Annan's recommendation will bring the total allocation for
that phase to 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the Security Council, Annan welcomed
the decision by the Council to approve the allocation of an
additional 300 million dollars for the purchase of oil spare parts
and equipment for phases VI and VII of the program.
</P>
<P>
"This will assist in addressing the state of deterioration
that characterizes the oil industry in Iraq," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program, which began to be
implemented in late 1996, is an exception to the sanctions. The
program allows Iraq to generate a limited amount of funds through
the sale of oil, for the importation of food and basic medicines.
</P>
<P>
Today, Iraq is allowed to export unlimited amounts of oil and
to import a wide range of goods to meet the humanitarian needs of
its population and to rehabilitate its civilian infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the program, the authorized revenue ceiling
was 2 billion dollars in every six months, providing 1.32 billion
for the implementation of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the revenues earned by oil exports during
phase VII, which expires on Thursday, will reach 8.4 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Participate in Euro Zone, Says Government Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Economy and Finance Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou said Tuesday that Greece would participate in
the European Union's core for the first time because the country
had won the battle for growth and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Athens, just a day after an
EU finance ministers' decision to approve Greece's Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) membership, Papantoniou said that this was
the last step before a formal approval at an EU summit in Lisbon,
Portugal on June 19.
</P>
<P>
Greece missed the chance to enter into the euro zone last year
when it failed to satisfy the Maastricht criteria on inflation,
deficit and debt, but the country has now met all the five
necessary criteria following intensive convergence efforts.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that by the summer of 2001, the
majority of the 17 privatizations that were included in the agenda
of the Greek government would be completed.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Greek government successfully
materialized a program of 15 privatizations,he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Back Beef Labelling Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- European Union agriculture
ministers on Tuesday adopted a common position regarding the new
labelling formula for beef to be sold on consumer markets across
the union.
</P>
<P>
The new labelling formula is to be materialized in two stages
with the first one starting this Summer and the second one in
January 2002.
</P>
<P>
The slaughterhouses will have to be written on the labels of
beef products in the first stage while the farms where the cattle
is born and raised will have to be labelled as well to give
consumers more details on the traceability of the herd from which
the beef products come from.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already taken measures as regards the
time the cattle has to be raised to be suitable for producing beef
and de-boned beef products.
</P>
<P>
Computers are used to trace the origins of the cattle and ear
marks are also used to keep track of the animal from birth on to
the slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
Strict measures have to be resorted to after the madcow disease
hit most of the European Union member states, starting from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
A variant form of the madcow disease can also befall upon human
beings who then develop brain malfunctions. So far more than 20
patients have died of the madcow variant disease in Britain.
</P>
<P>
British beef had been banned from exporting to other EU
countries and the European Union has just lifted the ban, with
France still sticking to its ban against the British beef.
</P>
<P>
Cattle brains, eyes, blood and bones are still considered risk
materials to be consumed by human beings and to be used in the
production of animal feed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Proposes Setting up Trust Fund for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 6(Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday proposed to
set up a "Trust Fund For Women or a Globle Facility for Women" to
improve women's status and to promote the equality between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Suzanne Mubarak, head of the delegaton
of Egypt to the United Nations General Assembly special session on
women.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the special session, Suzanne
Mubarak said this facility would act as an umbrella to existing
institutions, programs and funds charged with the formulation of
strategies.
</P>
<P>
It would also consolidate presently fragmented efforts as well
as increase the resources needed to meet priority areas of
universal concern identified in the Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing in 1995, Suzanne Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Mubarak expressed the hope that the international
donor community together with the U.N. system should match their
partnership rhetoric with concrete actions for better coordination,
better-targeted support and a larger flow of aid resources.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Mubarak said this special session should agree on
action-oriented recommendations to be submitted to the Millennium
Summit in September so that the gender file could find its
rightful place in the U.N. agenda for the twenty-first century.
</P>
<P>
The special session, under the theme of "Women 2000: Gender
Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-first Century,"
opened here Monday and will go through Friday.
</P>
<P>
The special session will consider further actions and
initiatives for achieving gender equality in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the special session, Governments will issue a
political declaration calling for recommitment to the Beijing
Platform for Action.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Racism Law Passes EU Legialation Threshold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The first anti-racism law in the
European Union on Tuesday passed a major legislation threshold
when the social affairs ministers from EU member states endorsed
it.
</P>
<P>
The new law, when passed by the European Parliament, will put
all EU member states on a similar footing. Britain now already
has domestic anti-racism law whereas Sweden has little.
</P>
<P>
Though the Amsterdam Treaty gave the European Union the power
to adopt legislation to curb or counter discrimination, the
governments of member states will have to define what is meant by
discrimination, give victims means of redress, provide information
about the rights of individuals and monitor discriminative
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The agreement among EU social affairs ministers, said European
Social Affairs Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou in a statement,was
a clear sign of the commitment of the European Union to the
fundamental rights of the EU citizens.
</P>
<P>
One of the anti-racism law's controversial clauses will shift
the burden of proof in cases of discrimination onto companies and
providers of goods and services that are accused of racism.
</P>
<P>
They then have to prove that they did not discriminate.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's political agreement on the main aspects of the anti-
racism law was achieved just a year after the Amsterdam Treaty was
adopted by all EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Racism is still a social problem in EU member states. An EU
survey has found that more than one third of the respondents to
the questionnaire said that they feel themselves to be racially
discriminative.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Afflicted Area in Mozambique Faces Shortage of Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Shortage of seeds is one of the
major difficulties faced by farmers in the southern Mozambican
province of Gaza, where the floods hit hardest in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chokwe District director of Agriculture and Rural Development
Custodio Macome said on Tuesday that the 2,500 kits of seeds and
tools distributed by the government and non-governmental
organizations could only cover about 60 percent of the needs.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried because the planting season is passing us by
and this may have serious consequences for people, whose
livelihood depends on agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Chokwe, floods destroyed about 26,000 hectares of crops,
including rice, maize, beans and cassava early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Macome, the 700 or so commercial farmers in Chokwe
want the government to grant them loans at preferential interest
rates to restart their activity.
</P>
<P>
Some of these farmers will cultivate up to 10,000 hectares
each, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, administrator Albeto Langane of Chibuto district,
also in Gaza, said that his district is also running short of
seeds for the second season plantings.
</P>
<P>
In terms of livestock, Langane said that the district lost
about 4,000 heads of cattle to the floods -- a serious problem,
since most farmers use cattle for animal traction, and as a form
of wealth.
</P>
<P>
As for the resettlement of flood victims, Langane said that the
process is nearly completed and all the government-run
accommodation centers set up for the flood victims in the district
have now been dismantled.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Resources Contribute Greatly to S. African Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Coastal resources contribute
about 168 billion rand (about 24 billion U.S. dollars) annually to
the South African economy in the form of direct benefits, said
Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Joyce
Mabudafhasi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Cape Town on the launch of her department's White
Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development in South Africa,
Mabudafhasi said this figure represents about 35 percent of the
country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"Indirect benefits, for example, erosion control and waste
management treatment, are worth a further 134 billion rand (about
19 billion U.S. dollars) a year," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the value of coastal ecosystems as a cornerstone
for development was not sufficiently acknowledged in
decision-making in South Africa," she said, noting that many
coastal regions that were marginalized under apartheid offer great
potential for future development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, South African Environmental
Affairs and Tourism Minister Valli Moosa said the white paper
signals a fundamental shift in thinking about the coast.
</P>
<P>
"It ushers in a new era for coastal management rooted in the
understanding that our coast is a national asset and belongs to
all the people of South Africa," Moosa said.

LUSAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African Tourism (SATOUR)
says it has embarked on an ambitious marketing strategy aimed at
promoting the 14 member countries of Southern African Development
Community (SADC) in the international tourism market.
</P>
<P>
SATOUR manager for Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, Winston
Coercius, said currently, there were obstacles concerning regional
cooperation in the tourism sector which needed to be removed.
</P>
<P>
Coercius observed that obstacles in the region included visa
registration, which had become stringent to certain people.
</P>
<P>
He added that transporters such as buses, trains and planes
need to work hand in hand with organizations such as SATOUR in
order to provide information to would-be travellers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a one-day workshop for SATOUR here on Tuesday,
Coercius said there was an immediate need for him to create
information points in Lusaka and Ndola, Copperbelt Province, in
order to establish close cooperation with each other in order to
effect a smooth flow of information.
</P>
<P>
He added that his organization intended to bring major car hire
companies and best hotels like Sun International for a workshop in
October this year so as to enhance their relationships with local
tourism operators in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Continue to Violate Ceasefire: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) have been deliberately undermining the Lusaka
peace agreement and other initiatives meant to bring peace to the
DRC, according to a statement available here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Zimbabwe National Army spokesman Chancellor
Diye said this assessment was made by Ben Ncube, an official of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) allied forces
in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Ncube as saying that the SADC allied forces had
crushed an ill- fated attempt by the rebel Movement for the
Liberation of Congo (MLC) to cut the main supply routes to the
town of Mbandaka and the areas around the Ubangi River.
</P>
<P>
According to Ncube, MLC rebels led by Pierre Bemba had been
marching southward since the beginning of May, encroaching and
occupying some government-controlled areas along the Ubangi River
which separates the Republic of the Congo and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels have subsequently advanced southward from Imese, an
area they occupied at the time of signing the Kampala ceasefire
agreement in Uganda on April 14, 2000," Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
But the rebel advance along the Ubangi River was brought to a
halt on May 24 when allied forces dislodged and repulsed the
insurgents from Moboza, the official said, adding that heavily
armed rebels had ambushed a convoy of allied forces supply
vehicles en route to Moboza settlement.
</P>
<P>
Large quantities of arms recovered at Moboza indicated that the
rebels intended to advance southward and attack allied forces
position at Mbandaka, a town 800 kilometers northeast of Kinshasa
along the Congo River, Ncube said.
</P>
<P>
"The fall of Mbandaka would threaten Boende, Bokungu and Ikela
and thus giving an upper hand to the rebels," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ncube, there was relative calm elsewhere, although
there were some isolated incidents in the eastern part of the
country where other rebel groups had observed the peace
initiatives.

<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's former president Canaan
Banana began serving his sentence of one-year imprisonment for
sexual abuses last Friday, said Justice Legal and Parliamentary
Affairs Permanent Secretary Augustine Chikumira on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chikumira could not say from which prison the former head of
state was serving his sentence. "I can not say where he is
because the Prisons Department does not normally tell us which
prison a convict is sent to," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last week dismissed an appeal against both
conviction and sentence by Banana on 11 charges of sexual assault
and sodomy.
</P>
<P>
Banana was ordered to pay his former aide-de-camp Jefta Dube
250,000 Zimbabwean dollars (6,500 U.S. dollars) by August 31,
failure of which he would get a further two-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
When convicted in January 1999 by the High Court, Banana was
sentenced to a total of 10 years in jail for two counts of sodomy
and nine counts of other sexual offences.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Market Short of Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
Tuesday said the country's market will be still short of foreign
currency for the foreseeable future as exports remain depressed.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance reported a budget deficit of 21 billion
 Zimbabwean dollars (552 million U.S. dollars) in December 1999
which constituted 9.8 percent of gross domestic product and
exceeded a target of 7.5 percent, the bank said in its treasury
commentary.
</P>
<P>
The major cause of this large deficit has been attributed to
high inflation and interest rates and prospects of reducing the
budget deficit are out of reach unless the government cuts
expenditures dramatically, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Continued borrowing by the government has partly contributed
to a high money supply growth to the tune of 40.5 percent in
February this year compared to a target of 10 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the present situation, inflation is expected to remain
above 50 percent for a greater part of the year 2000," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, tobacco, the country's single largest
foreign currency earner, sold in the past 20 days of the selling
season was 9.57 million kilograms and lower than the same period
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the low sales, the prices of flue cured tobacco were
 significantly lower than what the farmers obtained last year, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said that despite a marginal appreciation in
common metal exchange, the gold price still remained suppressed as
volumes reduced.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold production country in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, trade is expected to be slow in the
coming months as demands wane off.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Arafat to Meet in Washington in Mid-June: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will meet
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on June 14 in the White
House, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the announcement at a press conference after two
hours of talks in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Ramallah, Albright also announced that
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will resume their final-status
talks early next week near Washington. She said Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has agreed to the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
She said that the two sides will have intensive discussions in a
bid to finalize a framework agreement, in preparation for a
permanent peace deal by September.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in the Middle East region from Moscow Monday in
an effort to bridge the gaps between Israel and the Palestinians to
thrash out the framework agreement on final-status issues including
Jerusalem, settlements, border, refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
She cautioned that both sides' demands will not be met fully,
but she said there is a golden opportunity to achieve better future
for the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, however, stressed again the need to implement the signed
agreements, especially sharm el Sheikh memorandum which is based on
the U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, in the same way Israel executed
resolution 425 to withdraw from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel complied with resolution 425 two decades after it was
adopted by pulling out all its troops from south Lebanon on early
May 24, ending its 22-year occupation there.
</P>
<P>
Albright has returned to Jerusalem where she started talks with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy. She will then meet Israeli
President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Albright in Jerusalem on Monday and is to meet her
again later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright will head to Cairo Wednesday to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Ban Mercy Killing, Cloning Human Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will impose a ban on mercy killings by doctors and other medical
personnel under any circumstances, reported UAE's official news
agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a draft federal law prepared by the Health Ministry, the
ban will apply even in cases in which patients suffer unbearable
pains and are under severe distress because of incurable diseases
and also when a patient himself wants it.
</P>
<P>
Any medical personnel committing "mercy killing" will be liable
to a 10-year-long imprisonment. But the switching off of artificial
respiratory equipment is not regarded by the draft as mercy
killing, in case three consultants agree that a patient is brain
dead.
</P>
<P>
It also bans cloning of human beings or carrying out any medical
research or experiments for the purpose of cloning humans.
Punishment for violation is 10 years imprisonment and a 20,000-
dirham (about 5,450 U.S. dollars) fine.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, its rulings and penalties will be
applied on medical staff in government and private institutions, as
well as specialists in herbal medicine, genetic engineering,
radiotherapy, laboratory tests, nutrition, medicines and medical
equipment, medical research and midwifery.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Oil Pollution Threatens Mangroves in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Oil pollution in the Gulf is
threatening the growth of mangroves in the UAE waters, an ideal
habitat for a variety of fish, shrimps and other marine animals,
the UAE official news agency quoted a research study as saying
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The research, conducted by the Fisheries Department in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, showed that mangrove
seedlings will not germinate in even slightly oil-polluted soil.
Oil-soaked propagule (seeds) will not grow in unpolluted water
either.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has
about 3,000 hectares of mangroves. A threat to the mangrove is a
threat to the sea animals living under its shade.
</P>
<P>
The mangrove is very luxuriant near the Umm Al Qaiwain Emirate
which is a very productive fishing ground, according to the
research.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf is always prone to oil pollution. The amount of oil
leaked into the Gulf waters during the 1991 Gulf War, as estimated
in November 1991, was between six and eight million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Among the other reasons for oil spillage are tanker collisions,
tanker wash-outs and a host of other illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
In view of its role in the development of fishery resources, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries attached special attention on
the protection of the mangrove-grown areas and the cultivation of
mangroves.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Refutes Muslim Leader's Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government refuted
Tuesday a top Muslim leader's accusation that the government
failed to fulfill the provisions of the peace agreement it signed
with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora told reporters that 23.7
billion pesos (593 million U.S. dollars) worth of projects aimed
at transforming Mindanao into a food basket had been unveiled
during President Joseph Estrada's visit to the island three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
This is apart from the annual increased budgetary outlay for
the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) from 3.07 billion
pesos (76.75 million dollars) during the period 1991-1995 to
almost 15 billion pesos (375 million dollars) during the period
1995-1999.
</P>
<P>
Aside from these socio-economic development projects, over 5,
000 MNLF members have already been integrated into the Armed
Forces of the Philippines, consisting of 160 officers and 4,960
enlisted personnel, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Another 1,000 MNLF cadres are now members of the Philippine
National Police, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora made the remarks in response to the charges raised by
ARMM Governor Nur Misuari before the 27th Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) Foreign Ministers meeting held recently.
</P>
<P>
In that meeting, Misuari reportedly accused the government of
not fulfilling the provisions of the 1996 peace agreement with the
MNLF, citing the 26 years of a "supposedly fruitless search for
autonomy" to justify the need for the MNLF to revive its bid for "
self determination and independence."

</P>

Noting that India was among the 10 fastest-growing economies

8 to 10 percent economic growth in the medium term, though "
ambitious," could be "feasible" if the country further accelerates
economic reforms, the PTI reported.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Meeting Calls for "Fair Basis" in Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries and economies
in the Asia-Pacific region should be integrated into the world
trading system on a "fair and equitable basis", participants of a
United Nations' regional forum said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's Ministerial Meeting of the 56th Commission
session of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) here, the delegates from 61 ESCAP members
discussed a wide range of issues related to globalization, and
agreed that the developing countries must be treated fairly in the
process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
While the developing countries must be allowed to develop at
their own pace, they said, strategic steps must be undertaken to
ensure that they can increase their knowledge level in order not
to be left behind in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Warning that "the developing countries would be further
marginalized if the widening gap between rich and poor nations
left unsolved," they call for the rich, developed countries to
take the lead in narrowing the divide.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries, they pointed out, that they should do
their best to adapt to the new environment of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Membership and effective participation in international trade
negotiations and organizations such as the World Trade
Organization can also be a good option for developing countries to
benefit from the globalization process and shielding themselves
against its negative impacts, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted, the trade negotiations among developing
and developed countries should be based on the principle of
fairness and equity.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Beaten by Sanchez-Vicario at French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams was eliminated in the
quarter-finals at the French Open on Tuesday, losing a baseline
duel against three-time champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 6-0, 1-6,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Williams stuck to her groundstrokes against the steadier and
more experienced clay-court expert Sanchez-Vicario.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Williams was playing in only her third
tournament after being sidelined for six months with tendinitis in
both wrists.
</P>
<P>
Williams started hard, committing 20 errors in the first five
games and lost them all.
</P>
<P>
Even improvement in the second set could not save her, who
looked increasingly tired as she lost a succession of long points
from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
The tournament was her last chance to win a Grand Slam title as
a teen-ager. She turns 20 on June 17, nine days before Wimbledon
begins.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario, seeded eighth, won the French Open as a 17-
year-old in 1989, and again in 1994 and 1998. The 28-year-old
will meet fifth-seeded Conchita Martinez or 17-year-old qualifier
Marta Marrero in an all-Spaniard semifinal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In men's play, unseeded Franco Squillari became the first
Argentine to reach the French Open quarter-finals since 1991,
beating Younes El Aynaoui 6-4, 6-1, 6-3 in a rain-interrupted
match.
</P>
<P>
Squillari, 23, will next play unseeded Albert Costa, who became
the third Spaniard to reach the men's quarter-finals when he won
over No. 9 Lleyton Hewitt, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The last Argentine to make in the quarter-finals at Roland
Garros was Franco Davin nine years ago, and the last to win the
tournament was Guillermo Vilas in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Squillari has never previously been beyond the second round in
a Grand Slam tournament.

<HEADLINE> High School Graduates Eye Key Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- As the July 7 national college
entrance exam is approaching, information about the exam has
become a hot topic among students in China.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 students and their parents in Shanghai poured to
entrance exam consulting centers last weekend.
</P>
<P>
China's higher education institutions will continue to increase
college enrollments to three million.
</P>
<P>
For majority of high school graduates and their parents in
China today, it is no longer a dream any more to pursue higher
education. What concerns students most, is which university to go
to and what specialty to choose.
</P>
<P>
A teacher from Fudan Middle School in Shanghai said that most
of his students prefer a prestigious university rather than
selecting a specialty of their choice.
</P>
<P>
"Key universities have many advantages because their graduates
generally find jobs more easily, compared with graduates from
other universities," said the teacher.
</P>
<P>
However, parents emphasized that they want their children to "
get enough opportunities to foster their natural abilities".
</P>
<P>
Universities that have merged with other universities and
colleges have attracted many inquirers. After merging with Beijing
University, Beijing Medical University -- now the Medical College
of Beijing University -- has attracted a large number of students.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities enrolled 2.7 million freshmen last year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Delegation in Riyadh to Coordinate Positions on Maritime Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Kuwaiti
delegation arrived in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Tuesday to
coordinate their
positions on a long-standing maritime border dispute among Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, led by Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh al-Sabah and
Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali al-N'aimi
respectively, will try to reach an agreement on the demarcation of
the borders on the Al-Dorra continental shelf in northern Gulf,
said reports reaching here from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf states have been negotiating for years to try to
work out a demarcation scheme for the gas-rich continental shelf.
But no solution has been found so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Iran started drilling for gas in the disputed
area, triggering concern and protests from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
But Iran announced on May 13 the "halt of the operations".
</P>
<P>
Tehran has also reportedly expressed its readiness to open talks
with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to reach an understanding on this
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
As the Kuwaiti-Saudi meeting comes ahead of the proposed
Kuwaiti-Saudi-Iranian meeting, likely to be held later in June, the
two Arab neighbors are expected to coordinate their positions on
the thorny border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis and Kuwaitis are also likely to discuss the date and
venue for the tripartite meeting, said Kuwaiti newspapers on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan air force Tuesday
were investigating an incident a day earlier when an Israeli-built
naval Dvora gunboat was bombed and destroyed accidentally by an
air force jet in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were trying to find out how the pilot
mistook the gunboat for a craft of Sea Tigers, the naval unit of
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
They said 22 naval personnel were dead or unaccounted for in
Monday's clash after two Dvora patrol craft were hit in a mid-sea
battle off the Vetrilaikerni coast of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
One craft was rammed by Sea Tiger rebels but the second was
destroyed by the Sri Lankan air force which had been called in to
target rebel vessels in the area.
</P>
<P>
The military said they had destroyed at least four vessels of
Sea Tigers.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels said in a statement on Monday evening that they
lost 12 fighters in the fierce sea battle which lasted for several
hours.
</P>
<P>
The rebels claimed that they managed to damage at least two
other Dvora patrol craft.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan armed forces have been buying Israeli-built
modern weapons systems to boost their battle against LTTE rebels,
who have been fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government officials are preparing for a nationwide
celebration on Wednesday to boost the morale of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies will be led by President Kumaratunga from her
official residence in Colombo. She is also expected to make a
statement to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been battling to wrest control of the
Jaffna peninsula from the government troops since overrunning a
strategic base in April.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has directed several government agencies to ensure the full and
effective implementation of existing and applicable fishing laws
and regulations to protect Sulu Sea and its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said Tuesday in a statement that
President Estrada also directed the agencies on Monday to
accelerate the development of the fishing industry in the area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Abu Sayyaf, the extremist group holding 21 mostly
foreign hostages, called on the government to implement laws that
would prevent foreign fishing vessels from poaching in the Sulu
Sea and nearby waters.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the Sulu Sea was one of the three conditions set by
the Abu Sayyaf for the release of the hostages who were taken from
the resort island of Sipadan island in Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
The other two conditions, setting up an independent Muslim
state in Mindanao and the creation of a commission to protect
Filipino Muslims in Sabah, Malaysia, have been rejected by the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, the president's order was
intended to bring lasting peace and development in Mindanao, which
he wants to transform into the country's food basket.

<HEADLINE> 900 Million People Below Poverty Line in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice
President Myoung-Ho Shin Tuesday said that an estimated total of
900 million people remain below the income poverty line in Asia,
noting the number accounts for two thirds of the poor population
in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"A more resolute effort needs to be given to poverty reduction
so that fewer people would be vulnerable to future crises," Shin
said in his speech to the 2nd Asia Development Forum which opened
Tuesday morning with the participation of some 400 people from
across East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Shin drew attention to the social damage and the full human
costs wrought by the Asian economic crisis, emphasizing that the
poor continue to reel from the crisis, suffer the most and be the
slowest to recover.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has highlighted Asia's persisting social challenge
made increasingly daunting by the number of poor people in the
region," the ADB official said, billing the renewed emphasis on
the problem of poverty as "one positive thing that has come out of
the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis has also underscored the need for policy
reforms in social sectors, in addition to those in the banking and
corporate sectors," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same gathering, Singapore Minister for Finance Richard
Hu also stressed the need to address the development gaps and
income disparities brought about by globalization and "New Economy.
"
</P>
<P>
"Globalization had brought about unprecedented prosperity but
also exacerbated income disparities within countries," he said,
noting that "the distribution of wealth and opportunities cannot
depend solely on the free market."
</P>
<P>
He said that Asian governments, the business community and
civil society need to work together to ensure that the less
prepared members of the population are given the necessary skills
to participate in the new knowledge economy.

OTTAWA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American States
(OAS) adopted a plan Monday night to send back a delegation to
Peru, from which the OAS withdrew its monitors last month over
alleged election "irregularities."
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies Granda
accepted the resolution, but denied any "electoral fraud."
</P>
<P>
He told the OAS general assembly that terrorists and inflation
were among major threats being faced by the South American country.
</P>
<P>
"That is why as Peruvian, we would like to be judged for what
we have already accomplished, not for what we have left to do to
reach a utopian ideal of democracy that can never be reached," he
said in a statement to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The OAS plan was adopted after debate in which some member
states expressed the fear that the organization is breaking with
the principle of non-intervention toward paternalism that revives
only memories of the Montroe Doctrine, a policy of U.S. domination
of the hemisphere.

<HEADLINE> China's Westward Focus to Challenge Surveying and Mapping Depts. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The central government's decision
to develop west China has created both opportunities and
challenges for the country's surveying and mapping departments,
said the director of the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping.
</P>
<P>
Surveying and mapping work done to date for west China's vast
area leaves much to be desired, SBSM Director Chen Bangzhu said.
Most maps of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region were made in the
1960s and 1970s, when the area lagged far behind the rest of the
country in development.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, his
bureau will provide general surveying and mapping reference data
for the central government, including information on
infrastructure construction, environmental protection, and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that western China's development is a
systematic and long-term task, which will make room for
innovations in the surveying and mapping work.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will cooperate with departments of water conservancy,
communications, civil affairs, and environment protection in
developing west China, said Chen, adding that his staff also will
supervise programs on the environment, global positioning system (
GPS) projects, and remote sensing.

<HEADLINE> China Hails Its Contributions to Int'l Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's top environmental official
said here today China has made its due contributions to the
protection of the global environment as the largest developing
country in the world and a huge region facing numerous
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum on the thoughts of late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping on foreign affairs, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
Environmental Protection Administration, listed a number of
efforts China has made in international environmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China sponsored the ministerial meeting on the environment and
development in 1991, at which the Beijing Declaration was
published, the director said, adding the document had a great
impact on the United Nations Development and Environment
Conference in 1992, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Li Peng, then premier of China, participated in the UN
conference, where he put forward five-point proposals on the
environment and development and took the lead in signing two
conventions on climate changes and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The director said China has signed a number of environment-
related conventions and participated in projects in cooperation
with other countries or international groups.
</P>
<P>
China also signed bilateral agreements or memos of
understanding on environmental cooperation with over 30 countries,
and 15 agreements on cooperation in maintaining nuclear safety and
radiation-free environments, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the international negotiations at global environmental
meetings, China has always abided by the principle that the
developed and developing countries have both common and different
responsibilities for global environmental problems, and opposed
hegemonies in environmental fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the excessive requirements developed countries
have asked developing countries to meet, China has made it clear
time and again that rich countries are obliged to take initiatives
in global environmental protection, and help developing countries
in protecting the global environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
China holds the view that from both historical and realistic
perspectives, developed countries are chiefly responsible for
today's environmental problems, while developing countries are the
victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Guangya told those gathered
at today's discussion that rich countries have so far failed to
honor the commitments they made at the 1992 United Nations
Environment and Development Conference, including offering
financial support for developing countries to protect the
environment and provide environmental technology at preferential
prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A book titled Science Against
Superstition has been published by a local publishing house to
promote belief in fact over fiction.
</P>
<P>
The book was jointly compiled by the Organization Department of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the
Department of Publicity of the CPC Central Committee and the China
Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
It contains Marxism's fundamental ideas on science and the CPC'
s practice on science-oriented belief.
</P>
<P>
The book analyzes why superstitions such as the officially-
banned cult Falun Gong have become so widespread. It also
clarifies definitions of religion and superstition.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Italian Scientists Find Possible Trace of Dark Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A research group composed of both
Chinese and Italian scientists have found what they believe to be
traces of dark matter, announced the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) today.
</P>
<P>
Four scientists from the Institute of High Energy Physics under
the CAS and some experts from the University of Rome drew the
conclusion from their observations in a DAMA (Dark Matter)
laboratory, 1,000 meters underground in Gran Sasso, Italy.
</P>
<P>
In recent experiments, they used a large piece of crystal to
catch the reflection of movement of dark matter particles, and
succeeded in finding a trace which might prove the existence of
dark matter.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that more than 90 percent of matter in space
is dark matter, but proving this is a major challenge because dark
matter does not emit or absorb light.
</P>
<P>
The result from the DAMA lab has attracted attention of
scientists the world over. Physicists at Stanford University in
the U.S. attempted the same experiment but failed to find similar
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the international high-energy physics circle said
that more data should be obtained from further experiments before
any concrete conclusion can be drawn about the existence of dark
matter.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to cooperate with Italian scientists in this
field, the institute of High Energy Physics is also going to build
observation equipment in China to carry out its own experiments in
the search for dark matter.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government to Sell Holdings of Largest Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government plans to
sell its remaining 17.3 percent of Bank Hapoalim, the largest bank
in the country, on Tuesday in a public offering on the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange, which is expected to raise as much as 2.6 billion
shekels (650 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government will sell 14.6 percent of the bank to the public
and institutional investors and 2.7 percent to the bank's
employees. The sale will be the largest public offering ever on the
local bourse.
</P>
<P>
The previous largest government offering took place in December
1998, when the government raised over 1.2 billion shekels (300
million dollars) from the sale of its 18.75-percent stake in
Israeli Chemicals on the TASE.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government collected bids for shares and warrants
from institutional investors in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The road show was so successful that an extra day was necessary
to meet with interested investors", the Israeli daily The Jerusalem
Post quoted Shimon Gal, managing director of MI Holdings, as
saying. MI Holdings is a company in charge of selling state-
owned bank shares.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a 50/50 split between shares and warrants, the
offering will be considered successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government may prefer to sell all its holdings as shares,
but realizes it may get left with some warrants.
</P>
<P>
Gal is confident that investors with warrants will choose to
convert them to shares in 18 months due to the bank's dividend
policy, which assumes that the bank will continue to show high
profitability.
</P>
<P>
Bank Hapoalim posted favorable results in the first quarter of
2000, with an increase of 26.6 percent in net profit to 428 million
shekels (107 million dollars) and 16.9 percent net return on
equity.
</P>
<P>
The government still owns 43 percent of Bank Leumi and 53
percent of Israel Discount Bank, the other two largest banks in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Gal does not consider the privatization of the Discount and
Leumi as linked. Yet some analysts believe the government is
hesitant to sell off the relatively more attractive Leumi, fearing
it will limit the investors' interest in the less appealing
Discount.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are two consortia bidding for control of
Discount. The privatization of Discount is behind schedule,
according to a timetable originally set two years ago and Gal
believes a decision will be reached within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The managing director also hopes to unveil privatization plans
for Leumi, the country's No. 2 bank, within two or three months. He
believes it must be a government priority to privatize banks,
particularly in the light of the increasing competition from
foreign banks entering the Israeli market.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Syria to Meet on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (xinhua) -- Turkey and Syria are scheduled to
hold their sixth meeting on security and cooperation in Istanbul on
Tuesday, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military said in a statement issued over the weekend
that the meeting will take place at Harbiye Military Museum and
Culture Center in the country's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Five previous meetings, two in Turkey and three in Syria, have
been held since the two countries signed an agreement in Adana,
south Turkey, on October 20, 1998, which determined a common
understanding on security and cooperation against the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria, which were at odds over security and water-
sharing issues for more than a decade, have recently taken steps to
improve their economic, social and military ties.
</P>
<P>
In another move indicating mutual desire for better ties, apart
from political contacts, the Turkish army football team is to have
a match with its Syrian army counterpart in Istanbul Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Turkish General Staff,
the match, billed as football diplomacy, will be the first in the
two armies' history.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Transport Minister Changes Mind on Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Transport Minister
Ling Liong Sik, who surprised the nation on May 22 by announcing
he will quit the Cabinet, Tuesday decided to stay on.
</P>
<P>
Ling, who is the president of Malaysian Chinese Association (
MCA), the largest Chinese-based party in Malaysia, made the
announcement of his change of mind in a prepared statement read
out to reporters at the MCA headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Ling, who returned Monday night from a 10-day holiday in Perth
to think over his quit decision, said that he met Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday afternoon and has once again been advised
to stay on in his post.
</P>
<P>
The news conference called by Ling to announce his decision not
to quit, however, did not materialize as he declined to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
MCA leaders, including Deputy President Lim Ah Lek, all four
vice presidents who were present, greeted Ling's announcement with
much cheer.
</P>
<P>
Ling said in the statement, "I am touched by the support and
encouragement of all parties calling on me to reconsider the
resignation from the cabinet post."
</P>
<P>
"I respect the wishes expressed by all parties especially MCA
members, community leaders, my supporters and friends. As such, I
would like to announce that I will continue to serve in the
government," Ling said.
</P>
<P>
After he made the sudden and unexpected announcement of his
intention to resign from his cabinet post last month, Mahathir
advised him to just keep his resignation letter and wanted him to
go on leave to think over his decision.
</P>
<P>
Ling's expressed intention to resign from his cabinet post had
created reactions among MCA leaders and party members at all
levels, leaders of Chinese organizations, Barisan Nasional (
National Front, of which MCA is a component) leaders and the
public.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Aims to Becoming "eGovernment" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan unveiled the eGovernment Action
Plan at the opening ceremony of CommunicAsia2000, Asia's largest
communications event, which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (870
million U.S.dollars) will be set aside to implement the
eGovernment vision over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The eGovernment vision is defined by Tan as one which members
of the public and businesses can reach and through which the
government wants to better serve the nation in the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
Besides the generous financing, the government has mapped out
five strategic thrusts to achieve the broad blueprint and its
desired outcomes.
</P>
<P>
These include pushing the envelope of electronic service
delivery, building new capability and new capacity, innovating
with infocomm technologies, anticipating to be proactive, sensing
to be responsive and developing thought leadership on eGovernment.
</P>
<P>
Six programs, that is, a knowledge-based workplace, electronic
service delivery, technology experimentation, adaptive and robust
infocomm infrastructure and infocomm education, have been
identified to support the five strategic thrusts.
</P>
<P>
"Governments the world over have a major role to play in
realizing the socio-economic potential and benefits of the
Internet economy for their industries and citizenry," Tan said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is prepared to challenge tried and
tested ways of doing things, even if these have been highly
successful in the past and are adequate for the present.
</P>
<P>
"The new economy demands that we adopt a 'creative destruction'
approach in our policies, regulations and work processes to keep
up with the rapid developments in the global economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government took on a massive computerization
program in the 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all government

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Urged to Grab Chances for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Speakers at the ongoing Second
Asia Development Forum have urged Asian countries to seize the
current favorable opportunities to achieve economic growth and
bring about a new era of prosperity now that they have the
consensus that all Asian economies have emerged rather well from
the depth of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This current state of relative economic stability is a window
of opportunity for Asian countries to prepare themselves to get
back on track for the next spurt of economic growth," Singapore
Minister for Finance Richard Hu told the gathering which opened
Tuesday morning with the participation of some 400 people from
across East Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
The participants include officials from the World Bank and
members of the development community in East Asia including
leading policymakers, economists, development specialists,
academics, businesspeople and representatives of civil society.
</P>
<P>
"The worst may be over but it is no time for Asia to be
complacent. Reforms are far from complete," Richard Hu stressed
</P>
<P>
"The region will face increased competition for foreign
investments from other emerging markets like Latin America and
East Europe," he said, adding "the challenges of globalization and
the realities of the 'new economy' must be faced."
</P>
<P>
He urged Asian countries to better position themselves, to
create and seize the opportunities that will bring about a new era
of prosperity by writing out a prescription for sustainable
economic growth out of six lessons drawn from the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening of the forum, Vice President of
the Asian Development Bank Myoung-Ho Shin said recent
macroeconomic data on the crisis economies indicate that the
recovery has remarkably been more robust than anticipated and
Asian countries now have a better grasp of the policy measures
that need to be pursued in order to sustain the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis has underscored the need for policy reforms in
the social sectors in addition to those in the banking and
corporate sectors," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the World Bank Institute Vinod Thomas also
stressed that need for East Asia to convert today's recovery into
a period of sustained, broadly shared growth and to make success
in transforming its business, public, and social institutions.
</P>
<P>
East Asia region provides an excellent laboratory for testing
the promise of a knowledge-led development strategy and they are
poised to share knowledge and seize emerging opportunities, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The forum, second of its kind, will last to Thursday. The first
one was held in the Philippines in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipino Workers Remittances Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)
remain one of the highest-dollar earners for the Philippines as
remittances from OFWs hit a record high of 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, the Department of Labor and Employment said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Labor Secretary Felicisimo Joson said that in last year
alone 837,020 highly-skilled OFWs were deployed to more than 160
countries in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Norh and South America,
Africa and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
Joson said in a statement that on top of the total number of
workers deployed last year, nearly 80,000 more land-based OFWs
were also deployed worldwide in the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
This development shows that the country remains one of the top
labor exporters at the onset of the new millennium, Joson said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is honoring the more than 7 millions
of overseas Filipino workers and their families during the
observance of Migrant Workers' Day on June 7.
</P>
<P>
Activities to be undertaken include skills fair, livelihood
training, free medical services, and free overseas calls for OFW
relatives, Overseas Employment Administration Chief Reynaldo
Regalado said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Manny Villar pointed out that the House of
Representatives recognizes the contributions of the OFWs to the
nation's economy as it is committed to passing legislation to
benefit the country's "modern day heroes."
</P>
<P>
Villar said that several measures that aim to propagate the
interest of the OFWs are being taken up in the House.
</P>
<P>
These include a bill that will give the right of absentee
voting to OFWs, a bill to create a pension fund for OFWs, a bill
to establish a special hospital to serve the needs of OFWs and
their families, and a measure creating an OFW bank, among others.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuously looking at ways to assist our overseas
workers and will provide the needed legislative support to respond
to their concerns," said Villar.

necessities were blocked by the flood-ravaged roads, railway and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
The international community provided 50 million U.S. dollars
worth of relief aid to 2 million people affected by the flood, and
pledged 450 million dollars to support the country's
reconstruction in a donors conference in Rome last month.
</P>
<P>
Diogo attributed the fast drop of inflation rate to the
hospitable assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has offered to
host the second Earth Summit which is set to take place in 2002,
Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Valli Moosa announced
in Cape Town on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African cabinet had decided to support a bid
to host the event and whether this is successful or not will be
known "in a month or two".
</P>
<P>
The first Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in
1992, where more than 100 heads of state gathered to address
urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The assembled leaders also signed conventions on climate change
and biological diversity and adopted Agenda 21, a 300-page plan
for achieving sustainable development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said many countries around the world believe South Africa
will be a suitable venue for the second Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the event, which is believed to be attended by
scores of heads of state and tens of thousands of delegates, will
have a large and lasting impact on environmental issues in the
Southern African region.

<HEADLINE> EU Hails Ukrainian Decision to Close Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday hailed
the Ukrainian decision to close down the nuclear power plant at
Chernobyl, 14 years after the world's worst nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
Gunnar Wiegand, a European Commission spokesman, described the
decision as "historic." He said the decision came 14 years after
the melt-down disaster and five years after the G-7 summit that
resulted in a memorandum concerning the closure of the nuclear
power plant.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine announced Monday that it is closing the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant on December 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission was delighted by the Ukrainian decision
and the timing was in line with Ukraine's long-standing commitment
with the G-7 and the European Union, said Commission President
Romano Prodi and External Commissioner Christopher Patten in a
joint written statement released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation EU, has
provided Ukraine with 100 million euro (94 million U.S. dollars)
as the Chernobyl shelter fund.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is among the
conditions for the release of 92 million euro (86 million dollars)
macro-economic assistance from the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Prodi-Patten statement said that the Ukrainian decision
opened the way for rapid progress in the financial aid area,
including a substantial Euratom loan from the commission as part
of a global package involving the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and other donors.
</P>
<P>
Gunnar said the Euratom loan was in the amount of 1.5 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Condemns Solomon Islands' Rebels for Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday
condemned the coup in the Solomon Islands during which Prime
Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu has been taken hostage by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
A European Commission spokesman said that the commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation bloc, said the commission "will
follow the situation on the islands closely."
</P>
<P>
The EC will consider a cut in the European aid to the island
country after the result caused by the coup becomes clear-cut, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman added the EC would not cut off the aid
right away in a fear that the move could hurt the elected
government.
</P>
<P>
The EU has invested a total of 65 million euro (about 61
million U.S. dollars) in the island country, with 19 million euro
as financial aid.
</P>
<P>
A government official in the Solomon Islands said Tuesday that
Ulufa'alu had offered to resign following rising tension in the
country, so as to avert a civil war.
</P>
<P>
Gunfire was traded Tuesday near the airport between the ethnic
Malaita rebels and the Guadalcanal natives.

"Our only gold chance lies in the women's 20 kilometers walk
event," Shang said. "But we are likely to win one or two medals
of other colors from women's middle and long distance running,
women's shot put and long jump."
</P>
<P>
Shang said that China will send about 30 track and field
athletes to Sydney though some 60 Chinese athletes have qualified
for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We will only send to the Games those who could make the top
eight at Sydney," he said.

Shang said that even legendary coach Ma Junren could hardly
create Olympic miracles, adding the CAA expects only one medal
from Ma's runners.

"Ma's students are very young and they lack experience in major
international competition. We told him that his task was to win a

Ma will field more than 10 women runners in the two-day

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Tourism Festival Attracts Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The scenic Three Gorges in
southwest China's Chongqing Municipality is expected to see a
surge in tourists with the opening of the Three Gorges Tourism
Festival today.
</P>
<P>
It's the fifth year for the annual tourism festival, but
sponsors said this year's event may attract more attention because
of the central government-initiated strategy of developing the
west.
</P>
<P>
Extending more than 500 kilometers, the Three Gorges is well-
known for its beautiful scenery and abundant cultural relics on
both banks of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The site became the hottest tourist destination in 1997 after
the Chinese government announced its plan to build the biggest
hydropower station on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The tourism festival of 2000 is a major component of the
municipality's ambitious program to develop the west, which is
expected to create a bridge between overseas tourists and
investors and the vast western areas in China, said Bao Xuding,
mayor of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 guests have been invited to the 15-day tourism
festival, during which an international symposium will also be
held to attract more overseas investment to facilitate the western
expansion program.

<HEADLINE> Relocation Project Won't Force Residents out of Native Place: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
announced that about 90 percent of the residents to be relocated
from the reservoir area of the Three Gorges project need not go
far from their hometowns or travel a great distance to get to work.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents will be able to live close to their
former home, said Wang Hongju, vice mayor of Chongqing
Municipality, which is responsible for resettling 85 percent of
the residents to be resettled from the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
"Most old village names have been also used for the new
villages, and the only difference is that the villagers are living
in better-quality houses enjoying a better living environment,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
By launching the Three Gorges Project, China aims to build the
world's largest hydropower station. The project, planned to be
completed in 2009, calls for a total of 1.07 residents to be
relocated from the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Wang said about 100,000 of the relocated residents will leave
their homes in Chongqing for Sichuan Province in southwest China
and Shanghai, and these residents will be able to enjoy a much-
improved living standard there.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, only 140,000 residents will
be relocated to faraway places from their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
The relocation project has entered its second stage, with 230,
000 residents already moved to Chongqing alone.

BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Many opthamologists from Tongren
Hospital in Beijing, which is renowned for its advanced eye care
treatment, took to the street to give people basic information on
caring for their eyes to mark today's National Healthy Eye Day.
</P>
<P>
The year's Eye Day focused on the restoration of eyesight for
cataract patients. Some eye doctors at the hospital gave several
impoverished cataract patients living on the outskirts of Beijing
free cataract operations.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are the leading eye problem in both developed and
developing countries. Some half of the 10 million eye disease
patients in China are cataract sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Surgery is considered to be the only effective way for cataract
patients to regain eyesight. Over 10,000 cataract operations are
done in Beijing every year.
</P>
<P>
Among those who have received the operation in Tongren Hospital,
the eldest is 106 years old and the youngest, two months old.

<HEADLINE> Shas Threatens to Topple Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition partner Shas party threatened Tuesday to topple
the government by voting in favor of a bill which asks for early
elections.
</P>
<P>
Shas Knesset (parliament) member Yair Perez said Tuesday that he
has been asked to mobilize the party's legislators to vote in favor
of the bill, which is expected to come up in the Knesset for a
preliminary reading on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, prepared by opposition legislator Avigdor Lieberman,
is in pursuit of dissolving the Knesset and holding early
elections.
</P>
<P>
Up to now it is not certain whether Lieberman will ask the
Knesset to vote on his bill, and local political analysts said
Lieberman will pull his legislation if it is not guaranteed a
majority of 61 votes of the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Barak and the Shas leadership took a rapid turn
for the worse on Monday. Responding to a Shas threat to vote in
favor of the bill if Shas' demand for fund allocations to its
educational system is not met, Barak ordered officials from the
Finance and Education Ministries to suspend their talks with Shas
over the funding.
</P>
<P>
Barak declared that he is not going to conduct negotiations that
are accompanied by Shas' threats, even if the threats are implicit.
</P>
<P>
Shas' education system is in deep debt due to its poor
management over the past few years. Education Minister Yossi Sarid
refused to allocate more funds to that system until it improves its
management and fires corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Shas wants Barak to order Sarid to transfer millions of shekels
to its cash-strapped school system. And this dispute has been
dragging on for months without proper settlement.
</P>
<P>
Shas has 17 Knesset members. If it supports the new election
bill, Barak's coalition, already whittled down by defectors such as
the National Religious Party which disagrees with Barak's peace
policies, may have trouble for survival this time.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands PM Offers to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Solomon Islands' Prime Minister
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu Tuesday offered to resign as part of a deal
to end the country's crisis, the Australian Associated Press (AAP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The AAP quoted Solomon Islands' Minister of State Alfred Sasako
as saying after an emergency cabinet meeting that Ulufa'alu "has
given an undertaking that if that was the price for the return of
peace in the Solomons, then, yes, he is willing to stand aside."
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu was escorted to the meeting at gunpoint by members of
the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) which seized power in the capital
Honiara on Monday in a bid to oust him, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Sasako said, however, that the prime minister would not be
stepping down immediately and the cabinet caucus had accepted an
offer by Malaita Eagle leader Andrew Nori to drop his ultimatum
for Ulufa'alu's resignation by 5 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the caucus decided the matter would be settled at a
specially-convened parliamentary meeting on June 16 at which the
only item on the agenda would be the election of a new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sasako said Nori had withdrawn his ultimatum after being told
by European Union (EU) emissaries in Honiara that the EU would
cancel all aid to a Solomon Islands ruled by unconstitutional
means.
</P>
<P>
The EU provides 25 percent of the impoverished nation's budget.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand have urged Nori and the MEF to pursue
a change of prime minister by constitutional means only.
</P>
<P>
Sasako said Tuesday's development could offer the country a
legal and peaceful way out of its current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
He was hopeful the MEF would on Wednesday withdraw its gunmen
from the prime minister's residence and normal security would be
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu was kept overnight in what the militias called "
protective care" and escorted to Tuesday's meeting by armed MEF
officers.
</P>
<P>
But hopes for an outbreak of peace appeared remote earlier in
the day when 200 guerrilla fighters from the MEF and the rival
Isatabu Freedom Movement fought a three-hour gunbattle on the
fringe of Honiara's airport.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the MEF were wounded in the fighting, according
to unconfirmed reports on local radio.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, at least 50 people have been killed and
thousands made homeless in a dispute between the country's
indigenous Guadalcanal people and Malaitans, brought to the island
during World War II, over land ownership.

<HEADLINE> More Sanctions to Affect Afghans Negatively: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Any additional sanctions on
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia will badly affect the war-
ravaged country, a U.N. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"More sanctions will have negative impact on extremely
vulnerable Afghan population and will add to their difficulties,"
Syed Ahmed Farah, Acting U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan told a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The United States Security Council slapped U.S.-sponsored
economic and aviation sanctions on the Taliban, which controls
over 80 percent of the country, late last year after the militia
refused to hand in alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden for trail.
</P>
<P>
The most severe drought since 1971 all across Afghanistan has
devastated the population who had been extremely vulnerable due to
protracted civil war, the U.N. coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
"Our worry is if additional sanctions were imposed, we will
face violent reaction and our staff will be at risk," Michael
Scakett, Country Director of World Food Program for Afghanistan
said on the same occasion.
</P>
<P>
Scakett recalled that demonstrators attacked U.N. offices in
almost all major Afghan cities after the sanctions were announced
last year.

<HEADLINE> Ten Million Afflicted with Diabetes in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- More than ten million people in
Pakistan are afflicted with diabetes and their number is rising at
an alarming rate, health experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to experts from Pakistan Diabetic Association, at
present Pakistan is ranked at number 15 in the world in the number
of diabetics, but the increasing patients will put the country at
number five in the next 20 years if proper attention is not given
to prevent this deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes develops when the pancreas does not produce enough
insulin or when the body cannot use the insulin properly. This
leads to a buildup of glucose in the blood which can seriously
damage various body organs, especially the blood vessels and
nerves.
</P>
<P>
The experts warned that while education could help in complete
prevention of 80 per cent diabetic complications,public awareness
about the disease is almost negligible in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Concerned About By-Effect of Anti-AIDS Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang on Tuesday expressed concern about the
long-term effects of drugs used to prevent mother-to-child HIV
transmission.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who has been criticized for not making the drugs
available in state clinics, told the National Assembly that no one
would not want to protect unborn children from contracting the
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
However, Tshabalala-Msimang also said there is a lack of
information on how the drugs affect unborn children over time.
</P>
<P>
She said she was looking forward to proposals that could
provide safe and affordable interventions that will help reduce
the risk of HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
Tshabalala-Msimang said since President Thabo Mbeki last year
raised concerns about the toxicity of antiretrovirals, the South
African Medicines Control Council has concluded that the benefits
of AZT outweigh its risks.
</P>
<P>
However, the council further pointed to the fact that the
long-term effects of AZT on children has not been established.
</P>
<P>
A similar observation has also made by the manufacturers of the
drug in its package insert.

<HEADLINE> DFB Chief Pledges to Prevent German Hooligans from Spoiling Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- German Football Federation (DFB)
president Egidius Braun pledged on Tuesday that the federation
would do everything to prevent German hooligans from marring Euro
2000.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will be held from June 10 to July 2 in Belgium
and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We must take all possible preventive measures to avoid any
kind of incident," Braun said after a meeting on security with
North Rhine-Westphalia state interior minister Fritz Behrens in
Duesseldorf. The state borders the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Behrens said those with a record of hooliganism would have to
report to local police and they would be barred from going to the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Any of these people who did not report and attempted to cross
the border would be detained, he added. "We don't want to let a
few violent individuals ruin the reputation of Germany abroad. If
it's necessary we will detain the trouble-makers. Police have
enough cells," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch official said North Rhine-Westphalia police had paid
warning visits to 954 known hooligans in the area.
</P>
<P>
Police estimate the number of the most dangerous hooligans in
the state at about 1,100, with 40 of them having to report
regularly to police during the championships.
</P>
<P>
The tournament's security officials are concerned violence
might flare up when Germany and England, who were drawn in the
same group, meet on July 17 in Charleroi.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are known for soccer hooliganism and ironically
both are bidding to stage the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Four German hooligans were sentenced to jail terms last
November for beating a French policeman almost to death during the
1998 World Cup finals.

NANJING, June 6 (Xinhua) --The train speed on the railway line
between Huangshan, a tourism destination in Anhui Province, and
this capital of Jiangsu Province, will be increased to 80 km per
hour from the present 50 km per hour as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Railways today conducted a
successful experiment on the speed increase on the railway line.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed to raise the speed of trains between the
famous Huangshan Mountain and Nanjing to meet the needs of tourist
development and sharpen the competitive edge of railways, said a
local transportation official.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the site receives an average of four million
visitors and only 10 percent of them go by trains. The speed of
trains on the railway is slow at present since it zigzags across
the mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, beginning October 1, it will take
passenger trains only five hours, about two and half hours less
than now, to travel from Nanjing to Huangshan.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry to WTO "Positive" to Asian Economy:  Supachai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World Trade
Organization will only have "positive" impact on Asian economy,
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said in an
interview with Xinhua here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although we will have to count on Chinese products being more
competitive in the world market, but I think the trade regime of
China will also become more open to all of us," said Supachai,
also Thai commerce minister and designated WTO director-general.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is one of the largest economies in the world,
Supachai said "if China's economy becomes more prosperous, it will
become also a prosperous market for us with a more open trade
system."
</P>
<P>
However, he said he is not afraid that Chinese economy will be
too big and too competitive for the region because "China will be
competitive for certain products while we will be competitive for
other products".
</P>
<P>
"This is what world trade is about," Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Supachai also pointed out that China needs to go through a lot
of adjustments after entering the world trade body, particularly
in the area of legal framework which is concerned with trade laws.
</P>
<P>

trade laws, application of those trade-related laws," he said,
adding that these adjustment will facilitate the international
trade of China and help cut cost for Chinese consumer.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Court Drops Soeharto's Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian court Tuesday threw
out a multimillion defamation lawsuit filed by former president
Soeharto against Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
The decision was hailed by lawyer of the magazine Todung Mulya
Lubis.
</P>
<P>
" Today is happy day for the press because the judge has
demonstrated support of freedom of the press," Lubis told
reporters commenting on the court decision.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto last year lodged a libel lawsuit against Time over an
article published last year which alleged the 78-years old man had
amassed fortune illegally during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Time had reported that Soeharto and his family amassed a
fortune of around 15 billion U.S. dollars during his 32-year
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
"A news article in connection with a presumption or a suspicion
of abuse of power by President Soeharto while he was in power can
be classified as a public necessity. Therefore it was not an act
of defamation," Sihol Sitompul, chief judge at the Central Jakarta
District Court, said in his verdict.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been under investigation for alleged corruption
practices during his 32 years in power. He had sought 183 trillion
rupiah (21.5 billion U.S. dollars) in damages over May 1999
article.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Cybertrading Set to Take off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Cybertrading in Malaysia is
set to take off and will account for 15 percent of all trade by
2003, according to a senior official of Investors Xchange Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The advent of cybertrading would inevitably lead to lower
brokerage fees and commission rates, which in turn would create a
virtuous cycle to drive more Malaysians to trade via the net,
Investors Xchange Managing Director Fahizul Khairi said.
</P>
<P>
With the country gearing up for greater financial
liberalization and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange becoming a
world-class exchange, local brokerage firms would have to move in
step with the rest of the world by providing cybertrading
facilities, together with lower commission rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
Investors Xchange is Malaysia's first independent Internet
financial portal that enables internet trading with participating
equities and futures brokers.

<HEADLINE> UN Launches $67m Emergency Appeal for Drought-hit Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Tuesday
launched a 6.7 million U.S. dollar emergency appeal for the
assistance of the drought-hit people in the war-ravaged
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Launching the appeal at a press briefing here, Acting U.N.
Coordinator for Afghanistan Syed Ahmed Farah said the present
drought response planned by the assistance community for
Afghanistan requires the implementation of projects totaling 67
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Farah said Afghanistan is currently in the grip of the worst
drought since 1971. The next chance for a normal crop from rain-
fed area will not be until 2001 because the vast majority of the
cultivated land produces only one crop per year.
</P>
<P>
While initial assessments showed southwestern Afghanistan to be
the worst affected area, it is now confirmed that the whole
country has been severely affected.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary result of the WFP/FAO crop assessment survey showed
that rain-fed crops in the north failed almost completely. The
Central Highlands are also seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
Due to a combination of war and deprivation, many of the Afghan
people were already highly vulnerable. The current drought, which
has lasted for half a year, has increased difficulties for a wide
segment of the population, Farah aid.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Provide Displaced Angolans with $11Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- UN Office of the High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) will provide the Angolan government with 11
million U.S. dollars, to aid the numerous war-displaced Angolans
living all around the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Angolan ministry of assistance and social
integration Curry Duvall said this amount to will be used to buy
food and clothes, to build houses and temporary residences, and to
acquire other basic necessities for the displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the program, those displaced people
living in the north region of the country, especially in the Uige
province, will be the first beneficiaries of the international
assistance since an office of the organization will soon be
established in the Uige city, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those displaced Angolans who had returned to their
homeland from Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will
also benefit from the aid, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In the year of 2001, namely the second phase of the UNHCR
program, the assistance will be expanded to all parts of the
southwest African country, which currently has some 3.7 million
displaced persons, accounting for 30 percent of the total
population.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Gov't Contributes Petrol Price Hike to Reliance on Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Information Minister Jerry
Gana Monday contributed the recent 50 percent petrol price hike
to the African largest oil producing country's awkward reliance on
foreign petrol imports.
</P>
<P>
He said in the country's capital Abuja that Nigeria imported 75
percent of the domestic consumed petrol products from foreign
countries, which left it no choice but to accept price offered by
the sellers, reported Nigerian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To press down the price on domestic market, Nigerian government
had to spent billions of naira (100 naira equal one U. S. dollar
) in the first quarter alone this year on subsidizing fuel.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of some of the country's refineries, due to years
of mismanagement, also contributed to the heavier reliance on the
imported fuel, thus to the petrol price hike, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He regretted the economic effects the increment may have on the
country' s average families, but appealed to them to understand
the rationale behind the hike.
</P>
<P>
With money saved from the subsidization, "I can assure you that
we can make this country better and be able to implement the 25
percent yearly increment for civil servants... without
retrenchments; even our railway systems and other serious economic
sectors will be better off," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Gana made the appeal at a time when large-scale protests were
seen throughout the country to protest the petrol price hike. The
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC), the country's largest labor
organization, had also called upon its members and other workers
to begin a "seat at home" strike from Thursday June 8, if the
federal government did not rescind the increase petrol price.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government on last Thursday rose the country's petrol
price by 50 percent to 30 naira from 20 (100 naira equals about
one U. S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision had met with mixed reactions in the Africa's
largest oil producing country. People in the business sector
generally welcomed the move despite the costs added to their
operation, saying it is inevitable to reduce the large amount of
money spent on subsidizing for a low petrol price.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Accuses Rwanda of Provocation in Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda accused Rwanda Patriotic
Army (RPA) here Tuesday of conducting provocative action by
attacking on a vehicle of the Uganda People's Defence Forces
(UPDF) in Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Uganda condemns in the strongest terms this
aimless and criminal provocation against an army committed to
withdrawal from Kisangani," said James Wapakabulo, chairman of
the committee on the region, at a press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF vehicle, which was escorted by a vehicle of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Congo (MONUC), was fired at Monday
morning first by small arms and then by a shell which destroyed
it.
</P>
<P>
Later fighting broke out between UPDF and RPA in Kisangani, and
it continued this morning.
</P>
<P>
Wapakabulo said that the Ugandan government calls on the
Rwandan government to respect its commitment to the Lusaka
cease-fire Agreement, the Rwakitura Joint declaration and the
withdrawal plan.
</P>
<P>
"The Ugandan government also expresses its disappointment at
the U.N.'s failure to condemn up to now the irresponsible and
provocative actions committed by the RPA in the presence of U.N.
personnel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wapakabulo said Uganda has proposed to MONUC that both sides
cease fire immediately, simultaneously withdraw troops of RPA and
UPDF from their current positions in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the withdrawal should be during the daytime
under the supervision of MONUC, not during the night.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda remains committed to Lusaka cease-fire Agreement and
the demilitarization of Kisangani plan as the only viable way
forward in resolving the crisis in the DRC," Wapakabulo said.

<HEADLINE> Rich Countries' Huge Subsidy Weakens Poor Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The World Bank Chief Economist and Sector Director for Africa
Region Alan Gelb told a news conference here on Monday that the
developed world annual investment in agriculture is almost equal
to combined Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank would like to see a reverse of this set up
which has made African commodities lose their world market share
because of high prices," Gelb said, while launching a report
entitled "Can Africa Claim The 21st Century?"
</P>
<P>
He said that development of the agricultural sector in Africa
was also crippled by excessive taxation, however, about 80
percent of the taxation was siphoned to develop the
infrastructure in towns.
</P>
<P>
However, Gelb said, under the World Trade Organization rules,
industrial countries would be forced to withdraw completely
subsidizing the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
"This move is likely to benefit developing countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The report was jointly published by the World Bank, the Africa
Development Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa, the Global Coalition for Africa and the Africa Research
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
It challenges African governments to practice trade policies
which will encourage export oriented production.
</P>
<P>
Gelb's remarks come in wake of heated public debate on the
decision made by the Tanzania Government to abolish its farm
subsidies since early 1990s under pressure from donors.
</P>
<P>
The backbone of Tanzania's ailing economy, the agricultural
sector employs over 80 percent of Tanzanians and accounts for
over 75 percent of foreign currency earnings. However, the
sector cannot yet feed the Tanzanians throughout the year, though
the government promised to invest 75 million US dollars in the
sector in the next fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Incompetent Road Contractors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will not allow
incompetent and unscrupulous contractors to carry out government
projects in road maintenance and construction, a senior official
has warned.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Works Solomon
Odunga, was quoted by local newspapers Tuesday, made the remarks
at a workshop here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I challenge all those contractors who have constantly been
doing unsatisfactory works in construction, maintenance and
rehabilitation of our roads, bridges, buildings and other public
structures to work more diligently," he said. "Otherwise, they
will find themselves out of business."
</P>
<P>
He said the government executive agency, the Tanzania National
Road Agency (TANROADS) responsible for developing and maintaining
roads on behalf of the government, would operate on commercial
principles.
</P>
<P>
TANROADS, established by the Executive Agencies Act, 1997, will
start operating next month.
</P>
<P>
Odung also challenged the Contractors Registration Board (CRB)
to strictly follow commercial principles in allocating contracts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the CRB Chairman Malima Bundara said that more than 95
percent of construction work in Tanzania was being carried out by
foreign contractors.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is too big to depend on foreign contractors," he
added. "The construction of schools, dispensaries, churches, rural
roads and water supply schemes are ideal projects for local
contractors."
</P>
<P>
Bundara called for deliberate measures from all stakeholders to
improve the situation of local contractors, who managed less than
30 percent of all projects only in terms of the value of the
construction work.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, intended to review the status of various
strategies, attracted foreign and local contractors, clients,
members of the donor community, consultants, engineers, architects
and other professionals in the construction industry.

<HEADLINE> WTO Dispute Settlement System Deals Nearly 200 Cases Since 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The unique dispute settlement system
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has dealt with nearly 200
trade disputes since its establishment in January, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It is a resounding vote of confidence in the WTO's dispute
settlement system that the 136 member governments, both large and
small, have so often sought solutions to difficult problems
through our organization," WTO Director General Mike Moore said at
a press conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 194 cases filed during the period between January, 1995
and May, 2000, 77 disputes were resolved, of which 41 were solved
without going to adjudication, according to statistics released
by the organization.
</P>
<P>
"Without this system, it would be virtually impossible to
maintain the delicate balance of international rights and
obligations," Moore said. "Disputes would drag on much longer,
have a destabilizing effect on international trade, which, in turn,
could poison international relations in general. The system's
emphasis on negotiating a settlement could serve the same
governments equally well in other areas of international relations.
"
</P>
<P>
Low-income nations are enjoying the benefits of the dispute
settlement system, which accords the smallest members the same
weight as the bigger trading nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries as a group have registered 50 of the 194
disputes, with India, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand playing the most
active roles. The United States and the European Commission have
registered the most complaints at the WTO, with 60 and 50
respectively, and are also the most frequently cited by other
governments as not being in compliance with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
"The dispute settlement mechanism, moreover, is unique in the
international architecture. WTO member governments bind themselves
to the outcome from panels and, if necessary, the Appellate Body,"
said the chief. "That's why the WTO has attracted so much
attention from all sorts of groups who wish to use this mechanism
to advance their interests."

<HEADLINE> Terrorism in Turkey Against Iranian Interests: Iranian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammad Adeli denied reports that Tehran wants to destabilize
Turkey through a series of political killings amid allegations that
Iran plotted the bombing of a Pan-Am jet in 1988 which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Adeli arrived in Turkey as Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's
special envoy to present Turkish President Ahmet Sezer with
Khatami's invitation to the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)
summit to be held in Tehran on June 10, Turkish Daily News reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said it is against Iranian interests that Turkey is embedded
in terrorism, adding that Tehran is disappointed over discussions
blaming Iran for destabilizing Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Seyyid Behbahani, an Iranian defector to Turkey, claimed in his
testimony that he had been an agent of the Iranian intelligence
organization, and some known terror actions which took place in
Turkey and other places had been masterminded by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Adeli strongly denied the allegations, saying that "Iran had no
relations with this person or other individuals or groups which
might have been involved in violence against Turkey or any other
country."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Turkey should make utmost efforts to
remain calm and build mutual confidence which should prevail
between the different cultures and peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Iranian official said that following Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon, Turkey had started to comply with
Israel's request to control Iranian flights over its national
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The official said that "some planes which carry humanitarian aid
to Syria are controlled by Turkey," expressing concerns over
growing ties between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
that "Turkey has the right to control flights over its national
airspace. Turkey exercises this right whenever it chooses to."

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands PM Indicates to Stand Down: ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the Solomon Islands'
parliamentary caucus on Tuesday has ended with Prime Minister
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu apparently indicating he would be prepared
to step down, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
His resignation has been one of the key demands made by the
militia which Monday put him under house arrest and seized weapons
and key installations in the capital, Honiara, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted the Solomon Islands Minister of State Alfred
Sasako as saying the resignation is expected to take effect from
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If that is the price, if his resignation is the price of peace
and the return to normalcy in the country then, yes, he is
prepared to do that," Sasako said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander
Downer has described the development as profoundly disturbing, the
ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Downer was responding shortly before he entered a meeting of
the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in London.
</P>
<P>
"My initial reaction is that he was put into a position at the
end of a barrel of a gun to resign, and that, of course, is what
is profoundly disturbing and regrettable," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the prime minister resigned as a result of a vote of a
caucus meeting or a vote in the Parliament, of course, is a
domestic matter for another country but the circumstances which
led to his resignation are obviously profoundly disturbing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, fighting broke out between armed members of the
opposing militia groups in the Solomon Islands.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Bad Loans Continue to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The non-performing loans (NPL) of
Thai financial sector are continuing to decrease, Thai official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-artham said in a report
Tuesday that by the end of April, the country's NPL has dropped to
1.95 trillion baht (50 billion U.S. dollars), or 36.5% of the
total loans, down 50 billion baht (1.3 billion dollars) from March.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Bad loans had peaked at 2.55 trillion baht (66
billion dollars), or 47.7% of the total loans, in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Thailand's NPLs are expected to decline
to 23% by the end of the year as banks are struggling to
reconstruct their debts.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand, the central bank, even predicted the final
figure could be trimmed to only 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand's Corporate Debt Restructuring Advisory
Committee said that since the number of debtors seeking
restructuring of their debts is still short of the targeted number
of 1.6 debtors per month, the pace of NPL restructuring is still
kept slow.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia launched Tuesday an
information technology (IT) center for the hearing impaired, the
first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The center will give the hearing impaired a chance not to get
left behind in the IT race," Mohamed Sazali Shaari, president of
the Malaysian Hearing Impaired Federation, said through a sign
language interpreter at a press conference during the launching
here.
</P>
<P>
The disabled group, especially children, are also interested in
IT and the Internet, he said, adding the main obstacle faced by
the hearing impaired group is the lack of trainers who understand
sign language.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 20 percent of those in the hearing impaired
group in Malaysia have an understanding of IT.
</P>
<P>
The center will provide IT training for hearing impaired pupils
from various special primary and secondary schools.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Students Protest against Petrol Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian College students Monday
protested in Lagos and many other southeastern cities against the
recent petrol hike.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of major Nigerian newspapers, the
protesters demanded an immediate reversal of the prices and vowed
to resist any slash, which would result in even marginal
increases.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Adams Oshiomhole, president of Nigeria Labor
Congress (NLC), the country's largest labor organization
foreclosed any compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Oshiomhole urged at an emergency press conference in Lagos that
 all Nigerian workers must ensure that "all the petrol stations
across the country are boycotted or shut down from operating
until prices are reverted to the old rates."
</P>
<P>
Most of the gas stations in Lagos remained shut on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Oshiomhole said the NLC was not to attend a meeting organized
on Tuesday by the federal government to discuss the hike. "We are
not going to meet with them until after our mass rally," said the
Labor leader.
</P>
<P>
The NLC last week called upon its members and other Nigerian
workers to begin a "seat at home" strike from Thursday June 8, if
the federal government did not rescind the increase petrol price.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government on last Thursday rose the country's petrol
price by 50 percent to 30 naira from 20 (100 naira equals about
one U. S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision had met with mixed reactions in the Africa's
largest oil producing country. People in the business sector
generally welcomed the move despite the costs added to their
operation, saying it is inevitable to reduce the large amount of
money spent on subsidizing for a low petrol price.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Africa Ready to Face Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is worried that the
economic globalization could further widen the huge gap between
the rich nations and the poor, especially African countries, local
newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa told a conference here on Monday that
Africa should be nurtured to build the capacity of local
entrepreneurs to compete with foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
He said capacity building and the attraction of foreign
investment must go hand in hand to ensure the economies of
developing countries are not wiped out under the wave of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address to the two-day Conference on the New
Strategy for Denmark Development Assistance Policy, Mkapa said
that Tanzania that depends heavily on farm exports for most of its
hard currency earnings is very worried about rich countries'
subside on their agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"Rich countries spend 300 billion U.S. dollars to subside and
protect their own farmers against foreign competition," he said.
"This figure is as large as Africa's total economic output."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there is something wrong if milk from the European
Union is to sell cheaper in Dar es Salaam than milk from Dar es
Salaam," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted that developing countries need greater support from
their developed partners to make trade with outside world more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tanzania, with about 80 percent of its people
living in rural areas, must increase production in agricultural
sector as well as boost non- agricultural sectors such as
small-scale industries and labor-intensive public works in its
efforts to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa underscored the importance of cooperatives in promoting
and defending collective interests of the farmers, calling on the
donors to assist the revival of the organization.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperatives empower people by virtue of their individual
membership and strengthen unity among the farmers," he said
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed that donors and the developing countries must
learn to be more focused, targeted and realistic on what could be
done within what time frame work with the available domestic and
external confirmed resources.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the donor-established projects collapsed because they
did not have strategies to develop their sustainability," he said.
"One way to help redress the shortcoming is to have clear training
programs for local people to take over from expatriates in a bid
to ensure managerial and technical competence and sustainability."
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the government of Denmark, brought
together participants from Benin, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Eritrea,
Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Uganda,
Tanzania and Zambia as well as from international organization and
donors.

<P>
ASTANA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will offer 100,000 U.S.
dollars to their gold medal winners at this year's Sydney Olympic
Games, according to reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our government will pay $100,000, $50,000 and $30,000
respectively to each athlete, who wins gold, silver and bronze
medals -- the same amount we paid our winners in Atlanta four
years ago," chairman of the Kazakh State Sports Committee Daulet
Turlykhanov was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, for the first time we also decided to pay
coaches whose athletes win Olympic titles at least $50,000,"
Turlykhanov continued.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan won 11 medals, three of them gold, at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics and want at least to match that showing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's best medal hopes lie in boxing and Greco-Roman
and freestyle wrestling.

<P>
McDonald's, which will remain the exclusive retail food
service provider for the games, has been involved with the

-- Ancient Town of Military Importance Found in Central China
</P>
<P>
A rare and remarkably well-preserved town of military
importance has been discovered in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The square-shaped town, surrounded by a 1,200-meter rampart,
occupies less than 90,000 square meters of land. The northern and
western walls, built from mud and sticks, stand two to three
meters high -- probably their original height, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said it's the smallest town ever discovered in
the province, which they believed was built in the early Shang
Dynasty (around 1500 B.C.).
</P>
<P>

which was excavated from a layer dating back to 120 million years
in northeast China's Liaoning Province and later smuggled out of
the country.

</P>
<P>
The 3,000-square-meter museum is home to 11,000 relics,
including three state treasures and 117 state-level cultural
relics. These items combined account for more than 50 percent of
the region's total collection of precious historical pieces.

</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to start a massive restoration and
salvation project to save the world's tallest ancient wooden
pagoda in north Shanxi Province, which, in its 944 years of
existence, is in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, chief of the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage, said that the final version of the restoration plan will
make no consideration of cost, as long as it works best for
protecting the pagoda and preserving its original look.

</P>
<P>
Liuyang, situated in northeastern Hunan, was the main site of
the Autumn Harvest Uprising, an armed uprising led by Comrade Mao
Zedong in 1927 along the Hunan-Jiangxi border. The uprising marked
the Party's independence as a revolutionary army.

Thousands of Beijing residents on May 29 rushed to the Poly Art
Museum for an exhibition of three Chinese national treasures
looted by British and French troops when they invaded Beijing in
1860.
</P>
<P>
The antiques are bronze heads of an ox, a tiger, and a monkey,
three of the 12 animal sculptures in a water clock designed for
the Yuanmingyuan Palace, described as one of the most splendid
gardens in the world. The three pieces were recovered at auctions
in Hong Kong and the Poly Group Corporation of China bought them
for more than 33.17 million Hong Kong dollars.

Arafat on Tuesday. She is also scheduled to visit Cairo on
Wednesday, where she is to meet with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with Barak Monday night,
Albright said "we are there ready to roll up our sleeves to help"

added that this is "a historic time, and decisions have to be
made."

weeks, threatens to erupt Wednesday if an early election bill
sponsored by Knesset (parliament) member Avigdor Lieberman reaches
the Knesset for a vote.

<P>
Tension between Barak and the religious party's leadership took
a rapid turn for the worse Monday. Responding to a Shas threat to
vote against the government on Lieberman's measure if its demands
for allocations to its educational network are not met, Barak
ordered his professional teams to stop talks with Shas.
</P>
<P>
Barak declared that he isn't prepared to conduct negotiations

implicit.

<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. special envoy Terje Larsen is heading another
mission in the region to resolve outstanding points over the
precise location of what the U.N. refers to as the "withdrawal
line."
</P>

Diplomatic sources hope that the stumbling blocks will be
overcome in a few days, and the U.N will then be able to complete
the process of verifying Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court meted prison terms to five
men convicted of negligence offenses in a bridge collapse incident

killed in the Ramat Gan tragedy, and 69 were injured.

in the affair, and handed prison terms of varying lengths from nine
months to 21 months.

<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's monthly tax revenues hit an all-time high
of 13.02 billion shekels (3.25 billion U.S. dollars) in May, up 18.
8 percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the year, tax revenues totaled 62.
15 billion shekels (15.54 billion dollars), 20.3 percent over the
same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials warned, however, that though the increase
clearly points to economic growth, it is not necessarily an
indication of the magnitude of the boom.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israel Export Institute has set up a
computerized database of investors, managers and marketing
personnel for software companies, in an effort to help them
penetrate overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli software exports totalled 2.2 billion dollars in 1999,
which constituted 45 percent of the country's total service
exports.
</P>
<P>
The investment database comprises 200 investment institutions in
the United States and western Europe, including venture capital
funds and investment banks.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Union Bank of Israel will hold its initial public
offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on Wednesday, with the goal
of raising at least 169 million shekels (62.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of this sum, 64 million shekels (16 million dollars) will come
from the sale of shares to bank employees.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also issue options which, if fully exercised, will
bring in an additional 140 million shekels (35 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Unhappy With Annan's Reference on Missing Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A parliamentary delegation of Cyprus
will travel to New York to meet United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to discuss the missing persons issue of the island,
local media reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his recent report on renewing the six-month mandate of the
UNFICYP's (U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus), Annan said he will
not appoint another U.N. member to the Committee for Missing
Persons (CMP), composed of representatives also from the two
communities of Cyprus, until the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
show a "genuine committment to reaching a consensus on the issue of
missing persons."
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Ritter, the former U.N.-appointed member of the
tripartite CMP, died in January.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said such a
point of view took no account of the agreement on the issue of
missing persons reached between President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, Clerides and Denktash agreed to exchange
information on the location of graves, but efforts appear to have
been snagged as the Greek Cypriots accused the Turkish Cypriot side
of non-cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This reference is not fair to our side and completely overlooks
the July 1997 agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou also accused that the reference put on an equal
footing the legal armed forces of the Republic of Cyprus and the
Turkish army, which has been occupying the Turkish Cypriots-
populated northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou also said "Annan's
position is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots were listed as missing persons
soon after the 1974 incident.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side refused to return to talks on the
missing persons, saying the Greek Cypriot side included people
killed in the coup on the list of missing persons.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side unilaterally started last summer a
process of exhumation and identification of remains of the dead and
missing persons in the 1974 war from two local cemeteries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Governor Urged to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Speaker of the Indonesia's
House of Representatives (DPR) Muhaimin Iskandar here Tuesday
asked Governor of Bank Indonesia (the central bank) Syahril
Sabirin to resign from his post following his alleged involvement
in a bank scandal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Iskandar said," I think it would be
better if Syahril Sabirin resign from his position as governor (of
the central bank). Because in this case he was declared as a
suspect by the Attorney General Office."
</P>
<P>
However, Speaker of the DPR Akbar Tandjung insisted that, "the
principle of presumption of innocent have to be erected in
handling the Bank Bali case and let the court decides. And it will
better for us to wait."
</P>
<P>
He urged Sabirin to remain in his post "until the court finds
him guilty in the scandal."
</P>
<P>
Sabirin was named on Monday as suspect in the country's Bank
Bali scandal for allegedly violating the central bank's prudential
principle in its policy to reimburse interbank loans guaranteed by
the government.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around Bank Indonesia's reimbursement of
904 billion rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in defaulted loans
to other banks. There is a suspicion that a large portion of the
money went to help bankroll then president B.J. Habibie's
renomination bid.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Face Dry Weather in Next Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- For the next four months,
three-quarters of Kenya will remain dry as the expected rains will
not alleviate the current drought, local meteorologists have
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Meteorological Department predicted that water and
power problems will persist for the next four months as of June,
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The only season that would turn around the sorry situation is
the October-December rains," said Evans Mukolwe, head of the
meteorological department.
</P>
<P>
Mukolwe said in the next months, only the Lake Victoria basin,
the western highlands and the southern coastal region will receive
significant rainfall, while other parts of the country would
experience below-normal rainfall.  !!
</P>
<P>
Mukolwe also mentioned that apart from southern Tanzania, other
parts of East Africa are experiencing severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The department said Kenya is facing one of the longest and
severest droughts since 1984, and a number of locations in the
country recorded the lowest rainfall totals during this year's
long rains (March to May) in the past 40 years.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Claims Recovering Tesseney Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean troops have recaptured
the western town of Tesseney after a day-long battle with
Ethiopian army, according to a news release from the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian troops consisting of one division and two
brigades were totally routed at around 9:00 p.m. on Monday, the
release claimed.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accused the Ethiopian army of demolishing all major
public and commercial facilities as well as private homes in
Barentu, east of Tesseney.
</P>
<P>
The news release said that Ethiopia continued to reject the
call by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to withdraw fully
from western Eritrea and still occupy a number of Eritrean towns
in the agriculturally rich part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea claimed that Ethiopia's design is aimed at "delaying
and preventing the early return of the displaced people so as to
disrupt agricultural production during the critical month of June
when the rains are due".
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of Eritrea's agricultural production comes from
the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia declared on May 31 that the war was over. The
announcement was made while it claimed to have recovered all
occupied territories from Eritrea, and attained all its military
objects.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are now involved in a new round of indirect
peace talks brokered by the OAU in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting in a two-year-old border conflict
between the two Horn of Africa neighbors erupted on May 12.

<HEADLINE> EX-AUM Member Given Life Term For Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday
sentenced former AUM Shinrikyo member Yoshihiro Inoue to life in
prison for murder and other crimes related to 1995 sarin nerve gas
attack on the Tokyo subway system that killed 12 people and
injured thousands, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Inoue, 30, was one of the closest aides to AUM founder Shoko
Asahara. In addition to the murder of the sarin gas attack victims,
he was found guilty of taking part in other cases of murder and
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutors have demanded the death sentence for
Inoue, but the call was rejected by the presiding judge on the
ground that the defendant did not play an active role in the
crimes, such as releasing sarin in the subway trains.
</P>
<P>
Koichi Ueda, a senior official at the Tokyo District Public
Prosecutors Office, said he did not expect the ruling to be life
imprisonment for such serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Ueda said he plans to appeal the ruling after discussing the
case with the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office.
</P>
<P>
The court also rejected a defense plea that Inoue followed
Asahara's orders under "mind control", therefore, he was not fully
responsible for his actions.
</P>
<P>
A 29-year-old woman whose father was killed in the sarin attack
was quoted by Kyodo as saying, "It was a completely unexpected
ruling. I'm confused, to be honest."
</P>
<P>
Takeshi Tsuchimoto, a professor of the Penal Code at Teikyo
University, told the Japanese news agency that the court should
have handed down the death penalty, because Inoue planned,
prepared and carried out so many lethal crimes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes False Claim Over Lockerbie Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Intelligence Minister Ali
Yunesi has refuted a claim by the alleged defector Ahmad Behbahani
that Iran was behind the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Denying any links with Behabahani, the minister said that since
the establishment of the Iranian Intelligence Ministry, no person
named Ahmad Behbahani has worked with the ministry, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States' Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) disclosed
on Sunday that Behbahani, who claimed himself former head of the
ministry's department in charge of foreign terrorism activities,
said Iran planned and carried out the 1988 bombing.
</P>
<P>
Behbahani, living in a foreign asylum-seeker camp in Turkey,
said that he had been responsible for all "terrorist" operations
carried out by the Iranian government beyond its borders until he
had crossed the border to Turkey four months ago following a rift
with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He said that a group of Libyans received 90 days of training in
Iran to carry out the bombing after he persuaded Ahmad Jibril, who
heads a Syrian-backed armed group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, into accepting the plan.
</P>
<P>
In response to Behbahani's claim, Yunesi told IRNA on Monday
that those Iranians who wish to be granted asylum in the Western
countries usually try to achieve their aims through baseless
statements or slanders against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said the "contradictory" remarks of Behbahani proves the
falseness of his claims since he claimed to be imprisoned in Iran
in 1998 while claiming to be a top official with the Iranian
Intelligence Ministry in the same period.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Tuesday he was optimistic that the Indonesia's
unity will remain intact.
</P>
<P>
"I have never worried about disintegration (threats) in this
country," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
With his new statement, it seems that Wahid also played down on
what is happening in the resource-rich province of Papua recently.
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry at all. And I am sure that the Indonesia's unity
will remain intact," Wahid said, referring to what is happening in
the province.
</P>
<P>
He also said that based on a historical point of view Papua
province has a strong commitment for integration with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Papua National Congress declared on Sunday that the
province will be no longer a part of the unitary state of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But earlier the president vowed to take some measures against
all activities aimed at declaring an independent Papua, saying
that the government would also not recognize the results of the
congress as its organization was not in line with the agreement
reached by the government and the congress organizing committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a powerful
earthquake in Bengkulu on Indonesia's Sumatra island rose to 103
and leaving 500 injured on Tuesday noon, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the death toll would likely continue to
rise as they had not been able to contact the worst-hit areas,
including Enggano island which lies close to the earthquake's
epicenter and is home to 1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams were trying to push into remote parts of Bengkulu
province, but were hampered by bad weather, severed communications
and the closure of the region's airport.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a government emergency task force as saying
that 64 bodies had been recovered from rubble in Bengkulu town.
The rest were killed in other parts.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency said more than 500 people had been
injured, half of them seriously. Doctors in the provincial capital
of Bengkulu were struggling with a shortage of beds, medicine and
blood and were treating victims in hospital parking lots.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Acting Coordinating Minister for Political and
Security Affairs Surjadi Sudirdja said Indonesia needed
international assistance.
</P>
<P>
"In this situation we expect help. The situation now is worse.
Because the airport cannot be used, it is hampering the arrival of
aid. So aid will be delivered by sea and land. Maybe we will use
military helicopters to drop food," the minister told reporters
after meeting President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two Indonesian Navy ships were bringing
emergency supplies. Rescue personnel were being deployed from
other parts of Indonesia, and some foreign countries had offered
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The strong earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale hit
Bengkulu on Sunday mid-night when most residents were sleeping.
The epicenter of the quake was located 112 kilometers from
Bengkulu. More than 300 aftershocks have been recorded since the
tumble hit.
</P>
<P>
The tumble was also felt in the coastal areas of West Sumatra,
South Sumatra, Lampung and West Java, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or casualties there.
</P>
<P>
Expert from the Bandung Institute of Technology Sikgit Sukmono
said Sunday's quake resulted from a movement in the Indo-Australia
tectonic plate.
</P>
<P>
It was the second major earthquake to jolt Indonesia within
less than two months. A quake measuring 5.2 on Richter Scale and a
subsequent tsunami hit Luwuk-Banggai island in Central Sulawesi
earlier last month, leaving 45 people dead.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Gov't Accuses Rebels of Forcibly  Conscripting Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government Tuesday
accused Tamil Tiger rebels of forcibly conscripting civilians in
northern Jaffna peninsula under the cover of a one-day unilateral
cease-fire late last month.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of males and females including school children
from Kaithady and Ariyalai areas who were forced to move into
Wanni ... have been conscripted ... and are presently undergoing
military training in the Wanni," said a government statement.
</P>
<P>
The accusation came as the government claimed that over 1,000
rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been killed
and twice that number have been wounded in the recent battles in
Jaffna where the rebels are experiencing an acute manpower
shortage.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern parts since 1983, have
been engaged in a ferocious assault over the past two months in a
bid to retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebel offensive seem to be dying down as only
sporadic fighting has been reported for the past week.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Palitha Fernando said LTTE transmissions had
revealed the names of 650 rebels killed in various clashes in the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
He said the morale of the government troops in Jaffna is high
as the government has rushed modern weaponry systems and
reinforcements to beef up the defenses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government accused LTTE rebels of blocking the
movement of civilians under its control in the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The government statement said the LTTE rebels have refused to
allow civilians to cross over to the government-controlled areas
in Jaffna despite arrangements made by the government to open an
entry point in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It said the rebels instead are forcing civilians to move into
the northern jungle region of Wanni.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Grants Loan to Kenya's Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank has
granted a loan of 41 million euros (about 38.7 million U.S.
dollars) to Kenya for the construction of sub-station and
transmission line of the Olkaria II power station, local
newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of the Energy Ministry Mwanyengela Ngali
disclosed it Monday when he led the European Investment Bank
officials on a tour of the Olkaria Geothermal Power Project near
Naivasha in central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ngali said the European bank also financed the third unit of
the existing Olkaria I Power Station built in 1985 at a cost of
144 million shillings (around two million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He noted that geological studies indicate that Kenya has a
geothermal potential of over 2,000 megawatts, equal to the hydro
potential of the River Nile in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Kenya's bilateral partners to assist in the
exploitation of the resources, saying this could help reduce over
dependence on hydropower generation in the country.
</P>
<P>
kenya began power rationing last September due to a two-year
drought leading to the fast drop of the water levels of major
reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government introduced a 12-hour power rationing
schedule nationwide until the onset of the short rains in October.

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Rehabilitation Way for Drug Addicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese mandatory drug-relief
centers have explored new ways of weaning drug addicts off the
habit by encouraging them to join deep sea fishing operations or
farming rather than staying in rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang Huiyun was among the 24 drug addicts in Qionghai City,
Hainan, who have been sent to join in the fishing operations in
the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
After seven months away from any possible access to drugs,
Zhuang has found a relief from drug-reliance and his life returned
to normal.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15,000 people have been affected by narcotics in
this southernmost island province, which account for 2.5 per
thousand of its total population.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the criminal cases are related with drug
smuggling and selling.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation centers are working hard in the anti-drug
campaign. In addition to providing education and rehabilitation,
the centers compile their personal documents of the reformed drug
users in computer and ask them to do urine test every half a year.
</P>
<P>
This method also helps reduce the cost needed in the anti-drug
effort.
</P>
<P>
The Qionghai city government last year designated a 0.8-ha
farmland to the local drug-relief center for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
This method has been used in Chengdu, capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province and the neighboring Yunnan Province where
many so-called "Drug-Proof Zones" have been set up to help the
rehabilitation efforts of drug users.

BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in clearing
away the landmines within its territory after two campaigns of
minesweeping, the Liberation Army Daily reported today.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The two campaigns have ridded the areas of 1.88 million
landmines and 320,000 pieces of other explosives. A total of 60,
000 hectares of farming land and forests have been reclaimed in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The successful minesweeping has resulted in the reopening of
290 border passages and ports, bringing prosperity to the border
areas.

<HEADLINE> Tarim River Should Be Harnessed: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Experts have suggested that the
ecologically deteriorating Tarim River in northwest China should
be harnessed as part of the state's efforts to put in order major
rivers,
</P>
<P>
A group of academicians from the Division of Biological Science
of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences have already
presented the suggestion to the central government, according to a
meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
To protect the environment and ecology of the river's valley,
more efforts should be made to control the water usage in the
upper reaches, bring under control the middle reaches and protect
the green belt in the lower part, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The harnessing of the middle reaches is expected to add two to
three billion cubic meters of water to the present volume of the
river.
</P>
<P>
The experts also suggested that the water usage by local
enterprises should be rationed so as to ensure the sustainable
development of the ecological environment of the valley.
</P>
<P>
As the longest inland river of the country, Tarim runs 1,321
kilometers and nurtures a population of 7.8 million in the arid
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the ecological environment of the Tarim valley
has been deteriorating, especially in the lower reaches of the
river.
</P>
<P>
The drying out of the river in some sections has resulted in
the dropping of underground water levels, the worsening of water
quality and the abandoning of farming land.
</P>
<P>
The degradation of natural vegetation in the valley has also
contributed to the enlarging of Taklimakan and other deserts.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that human factors, such as the large-scale
reclaiming of wasteland, the primitive methods of irrigation and
poor water conservancy facilities, are responsible for the rapidly
worsening of the river's ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The river's harnessing will benefit not only the ecological
environment, but also the sustainable development of the multi-
ethnic region, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
Initial progress has already been achieved in the nation's
efforts to harness the country's major rivers and lakes such as
the Huaihe River, Liaohe River and the Taihu Lake.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Link With Alleged Defector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Intelligence Minister Ali
Yunesi has denied any links between his ministry and the alleged
defector Ahmad Behbahani, who claimed that Iran was behind the 1998
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Iranian Intelligence Ministry, no
person named Ahmad Behbahani has worked with the ministry, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on Tuesday quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The United States CBS television broadcast on Sunday that
Behbahani, who claimed himself former head of the ministry's
department in charge of foreign terrorism activities, said Iran
planned and carried out the 1998 bombing which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Behbahani, living in a foreign asylum-seeker camp in Turkey,
said that he had been responsible for all "terrorist" operations
carried out by the Iranian government beyond its borders until he
had crossed the border to Turkey four months ago following a rift
with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He said that a group of Libyans received 90 days of training in
Iran to carry out the bombing after he persuaded Ahmad Jibril, who
heads a Syrian-backed armed group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, into accepting the plan.
</P>
<P>
In response to Behbahani's claim, Yunesi told IRNA on Monday
that those Iranians who wish to be granted asylum in the Western
countries are usually trying to achieve their aims through baseless
statements or slanders against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said the "contradictory" remarks of Behbahani proves the
falseness of his claims since he claims to have been imprisoned in
Iran in 1998 while claiming to be a top official with the Iranian
Intelligence Ministry in the same period.

<P>
The DPRK's proposal was contained in a press release issued
Monday by the DPRK Embassy in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The release, which was circulated Tuesday at the New Zealand
Parliament, said the DPRK is "fully prepared to begin diplomatic
contacts with New Zealand, if Wellington agrees to the proposal on
opening diplomatic ties."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's proposal follows the recent statement by New Zealand
Prime Minister Helen Clark in favor of such a relationship between
the two countries. The prime minister told the New Zealand
Institute of International Affairs in Wellington on May 26 that
her country would probably follow Australia's example and
eventually establish diplomatic links with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The release said DPRK welcomes Clark's statement as "an
important indication of New Zealand's foreign policy development,
being consistent with the recent movement in Asia-Pacific that
further promotes confidence-building process and cooperation in
the region."
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK is of the view that establishment of diplomatic
relations will make a significant contribution to greater peace
and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific, to which the two countries
belong,"it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- With three weeks to go before
Zimbabwean parliamentary elections, police Monday said they are
winning the fight against political violence, the daily Herald
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There has been a notable decrease in the number of political
violence incidents reported countrywide in the past week, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 people were killed, 450 others arrested and property
worth millions of U.S. dollars destroyed since the countrywide
outbreak of political violence in February.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, police spokesman Chief Superintendent
Wayne Bvudzijena said that though there were some cases still
being reported the number of incidents was on the decrease.
</P>
<P>
He cited last weekend's peaceful filing of election candidates
saying people have now realized that the outcome of the elections
will be decided by the ballot and not violence.
</P>
<P>
He said police force will continue to deploy its officers to
all parts of the country ahead of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will hold the fifth parliamentary elections on June 24
and 25.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Vows to Punish Crimes of Environment Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Minister for Environment
has warned that those found polluting the environment will be
prosecuted since the environmental law is in force.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper quoted Francis Nyenze on Tuesday as
saying that his ministry will crack down on companies without
necessary facilities to treat wastes.
</P>
<P>
Nyenze said that some companies had dumped sewage into rivers,
causing untold suffering to human and marine life and a big chunk
of the health budget to treat water-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the celebrations of the World Environment Day in
the Kenyan town of Thika, he also urged the Castle Brewing Company
(South Africa) in the town to speed up the construction of their
treatment plant in order to improve the ecosystem of the area.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the current drought that is ravaging
the country can partly be blamed on the deforestation and appealed
to Kenyans to plant trees to offset desertification.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will not condone people who destroy
forests, especially in the catchment areas.

</P>
<P>
Of the seven currently active wildfires across the country, the
largest is in northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
One blaze, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, New Mexico, has
forced hundreds of people to evacuate from the pine forest east of
Santa Fe. The week-long fire had increased to 28,283 acres by
Sunday night, the federal government's National Interagency Fire
Center reported on its Web site.
</P>
<P>

Florida has been the focus where fires were still burning on
state land in three separate areas: northeast of Gainesville,
north of Tampa and in Sarasota County. No containment dates have
been forecast.

<P>
DHAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday recorded a morale-
boosting seven-wicket win over defending champion Sri Lanka Monday
at the Bangabandhu National Stadium ahead of Wednesday's final of
the seventh Asia Cup Cricket.
</P>
<P>
The last league match of the four-team meet was rather dull,
unlike the other blood-and-thunder clashes featuring tons of runs,
according to The Independent newspaper report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the match, a dress rehearsal of tomorrow's final,
would certainly put Pakistan in a better frame of mind ahead of
the islanders who conceded their first defeat in the four-nation
meet after two successive wins over Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding performance of Yousuf Youhana of Pakistan in
this match earned him the man-of-the-match for the second
successive game.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the Asian Cricket Foundation (ACF)
was launched Monday in Dhaka with pledges to combat financial
crimes from the world of cricket and ensure welfare of regional
cricketers.
</P>
<P>
In its first formal meeting, the foundation, which will work
under the guidance of Asian Cricket Council (ACC), formed an anti-
corruption committee that would be on the alert for financial
crimes and incidents of gross irregularities in the sporting
discipline.
</P>
<P>
The ACF will start functioning after getting approval from the
ACC which is scheduled to meet in London later this month during
the International Cricket Council meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China to turn Fangcheng Port on
northern bank of the Beibu Gulf into the largest container port in
southwest China to cope with the soaring container transportation
industry.
</P>
<P>
The port, an outlet to southeast Asia and countries in other
parts of the world, is one of the 19 major marine hubs of China,
and it has 23 berths and 12 deep-water berths for ships with more
than 100,000 DWC each. Its ships call at 184 ports in 68 countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
With an annual handling capacity of 8.5 million tons, the port
handled 7,000 TEUs in the first quarter of this year, more than
the total of 5,000 TEUs for last year, and it expects to top 20,
000 TEUs this year.
</P>
<P>
Fangcheng is a major port city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region (Province) in southwest China, and the region's annual TEUs
potential may reach 100,000 and that of SW China may reach 200,000
TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guanquan, deputy director of the Port Authority, said
that the port city is seeking domestic and international
cooperation to develop container transportation by linking port
superiority with marine, highway and railway accesses.
</P>
<P>
The Port Authority has reached a letter of intent with the
world's 3rd largest marine shipping company, the Australia-based
PNO Co., to jointly manage container ports and explore new
shipping routes, he added.

nuclear proliferation, he said that to bring the CTBT into full
play, it is indispensable to facilitate the treaty's early entry

This is a common task facing all countries that support the
treaty, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dominance of E-Commerce Expected to End in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dominance of Internet
commerce is expected to end next year as a result of increased
international online buyers and popularity of business-to-business
Web transactions, the International Data Corporation (IDC) said
Monday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. share of worldwide Internet commerce will plunge from
62 percent in 1999 to 48 percent in 2001, according to the report
by the U.S. market researcher.
</P>
<P>
Growth of e-commerce is accelerating worldwide, IDC said,
predicting that by the end of this year, 29 percent of people who
go online will purchase a good or service. That percentage will
swell to 38 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Not only is the number of Web purchasers growing, so is the
size of the average transaction. According to IDC, all this growth
will translate into 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars being spent on
Internet commerce in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"This increased likelihood to buy will be driven by greater
availability of products, improved buyer confidence in security,
and enhanced local language sites for international buyers," said
the report based on 40,000 interviews in 31 countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another study released Monday by U.S. Internet
marketing research firm Greenfield found that the percentage of
online American consumers is down compared with a year ago. Of the
3,000 interviewees, 78 percent shopped online and 70 percent
bought online in the first quarter of this year, compared with 86
percent and 74 percent, respectively, for the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The primary reason recipients gave for curbing their shopping
habits was shipping, according to Greefield's study. Shoppers do
not want to pay the shipping costs involved with buying online.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, online auctions are growing in popularity in the
United States. The percentage of consumers participating in
auctions grew 4 percentage points from last year, from 40 percent
to 44 percent, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Greenfield also found that "click-and-mortar" operations or
those with online and offline outlets appear to be winning the
battle for consumer confidence. In fact, 43 percent of American
online consumers are more comfortable purchasing from online
retailers that have an offline store nearby.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Four Tamil rebel boats and two Sri
Lankan naval craft Monday sunk in a clash off the country's north-
eastern coast, the Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan navy attacked a cluster of Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) boats off Vettilikerni Monday and sank four of
them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE deployed more boats in the confrontation during which
two naval craft were destroyed.

A search operation was launched to rescue the crew of the two
naval craft.
</P>
<P>
Since government forces suffered reversals in April this year,
the fighting in the peninsula has been fierce both on land and at
sea.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has reportedly warned the government forces to quit
the peninsula but government troops decided to ignore it and has
expressed the determination to hold on to the Jaffna peninsula,
the former Tamil rebels' stronghold, which it lost to the troops
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 17-year-old war for a separate
state for the Tamil community in the country. An estimated 60,000
people have been killed in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> BIMST-EC Energy Meeting Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the committee of
experts and officials relating to an energy sector cooperation
program of the BIMST-EC, a sub-regional economic grouping
comprising Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand, is
being held here to formulate a plan of action, the New Light of
Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the two-day meeting on Monday,
Myanmar Energy Minister Brigadier-General Lun Thi said the BIMST-
EC program is now in its third year of existence during which
sectors for cooperation had been identified.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of laying down action plans that
could be translated into strategies to be pursued and implemented
by all member countries.
</P>
<P>
The two projects for cooperation in the energy sector already
identified by the BIMST-EC are the natural gas resources and the
renewable energy sources, both of which are abundant in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called for intensive exploration and exploitation of the
resources as well as development of the related infrastructure and
long-term sustainable utilization of these resources.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged Myanmar's support for all efforts of the
BIMST-EC to develop the region socially and economically.
</P>
<P>
The BIMST-EC was first formed by four countries -- Bangladesh,
India, Sri Lanka and Thailand -- in June 1997 and was later joined
by Myanmar in August that year.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, Myanmar formed a national committee on
cooperation with BIMST-EC countries in the energy sector.

BELGRADE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- All Yugoslavs and the whole
society should go all out to clear the pollution caused by NATO's
air strikes, Yugoslav Minister of Development, Science and
Environment Nada Sljapic said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking World Environment Day, Sljapic
also called for assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Sljapic recalled that 28 years ago it was at the recommendation
of the Yugoslav delegation that the United States designated June
5 as World Environment Day, but unfortunately, during NATO's 78-
day air strikes last year, Yugoslavia suffered serious
environmental contamination.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that NATO deliberately targeted its strikes at
facilities containing highly toxic chemicals, causing grave
environmental contamination.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of depleted uranium bombs, banned by
international law, were dropped by NATO warplanes, posing serious
hazards to the environment and the people, Sljapic added.

<HEADLINE> China's "Marine Silk Road" Starts 200 Years Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists believe
Persian-style silver basins, ivory, glass bowls and crystal-bead
strings unearthed from a leud tomb dating back to the Warring
States Period (475 BC-221 BC) in south China's Guangzhou City,
suggested China's marine trade with the Middle and West Asia began
much earlier than that through the ancient "Land Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
The "imported commodities" came to China in the third century
Before Christ. However, the ancient "Silk Road" that starts from
Xi'an City in western China was explored some 200 years later in
119 BC, said Chinese historians.
</P>
<P>
Chinese official historical records show that foreign trade
through the "marine silk road", so to speak, to other Asian
countries started as early as the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24
AD).
</P>
<P>
Chen Bojian, a renowned historian, said that business may start
much earlier than what the records say, because most of the sea
trade was done by private businesses rather than officials.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no indication that Guangzhou is the starting
point of the "marine silk road", archeological researches have
come to prove it a distributing center for cargo exports via the
Indian Sea, said Chen who has been devoted to the study for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
"Guangzhou is a de facto departure station of the sea trade,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, boats steaming from Guangdong Province would
sail southwestward along the coastline to load goods or replenish
freshwater at ports in Guangdong Province and the neighboring
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and then depart for the west or
the southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the ancient "Land Silk Road" that virtually non-existed
after the Tang Dynasty (618-907), because of harsh geographic
conditions and political turmoils, the "marine silk road" has been
in use all along, said Chen.

WUHAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Transportation license is issued to

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Governor Named Suspect in Bank Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril
Sabirin was named a suspect in the Bank Bali scandal for allegedly
violating the central bank's prudential principle in its policy to
reimburse interbank loans guaranteed by the government, national
newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But no travel ban has been imposed on Sabirin.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin was named a suspect following interrogation by
prosecutors on Monday afternoon. According to the newspapers,
Sabirin left the Attorney General's Office compound Monday night
after being questioned by prosecutors for almost six hours.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin's status as a suspect was not unexpected as prosecutors
had previously pointed to glaring inconsistencies in his testimony
with those of other witnesses over whether or not he attended a
February 11 1999)meeting at a Jakarta hotel which allegedly led
to the reimbursement of funds from Bank Indonesia to Bank Bali for
defaulted loans.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around Bank Indonesia's reimbursement of
904 billion rupiah (129 million U.S. dollars) in defaulted loans
to other banks. Some 546 billion rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars)
of the money was then paid to PT Era Giat Prima for helping Bank
Bali recoup the money. There is suspicion that a large portion of
the money went to help bankroll then president B.J. Habibie's
renomination bid.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General's Office spokesman Yushar Yahya said Monday
that Sabirin had been named a suspect because he accelerated the
reimbursement of the money to Bank Bali, the clearance of which
some believe was conducted through questionable negotiations
between state officials and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
During a late night media briefing on Monday, representatives
for Sabirin attacked the allegations, accusing the government of
fabricating charges to remove the central bank governor.
</P>
<P>
"The governor confided (in us) that he had several times been
given a choice, both directly by the president and the attorney
general or other parties, to either resign and be appointed an
ambassador or be named a suspect," Bank Indonesia's deputy
director for legal affairs Amir Sjarifuddin was quoted by the
Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid and House of Representatives
Speaker Akbar Tandjung have urged the central bank governor to
quit, pending the corruption investigation. The president
reportedly told Sabirin to resign or risk being named a suspect in
the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
Wahid earlier said that all state officials implicated in cases
under investigation should resign to facilitate the legal process.

<HEADLINE> Syriac Inscriptions Discovered In Mogao Caves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have for the
first time found Syriac inscriptions in the famous Mogao Caves of
Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
They made this discovery when they put in order scriptures
unearthed in the northern zone of the Dunhuang Mogao Caves.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned that Chinese archaeologists launched an
excavation in the northern zone between the 1980s and the 1990s,
and discovered 243 more caves which bring the total number of
Mogao caves to 735 from the former 492.
</P>
<P>
These newly discovered caves are very small in size and without
frescos and sculptured figures. Experts said that these caves were
residences of monks and craftsmen who built the grottos.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also discovered inscriptions of Chinese, ancient
Tibetan language, Tujue language, Hebrew and languages of other
ethnic groups in the northern zone.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the discovery is of great significance in the
study of the Dunhuang history, religion and exchanges between
China and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, popularly known as the Thousand
Buddha Caves, were carved out of the rocks stretching for about 1,
600 meters along the eastern side of the Mingsha Hill, 25 km to
the southeast of the town of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty (618-907) inscription records that the first
Mogao cave was built in the 2nd year of Jian Yuan (366 A.D.) of
the Former Qin Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Experts Reveal Secrets with Long-existing Wooden Pagoda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese scientists and
architects have concluded after field study that perfect
structural design, geological location, ideal climate, and use of
sustainable timber are factors behind the nearly 1,000-year old
the wooden pagoda in Yingxian county of Shanxi Province in north
China.
</P>
<P>
Standing 65.86 meters, the octagonal pagoda is not only the
tallest but also the oldest wooden pagoda in China today. Compared
with the renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, the wooden
pagoda in Yingxian is 115 years older and 11.36 meters taller. The
pagoda was listed as a cultural heritage under first-class State
protection in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"The structure of the wooden pagoda is almost perfect," said Ye
Keming, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "It's hard
to imagine how the craftsmen 1,000 years ago came up with the
complex and faultless design without the aid of computers."
</P>
<P>
"The structure of the pagoda is very similar to some modern
high-rises and it ensures not only sufficient space inside the
pagoda but also adequate stability," said Jiang Huancheng, one of
the designers of the Oriental Pearl TV tower in Shanghai, the
highest building in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the dry and windy weather in Yingxian County helped
protect the pagoda from being attacked by moths and the use of
durable timber also contributed to the long life of the pagoda,
according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
Although it has successfully weathered nearly a thousand years
of climatic changes, the pagoda is now seriously unaligned, mainly
due to the damage done by numerous strong earthquakes and cannon
attacks. The first two stories of the pagoda are leaning
northeastward, and some of its wooden columns and parts are broken
or split.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to start a massive restoration and
salvation project to save the wooden pagoda at all costs.
Preparations for the restoration project including an overall
estimate of the damage and geological exploration of the pagoda's
foundation are already near completion, and are expected to cost
nearly seven million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Israel's UTJ Party to Support Early Election Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's United Torah Judaism
(UTJ) party announced Tuesday that it would support an early
election bill submitted by an opposition legislator.
</P>
<P>
All of UTJ's five members of the Knesset (Parliament) would vote
in favor of the bill, if it comes up for voting in the Knesset on
Wednesday, the party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
largest coalition partner, also threatened on Tuesday to topple the
government by voting in favor of the bill which asks for dissolving
the parliament and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
The bill was prepared by opposition legislator Avigdor
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
Shas Knesset member Yair Perez said Tuesday that he has been
asked to mobilize the party's legislators to vote in favor of the
bill, which is expected to come up in the Knesset for a preliminary
reading on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shas Chairman Eli Yishai, who returned home Tuesday evening from
Geneva, said that all its 17 Knesset members would vote in favor of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
Up to now it is not certain whether Lieberman will ask the
Knesset to vote his bill, and local political analysts said that
Lieberman would withdraw his bill if it is not guaranteed a
majority of 61 votes in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Barak and the Shas leadership took a rapid turn
for the worse on Monday. Responding to a Shas threat to vote for
the bill if Shas' demands for more funding to its ailing
educational system are not met, Barak called off government
negotiations with Shas over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shas has 17 seats in the Knesset. Its defection would upset the
68-52 majority of Barak's coalition, already weakened by the
National Religious Party which disagrees with Barak's peace
policies.
</P>
<P>
Barak declared that he is not prepared to conduct negotiations
that are accompanied by Shas' threats, even if the threats are
implicit.
</P>
<P>
Shas' educational system is deeply indebted due to its poor
management over the past few years. Education Minister Yossi Sarid
refused to allocate more funds until Shas improves its management
and fires corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Shas wants Barak to order Sarid to transfer millions of shekels
to its cash-strapped school system. And this dispute has been
dragging on for months without a proper settlement.
</P>
<P>
Shas' spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, who has a final say
over all party issues, has nevertheless not instructed the party's
lawmakers how to vote.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia will increase annual oil
production to 340 million tons by 2015, Russian Deputy Fuel and
Energy Minister Valery Garipov told journalists Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's oil production will grow 7 million tons to 310-312
million tons in 2000, and within 15 years 70 percent of national
oil will be produced in Western Siberia, compared to the current
68 percent, Garipov announced at a national seminar on the
development of Russian oil deposits, in the city of Almetevsk.
</P>
<P>
The oil output will rise thanks to the development of new
deposits, the renewal of operations at idle wells and the
introduction of new production technology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seminar, Tatarstan presidential aide Rinat
Muslimov predicted that the republic will provide the country with
over 27 million tons of oil this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Muslimov, about 23 million tons of this will be
produced by Tatarstan's largest oil enterprise Tatneft and over 4
million tons by 27 small oil companies in the republic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries to Create Best Environment for Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Tuesday that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have reached a
critical moment for resolving difficult issues and making
difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We're down now to the difficult issues and to the difficult
decisions," he told reporters at the White House ahead of his
talks with Jordan's King Abdullah. He promised to "create the best
possible environment" for the Israelis and Palestinians to work
out a framework for a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, now in the Middle East
to try to revive Mideast peace talks both on Israeli-Palestinian
track and on Israeli-Syrian track, announced on Tuesday that
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will hold peace talks near
Washington next week and Clinton said he was "encouraged" by
Albright's mission in the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last week,
will also meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on June 14 in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether he planned a Camp David-style session,
Clinton said he would await Albright's return, but first he would
have "a lot to discuss" with King Abdullah on the Mideast peace
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"His Majesty and I are going to talk today. So after that, we'
ll make some decisions about what to do next," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said both Israel and the Palestinians should be
prepared to compromise before they could reach some agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I've been told by an old friend of mine that the best solution
is one that both sides are a bit unhappy about, which means that
both sides have had to give up something," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And I think that when we look at final status, both sides have
to be very open-minded about the other people's position," he
added.

The Council demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and
reiterated its call for the demilitarization of the area as agreed
to by both governments, it said in a press statement after hearing
a briefing on the DRC by U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping He di Annabi.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council believe that armed engagements
between the two foreign armies of Rwanda and Uganda on the
territory of the DRC in violation of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of this country are incompatible with the
Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and unacceptable," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission to the DRC reported that fighting broke out in
Kisangani Monday and continued Tuesday with four people, including
two U.N. staffers, injured by glass splinters and falling debris.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts by the neutral facilitator, former President
Ketumile Masire of Botswana, to carry out his mandate regarding
the inter-Congolese dialogue have run into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The DRC Government has refused to take part in the preparatory
committee convened by Masier in Contonou, Benin, Monday and
Tuesday, and representatives of civil society and political
parties from the DRC have not been allowed to leave the country to
participate in the meeting, according to Annabi.

<HEADLINE> Burundian President to Visit S. Africa to Promote Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya will visit South Africa on Wednesday, which is believed to
be just another step towards restoring peace in his country, an
expert said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"His discussion with mediator Nelson Mandela will be one of the
many more to come," said Hannelie de Beer who is working at the
Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
She said one could safely assume that Buyoya and his Defense
Minister Cyrille Ndayirukiye will come to Johannesburg to learn
from South Africa's experience in military integration.
</P>
<P>
The talks come ahead of a planned visit by Mandela to Burundi
later this month to meet armed groups and people in the country's
controversial regroupment camps.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's office Monday disclosed that the former South African
 president's visit to Bujumbura would last three days beginning
from June 12.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who was appointed chief facilitator late last year,
said last week that he would urge the Burundian government to lift
restrictions it had imposed on the political opposition and
members of the media.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mandela held separate closed-door discussions with
Burundian government representatives and rebel groups to secure
support for his peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Central to Mandela's plan was a 15-point document for peace
based on proposals from delegations to earlier rounds of peace
talks in the northern town of Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is aiming for a final round of negotiations in July
which he hopes will result in a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
de Beer, an expert in African conflicts, predicted that efforts
to peacefully resolve the conflict between Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi-dominated government would be a drawn-out process.
</P>
<P>
"It will take time for the warring parties to learn to trust
each other," she said.
</P>
<P>
War broke out in the tiny central African country in 1993,
pitting several rebel Hutu factions against the Tutsi-dominated
government and army.
</P>
<P>
Hutus, mostly peasant farmers, represent 85 percent of Burundi's
 population.
</P>
<P>
Mandela last week rejected the rebels' demand that their forces
should constitute 70 percent of the army.
</P>
<P>
It would be best if the country's army is 50 percent Hutu and
50 percent Tutsi, with representation for other minorities, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops to Leave Congo if Security Ensured: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has declared that the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will
leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) once Uganda's
legitimate security concerns are met within a regionally and
internationally recognized framework.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Tuesday afternoon when
delivering the State of the Nation Address at the International
Conference Center here during the opening of the fifth session of
the Sixth Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the way forward for the DRC lies in the
implementation of the Lusaka peace agreement which was signed by
all belligerents in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
A UPDF vehicle was attacked in the Kisangani city of the DRC
Monday morning. Later the UPDF and the Rwandan Patriotic Army
(RPA) were involved in skirmishes which still continued Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Museveni, the skirmishes were started by the RPA
who fired on and completely destroyed the UPDF vehicle on its way
back from Bangoka airport to a UPDF base across the town.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observers were this time able to see for themselves
that the trouble was started by the RPA, the president said,
adding that the RPA's provocation forced the UPDF to move and put
a front at Tchopo bridge following which the RPA launched 12
attacks on the UPDF.
</P>
<P>
Both Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in Kisangani
where they back rival rebel factions fighting against President of
the DRC Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Protests Over Petrol Price Hike in Nigeria Spread to Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Protests over a 50 percent petrol
price rise in Nigeria, the largest oil-producing country in
Africa, entered the second day on Tuesday and spread to the
country's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from the capital, protesting
workers in the capital blocked the main access road to the
presidential villa and barred government workers from entering
their offices.
</P>
<P>
The protesters demanded an immediate reversal of the prices and
vowed to resist any hike.
</P>
<P>
The protests began on Monday across southwestern Nigeria ahead
of a planned strike by the Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) on
Thursday over the hike.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gas stations in Lagos remained shut on Tuesday and
car petrol peddlers seem to be having their good time on the
streets of the largest city in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government last Thursday increased the country's
petrol price by 50 percent to 30 naira (100 naira equals about one
U. S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision had met with mixed reactions in the country.
People in the business sector generally welcomed the move despite
the costs added to their operation, saying it is inevitable to
reduce the huge amount of money spent on subsidizing for a low
petrol price.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Information Minister Jerry Gana Monday said the hike
was caused by the country's heavy reliance upon foreign petrol
imports and mismanagement of its own petrol refineries.
</P>
<P>
The hike was justified by the billions of naira to be saved,
which could be used to reduce poverty and achieve universal
education, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)Moldovan Economy Is Growing this Year, Prime Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The industrial output in Republic
Moldova has grown up by 35.8 percent from the beginning of this
year, compared with the same period last year, Prime Minister
Dumitru Braghis stated on Tuesday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"In comparable prices, the growth figure in the national
economy as a whole was 3.9 percent", he said, adding "these are
very good indicators for Moldova which must be necessarily
consolidated".
</P>
<P>
Asked about external debt repaying, the Prime Minister stated
that heretofore his Cabinet has not been late with even a single
external payment. "This year, we cannot count on putting off our
due payments to international financial institutions", Braghis
added.
</P>
<P>
"There exist no real hope to expect this. The situation can
only be relieved by borrowing new credits for redeeming new ones",
said the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
He told the media that the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank are ready to continue cooperation with Moldova.
Presently, the Government is drafting a new Memorandum of
cooperation with these institutions.
</P>
<P>
In July, an IMF mission is expected to arrive in Chisinau to
negotiate a new program -- to fight poverty. According to this
program, Moldova will be able to receive new IMF loans for longer
periods and at lower interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Italy Favors Putin's Proposal on Joint Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy favors the idea advanced by
Russian President Vladimir Putin here Monday of developing an anti-
missile system with European countries and NATO, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"We can only look with favor" on the proposal, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual gala evening of the Italo-American
Association NIAF, Dini remarked that Putin already proposed
developing an anti-missile system with the United States, in talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that, when he came to Rome, he thought of extending
this proposal to NATO and therefore to European countries, can
only be viewed favorably," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Putin on Monday proposed a joint anti-missile shield with the
European Union and NATO in response to United States insistence on
pushing ahead with its own anti- missile system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposal would avoid upsetting the balance of
forces, while also giving all European countries a "100%
guarantee" of security with the support of their American partner.
</P>
<P>
In the Russia-U.S. summit in Moscow at the last weekend, Putin
refused to accept the amendment of the anti- ballistic missile
treaty which Clinton needs to go ahead with the planned U.S. anti-
missile shield.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help Train New Army Recruits in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua)-- Britain said on Tuesday that it will
help to train new army recruits in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the House of Commons, Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said the security situation in Sierra Leone
was much improved, in part because of the British military
presence.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain would provide a short term training team to
help train the Sierra Leone army's new recruits, adding that the
training would be conducted by around 180 personnel from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary also announced that Britain's general
military withdrawal remained on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of British military forces would be withdrawn on
schedule by the middle of this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also insisted that Britain would continue to provide
valuable back-up to the United Nations operation, including better
communications and military advice for its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Cook also revealed that he is to visit Sierra
Leone for a meeting on Thursday with President Ahmad Tejan Kabba
to discuss what else the United Kingdom could do to help.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain was the "lead nation" in training a new Sierra
Leone army.
</P>
<P>
"We propose to accelerate our training in order to achieve a
rapid boost in troop capacity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Government Tries to Avoid New Rise in Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan government decided
to issue for free 1,800 tons of wheat flour from the state reserve
to the country's largest bakery Franzeluta, in a bid to avoid a
new rise in prices, the Prime Minister Dumitru Braghis told a
press conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the "bread crisis" is overcome definitively, Franzeluta
will have to return the flour, the Prime Minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Braghis is confident that the prices of bakery products will
not grow more expensive in June as there is no reasons to raise
the prices again. According to him, the recent bread crisis had
been unleashed artificially by bakeries and certain business
people in order to push up the prices.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this week, the government will gather all main
bread producers to try and resolve the problem of price formation.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see any reasons for such a pushing up of prices till
the next harvest", stressed Braghis.

<HEADLINE> Motion Against Iraq Embargo Passed in Italian Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Senate Tuesday night
overwhelmingly passed a motion calling on the government to work
towards getting the embargo on Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the government, Undersecretary for foreign affairs
Ugo Intini said Italy had been working for some time alongside
other European countries to ease the embargo.
</P>
<P>
But he added that proponents of lifting the ban should also
consider the fact that Saddam Hussein had flatly rejected all
proposals for easing the ban, insisting that it be lifted totally
and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The motion calls on the government to take all initiatives to
revoke the embargo, strengthen Italy's diplomatic presence in
Baghdad and open new and more direct channels for bilateral
humanitarian aid, especially food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Another of the goals set down is re-opening the Italian embassy
in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Senate whip for the largest party in the house, Cesare
Salvi of the Left Democrats, said the motion meant Italy could "
place itself in the vanguard for the defense of human rights...
responding to the cries for help from the children and old people
of Iraq."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Found Hard to Keep IT Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen percent of the U.S.
workforce is continually in transition between jobs, which creates
an intensely competitive labor market, pushing up the cost of
staffing and retention, a U.S. market researcher said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The situation is especially true in information technology (IT).
International Data Corporation said in a report released Tuesday
that attrition is the single largest contributor to the IT skills
and staffing shortage in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Companies in the 21st century not only have to deal with a
momentous lack of skilled IT workers," said the report, "they also
have to learn how to manage a significantly changing workforce.
The way work will be accomplished this millennium will be very
different than in the past because of a very different workforce."
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the report said, individual interests have replaced
trust and loyalty as the primary reasons for employees'
association with companies. According to IDC, downsizing, resizing,
rightsizing and reengeneering employee jobs for the sake of
improving the bottom line contributed to eroding employee trust
and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
"The available workers in the 21st century will expect and
demand individual accommodation with regard to their needs for
security, predictability, and dignity," said the report. "The
balance of power will shift entirely from the employer to the
employee in the United States."
</P>
<P>
Within IT, e-commerce is perhaps the hottest jobs. According to
a recent report by the Information Technology Association of
America, Web-related skills are now required for 13 percent of the
country's 10 million IT jobs.
</P>
<P>
The same is true in many other countries. As companies around
the globe scramble to establish their presence online, they are
desperate for Web and e-commerce developers, Internet security
professionals and project managers.
</P>
<P>
IDC's recommendations for attracting IT talent include
transferring organizational power to the employees and sharing
profits. IDC also suggests companies and employees take extra time
to make sure the employee and company fit well together during the
hiring process to reduce attrition.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says Russia Will Eventually Allow NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gore, a Democratic candidate for the presidential election,
told reporters the U.S. is just seeking "some small modifications"
to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton failed to persuade the Russian
government to agree to modify the treaty during his trip to Moscow
last week. Gore said the administration is not discouraged by the
failure.
</P>
<P>
"I think eventually they will change. There's a difference
between ripping it up and throwing it away and making some small
modifications to it," Gore added.
</P>
<P>
However, Gore admitted that American officials recognize that
it is going to take some time to convince the Russians that
America's defense plans are no threat to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Moscow fears that the deployment of NMD system will undermine
the international arms control architecture and the world security
order. Washington argues that its plan only targets the threat
from the "rogue states."
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Washington agreed that there exists the missile
attack threats when Clinton met Russian President Vladimir Putin
last week.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that they're acknowledging and recognizing
the problems they could face in the future ... similar to the ones
we recognize and are preparing for," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaking on the ABC's "Good Morning America" on
Monday, Gore said he would consider scraping the ABM treaty and do
whatever was needed to ensure the safety of all Americans if he
was elected president.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls For Ban on Sierra Leone's Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday called for a ban
on the export of diamonds from rebel-held areas of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons that
Britain is pressing for an international trade embargo on diamonds
from Sierra Leone, a former British colony.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade in diamonds in Sierra Leone is fueling the
civil war in that Western African nation.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that Britain was exploring with its partners at the
United Nations Security Council a resolution banning the trade in
diamonds from Sierra Leone except where they are certified as
legitimate by the country's government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the parliament, the foreign secretary
revealed that he is to visit Sierra Leone for a meeting on
Thursday with President Ahmad Tejan Kabba to discuss what else the
United Kingdom could do to help.
</P>
<P>
Cook said diamonds had fueled the rebellion for the past nine
years.
</P>
<P>
The people of the country were among the poorest in the world
yet the rebels could purchase vast quantities of arms, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ultimate objective was for the government of
Sierra Leone to take control of the diamond-mining areas, but that
in the short term the trade in illicit stones needed bringing
under control.
</P>
<P>
Britain will push for a diamond trade code of conduct at a July
meeting in Japan of foreign ministers from the Group of Eight (G-8)
leading industrial nations in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 Group consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan the United States and Russia. The group is scheduled
to hold a summit in Japan next month.
