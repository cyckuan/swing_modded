<HEADLINE> Blair Unveils Plans to Modernize NHS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Thursday pledged to provide the National Health Service with the
resources it needs to modernize for the future.
</P>
<P>
Announcing a "crusade for excellence" at the NHS
Confederation's 50th anniversary meeting, Blair said the
government is to set up a modernization fund for the NHS in a bid
to tie extra funding to progress on waiting times and
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
Health economists say the NHS needs an extra eight billion
pounds (13.3 billion U.S. dollars) over the next three years just
to maintain its earlier rate of growth, which has been driven by
advances in medical technology.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he could not reveal the size of this 50th birthday
present just yet, but promised the NHS would get the resources it
needed.
</P>
<P>
"I want a health service with the confidence that its funding
will allow it to plan ahead, to be creative, to develop services,
in the knowledge that they will be there not just today but in the
years ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new cash will be used to buy new technology, reduce waiting
lists, and pay for better training of staff.

<HEADLINE> Indian Bank Piles Losses of 510 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian Bank Chairman S. Rajagopal
said Thursday that the scam-hit bank has already run up losses of
20 billion rupees (510 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the bank might find it impossible to wipe out these
losses for at least eight years without another round of bail-out
by the government in the form of write-off of recapitalized funds.
</P>
<P>
Claiming the higher non-performing assets level in 1997-98 was
due to the poor economic conditions and the tight money situation,
the bank chairman said the losses would have been less but for the
impact of a reduction in income and an increase in operating
expenses.
</P>
<P>
He announced plans to set up an asset reconstruction company to
take over its bad debts.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Forced to Flee Homes by Florida Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 35,000 people fled
their homes in Florida, where wildfires regained their flames that
destroyed dozens of homes and buildings overnight.
</P>
<P>
Wind up to 30 kph throughout the day and high temperatures
above 38 degrees Celsius could drive the blazes even higher on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brevard County Fire officials said that firefighters did not
have enough equipment to keep the blazes away from homes.
</P>
<P>
In Volusia, at least 10 homes and 20 business were destroyed
and in Brevard, about 50 homes were destroyed along with many
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Since late May, more than 1,700 fires have burned more than
101,000 hectares. In an average year, Florida fires burn 45,300
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The wildfires, which damaged or destroyed at least 86 homes,
have lasted much longer and threatened a far wider area than the
fires of Summer 1985, which destroyed 200 homes in the Palm Coast
area.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 people were told to leave their homes in Volusia
County, mostly from Ormond Beach and the northwest section of
Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents who had moved out earlier were staying in
shelters while many kept all-night vigils outside barricaded
neighborhoods, gathering in groups with belongings as smoke and
falling ash surrounded them.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred firefighters were battling that blaze, using
bulldozers to plow firelines and helicopters to dump water on the
flames.

<P>
-- Russian miners from across the nation have camped in Moscow
to protest the failure of the government to pay their salaries
over the past nine months. Sitting under big plastic sacks
installed before the White House, which is the seat of the
Russian administration, the minors also asked for the resignation
of President Boris Yeltsin and refused to descend into the mines
whose security conditions fall far short of the European norms.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, Nigeria's Nobel Prize for
Liberature laureate Wole Soyinka asked the European Union to
maintain its sanctions against Nigeria, because he said the new
government is not cut from the regime of General Sani Abacha, who
died last month.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The CAC 40 stock index of the Paris Bourse has risen by 42
percent over the past six months. Some 14 billion francs (2.3

past six months in the Paris Bourse, as is compared with 9.5 billion
francs (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Tax Evasion Serious in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Malawi only collected 3.6 billion
Kwacha (144 million Dollars) income tax in 1997/98 fiscal year as
against the targeted 3.8 billion Kwacha#,mainly due to tax
evasion, a Malawian tax official said.
</P>
<P>
Massive tax evasion and non-compliance are currently
frustrating efforts by Malawi's Income Tax Department to collect
income tax from individuals and companies to meet target,
Malawian Commissioner of Taxes, Clement Mononga, said at a press
briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Malawi News Agnecy quoted Mononga as saying: "We can't
give actual figures...but some people have registered businesses
for instance, minibus operarions, but are operating from their
homes, hence making it difficult for us to track them down."
</P>
<P>
In the 1996/97 period, only 3.5 billion Kwacha (140 millon
Dollars) was collected which was still lower than the target.
</P>
<P>
Mononga admitted that some individuals and businesses were
not paying tax out of ignorance but "others are deliberately
ignoring the department reminders and notices."
</P>
<P>
He accused some employers of deliberately not remitting tax
money deducted from their workers' wages and salaries.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed his department's underperformance to
understaffing and limited resources.
</P>
<P>
The government recently stopped departments and ministries
from recruiting staff in a bid to cut over-expenditure, which has
made many departments and ministries work on skeleton staff.

<HEADLINE> EU to Sue France on Drinking Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
its decision on Thursday to take legal action against France for
failure to combat pollution of surface water used for drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, will make an application to the European Court of Justice
against France.
</P>
<P>
The commission claimed that the untreated water of the rivers
used for abstraction of drinking water in Brittany, France, has
consistently registered nitrate levels of more than 50 milligrams
per litre of water.
</P>
<P>
The mandatory limit value of nitrates is 50 milligrams per
litre as set by the European council of ministers in the
Community's Surface Water Directive. The suggested limit value is
below 25 milligrams per litre.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials explained that the objective of the
community directive is to establish a minimum quality standard for
those untreated waters intended for the abstraction of drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
In Brittany, 80 percent of drinking water is taken from rivers
and reservoirs but in the last national survey for the period
between 1993 and 1995, 49 catchments in France exceeded the
community directive limit.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three of these catchments were located in Brittany, as a
result of intensive agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Goes Up to 4.5 Pct in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crisis and
the General Motors strike slowed U.S. job growth in June, causing
the unemployment rate up to 4.5 percent from a 28-year-low during
the two previous months, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
still remained below the 5 percent rate of a year ago, according
to the department.
</P>
<P>
Employers created a moderate 205,000 jobs to their payrolls in
June, compared with 309,000 in May. Most of the gains came in
services. Manufacturers cut 29,000 jobs, the fourth decline in
five months and the worst since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
This reflected drops in industries either facing strong
competition from Asian imports or loss of export sales to Asia,
including apparel, textiles, paper products and electronic
components.
</P>
<P>
Payrolls fell by 6,000 in the auto industry, reflecting the
June 5 strike at GM's stamping plant in Flint, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report today, the department said the
number of first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged
last week because of the GM strike. They jumped by 24,000 to a
seasonally adjusted 390,000, the highest level since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
That followed increases of 35,000 the previous week and 17,000
two weeks earlier. The department said the bulk of the latest
increase came in three states, Michigan, Ohio and New York, and
officials there attributed most to the strike.
</P>
<P>
But Service industries continued to take strong job gains.
Temporary-help firms added 32,000 and engineering and management
services increased by 25,000. Meanwhile, employment in finance,
insurance and real estate grew by 30,000 over the month. Over the
past year, the industry group has grown about 50 percent faster
than the rest of the economy, adding a quarter of a million jobs.
</P>
<P>
Computer-related and health services also showed large
improvement. Retailers added 53,000 jobs, nearly half of them at
restaurants and bars. Construction jobs increased by 20,000,
helped by a housing boom spurred by low interest rates related to
the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> New Transit Route for Nepal to Boost Trade: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The recent agreement by India to
open the Phulbari transit route leading to Bangladesh for all the
days of the week will boost Nepal's trade with Bangladesh and
other countries, the Nepali Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Nepal in late May, Indian President K.R.
Narayanan formally announced that Nepal could use the transit
route for seven days a week, the ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Nepal received an official notification to that effect from the
Indian side on June 23, it said.
</P>
<P>
The transit route, which land-locked Nepal had been seeking as
an alternative to the Calcutta port in India since 1978, gives
Nepal an access to the Mongla port in Bangladesh through Phulbari
in northeastern India.
</P>
<P>
The route went into operation on September 1, 1997 on a
six-month trial basis, but had remained idle for most of the time
due to impractical operating modalities.
</P>
<P>
The business community in Nepal said the poor use was due to
the fact India allowed the route to be used only on Saturdays and
Sundays, as well as other obstacles like poor infrastructure in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In early March, India agreed to extend Nepal's use of the route
and agreed later that month to open it for four days a week after
commerce secretaries of the two countries met in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
When visiting Nepal in mid-March, Bangladeshi Finance Minister
Shah Kibria said his country was working to upgrade the physical
infrastructure to make the transit route economically viable in
the near future to boost trade between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Advises Angolans in Namibia Not to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is advising the Angolans in
Nambia not to return home following reports of renewed clashes
between warring factions in their country.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association Wednesday quoted UNHCR
assistant program officer Martha Mutilifa as saying that "due to
political unrest in Angola, the UNHCR feels that this is not the
right time to encourage voluntary repatriation".
</P>
<P>
In April, the UN agency launched a campaign to encourage
Angolans at Osire Refugee Camp of Namibia to return home as part
of a voluntary repatriation program.
</P>
<P>
However, fighting broke out at the weekend in Angola's Cuando
Cubango Province, which borders Nambia's Okavango region.
</P>
<P>
Mutilifa confirmed that asylum seekers were entering Nambia on
a daily basis from Angola, Congo, Burundi and Rwanda. Most of
them were Angolans. There were at Osire Camp 2186 refugees, and
2063 of them were Angolans, she said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Broadcasting Corporation Television Wednesday quoted
the Angolan Ambassador to Namibia Garcia Bires as saying that the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had taken
over two former UN bases in southeastern Angola and was expected
to take Calai soon.
</P>
<P>
A small number of government troops and UN peacekeepers have
fled into Namibia since the renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, new UN Security Council sanctions went into
force against the UNITA and its leader Jonas Savimbi for not
keeping to the Lusaka Peace Protocols, signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The protocols provide for a UN-supervised peace settlement
between the Angolan government and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include travel curbs and an oil and arms
embargo. The bank accounts of UNITA's leaders and their families
are frozen and the group may not trade in diamonds.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Arafat's Criticism Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu rejected Thursday the condemnation issued by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat of Israel's plan to expand the boundaries of
the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting here with visiting Canadian
Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion, Netanyahu urged
Arafat to stop what he called "incitement" on the Jerusalem which
threatens the security of Jews living in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel can not accept the incitement and will
take measures to confront any actions that the Palestinians might
take in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's statement was in response to Arafat's speech
Wednesday that called on the Palestinian people to fight
Israel's Jerusalem expansion plan and protect the territorial
integrity of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Palestinian Legislative Council in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, Arafat declared the battle for Jerusalem as
"one of life and death" and vowed that the Palestinians will not
surrender in the fight to get the city back to their hands.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no peace, no security and no stability in
Jerusalem without it being returned to the Palestinians," Arafat
told the session, which was also attended by members of the
Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
This was Arafat's sharpest reaction to Israeli Cabinet's
decision on June 21 to expand Jerusalem's boundaries to not only
incorporate some Jewish suburbs but also eight Jewish settlements
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, a city that is holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians,
is one of the most sensitive dispute in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process. Israel took over the traditionally Arab East
Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War and late annexed it in 1980.
</P>
<P>
While Israel has declared the whole city as its eternal and
indivisible capital, the Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be
the capital of a future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Jerusalem's status should be settled
through the permanent talks between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> C'Wealth Optimistic About Abiola's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaoku said here Thursday afternoon Nigeria's
most prominent opposition leader Moshood Abiola and other
political detainees will gain freedom soon.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic that before too long, Chief Abiola and
all the other political detainees will be released," Anyaoku said
at a press conference at the end of his four-day visit to the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku's words confirmed reports which quoted his United

Abuja that the Nigerian government has promised
to release all political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the presumed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential elections, is among the more than 200 political
prisoners and detainees across the country.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku, who is to leave for London later Thursday, said the
Commonwealth has long been asking for the release of Abiola and
part of his visit to Nigeria is to explore the possibility
for that to happen.

<P>
The Commonwealth chief disclosed that he had talked about that
question with both Abiola and the head of state, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the imminent release of Abiola and other
political detainees came after these meetings.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has being suffering sanctions imposed by the
Commonwealth and other western countries for its alleged poor
human right situation and military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
Since the sudden death of former military ruler General Sani
Abacha early June, the west has seen and been encouraged by
what Anyaoku called "positive developments" taking place in the
country.
</P>
<P>
These developments, characterized by the release of some 30
political detainees and the government's wide consultation for
national reconciliation, are expected to bring Nigeria back to
democracy, according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
The release of Abiola is regarded as a key step toward true
national reconciliation.

"The Task Force recommends that the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Center for Human
Settlements (HABITAT) examine, together with representatives of
business, industry and other economic interests, ways of involving
that community constructively in their deliberations." according
to the Task Force report.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation is made in view of the fact that
environment and human settlements policy must be more integrated
with economic decision-making. "This means that there must be a
well-balanced and effective continuing dialogue with business,
industry and other economic interests," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The report also called for developing the Earthwatch system
for assessing the condition of the global environment.
Monitoring and assessment are closely linked to predicting
possible environmental emergencies which could threaten
security.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force recommended that UNEP and HABITAT maximize
their ability to provide early warning of possible environmental
and human settlement emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force designed its recommendations to address the
problems of institutional fragmentation and the lack of policy
coherence which were hampering the work of the United Nations in
the area of the environment and human settlements.
</P>
<P>
It called for the establishment of an inter-agency environment
management group to take a problem-solving, results-oriented
approach to joint action.
</P>

The Task Force emphasized the importance of strengthening the
United Nations presence in Nairobi, and stressed the need to
make the status of the United Nations office there commensurate
with other major U.N. centers, such as those at Vienna and Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Moves to Normalize Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has expressed readiness to
increase trade and economic cooperation with Syria in an effort to
normalize the bilateral relations severed in 1980, informed
sources said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi overture was made to Syrian officials by Iraqi Trade
Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, who is on a visit here to discuss
ways of promoting bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade,
industry and health.
</P>
<P>
Iraq agreed to grant Syrian goods preferential treatment and
facilitate the launching of trade ventures and cooperation among
businessmen of the two countries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh has held talks with Syrian Health Minister Mohammed Iyad
Shatti, Minister of Economy and Trade Mohammed al-Imadi and
Chairman of the Syrian Chamber of Commerce Rateb Al-Shallah.
</P>
<P>
Saleh's visit is viewed as part of Iraq's efforts to normalize
its relations with Syria, which were severed in 1980 due to
Syria's support for Iran in the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have probed the possibility for Iraq to import
goods via Syria's Mediterranean ports and resume export of oil
through Syrian pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program signed between Iraq and the
United Nations in 1996, Syria's pharmaceutical firms have taken
part in 12 tenders offered by Iraq to buy medicine. Syria was
awarded contracts worth 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program, an exception of U.N. economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, allows Iraq to sell a
limited amount of oil to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Syria so far has signed with Iraq 20 million dollars worth of
contracts on exporting goods to Iraq.

PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Thursday discussed the situation in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo with visiting U.S. special envoy for former Yugoslavia
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said

</P>
<P>
They agreed that the two countries will maintain close contact
in the coming days over the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine and Holbrooke also discussed the possible military
options by NATO in the Yugoslav province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Official Calls for Promoting ASEM Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
Thursday called for further strengthening of the ASEM (Asia-Europe
Meeting) process to promote cooperation between the two continents
and help Asia out of its present economic woes.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made at a dinner here in honor of the members of
the 2nd ASEM Vision Group Meeting, Singapore Minister for Law and
Foreign Affairs S. Jayakumar said the group has an important role
to play in the ASEM process and its recommendations will help
decide whether the ASEM process retains its momentum or lose its
direction.
</P>
<P>
The Vision Group, which was launched at the Second ASEM Summit
in London in April 1998, consists of members respectively
appointed by the 25 ASEM member countries and the European
Commission. It has been entrusted to formulate medium- to
long-term visions for enhanced Asia-Europe cooperation with
specific and "actionable" recommendations for the ASEM leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to come up with new and bold initiatives
which government officials dealing with ASEM may hesitate to
propose, ideals which will have to be both practical and
pragmatic," Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
"Not being directly involved in ASEM's organization or
activities, the Vision Group will be able to objectively evaluate
ASEM's record and to recommend both medium and long-term
strategies for ASEM's future development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the situation in Asia, Jayakumar said: "The Asia
today bears little resemblance to the Asia that hosted ASEM I (in
1996)," adding that Asia has been in the grip of a severe economic
and financial crisis and Asia's economic woes will persist for the
short to medium term.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the cooperation between Asia and Europe during the
period between the first and second ASEM summits, the minister
said: "There were concerns that a Europe which is preoccupied with
its own integration and the onset of the Euro, will simply turn
its back on Asia at its time of need."
</P>
<P>
"Others questioned Europe's commitment to helping Asia manage
and overcome its problems," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the second ASEM summit, Europe demonstrated its continued
commitment to Asia by expressing its confidence and willingness to
help Asia deal with the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM Vision Group is on a two-day meeting here and has
formed three working groups to facilitate in-depth discussions on
three major areas of cooperation: "Man &AMP; Society", "Global Market"
and "Governance."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Meets Trade Union Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Thursday Held talks with leaders of the Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Union (ZCTU) on issues affecting workers and the
macro-economic situation.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the ZCTU held two nationwide strikes,
protesting high prices and demanding the government to remove the
2.5 percent sales tax.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, President of the ZCTU, Gibson Sibanda
told a press conference that their meeting with Mugabe has been
a ''major break through".
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said that the president, after listening to ZCTU's
grievances, sympathised with the workers' plight.
</P>
<P>
He said that they had a positive exchange of views with
Mugabe. This is an indication the government will listen to
workers' concerns, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU presented Mugabe with a position paper outlining the
workers demands which included the need for the government to
ensure the cost of basic goods will not continue to escalate.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is facing an economic crisis triggered by the crash
of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major currencies last year which
led to nationwide job stayaways.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said, ''The dialogue that we opened today was long
overdue. These stayaways could have been avoided.''
</P>
<P>
He said that the ZCTU will consider what it will now do after
receiving government's response in two weeks. "We are confident
positive things will come out of these meetings," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister for Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare, Florence Chitauro, Mugabe will table the ZCTU paper for
cabinet discussion next Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Calls for Fighting Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday urged the Islamic world to fight against extremist
activities.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic countries should decisively face up to anyone
threatening the future of the Islamic nation and impede its
march," Mubarak told the opening ceremony of the tenth conference
of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
In an address read out by Egyptian Minister of Religious
Endowment Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzouq, Mubarak stressed the urgent need
for confronting violence and terrorism inspired by extremists.
</P>
<P>
"These acts drain the potentials of the nation and divert it
from facing up to plots concocted by its enemies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 ministers of religious endowments and more than 1,000
delegates from 75 Islamic countries attended the four-day
conference aimed at forging a strategy to solidify the Islamic
society and brace up for challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Should the Islamic world lag behind the modern age, it will be
left in backwardness and consigned to oblivion," he warned, adding
that Islamic home must be reorganized from within.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president stressed that real strength does not
rest on armaments, but the power of science, planning and the
possession of the most advanced inventions.
</P>
<P>
"The divided Islamic world of today undermines its own
capabilities and determination and paralyzes its activities, at a
time other blocs group themselves into one strong bloc," Mubarak
said, citing the European Union as a good example.
</P>
<P>
"It is a must for the Islamic world to strictly eliminate
everything that stands on the road of its modernization and to
challenge the terrorism and violence schemed by the radical
enemies of Islam," he added.

MAPUTO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Election
Committee (NEC) announced that the local elections held on June
30 in the country's 33 towns and cities were "peaceful".
</P>
<P>
The NEC statement said that though some separate incidents
happened, the elections proceeded peacefully " with no violence
and unrest", the Mozambican News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the polling stations started receiving voters at six
in the morning, though there were some delays for one reason or
another, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But About 80 percent of voters did not turn up to cast their
votes in some areas.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Resistance Movement (Renamo) Chairman
Afonso Dhlakama said that he was satisfied with the low turn-out
for the elections, saying it is a result of the boycott of the
elections by the Renamo and 11 other parties.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama also called the president of the country to annul the
elections.
</P>
<P>
But NEC Chairman Leonardo Simbine said the right whether to
declare the election effective or not, is up for the Supreme
Court to decide.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the 33 towns and cities, with 1.9 million
voters, are expected to have their new mayors in 14 days.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses Syria of Supporting Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Following an attack on Israeli
troops in south Lebanon Thursday, Israel renewed its accusation
against Syria for supporting the anti-Israel Hezbollah guerrilla
forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon as
saying that Syria is behind the attacks carried out by the Shiite
Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, the leading hawk within the Israeli government, accused
Damascus of using Hezbollah as a bargain chip to obtain political
concessions from Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the situation in south Lebanon should not
continue. But he fell short of elaborating on what steps Israel
will take to end the situation.
</P>
<P>
In the early morning of Thursday, Hezbollah fired rockets and
mortars to posts of Israeli troops in the western and central
sectors of the "security zone" in south Lebanon, wounding two
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel has created the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon since 1985 after it withdrew the bulk of its troops
which invaded Lebanon in 1982. The invasion against Lebanon was
ordered by Sharon, then defense minister.
</P>
<P>
In last April, Israel offered to withdraw troops from south
Lebanon on condition that Lebanon agrees to guarantee the safety
of its northern border.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese government, backed by its powerful ally Syria, has
rejected the offer and demanded Israel leave its territory
unconditionally. Israel held Syria responsible for the Lebanese
stand, saying Damascus is using the Lebanese issue as a bargain
chip to press Israel to return the Golan Heights that it has
seized from Syria in 1967.

air ban was designed to force Libya to surrender two suspects of

<HEADLINE> C'Wealth Ready to Help Nigeria: Anyaoku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaoku said here Thursday afternoon that the
organization is ready to assist Nigeria for achieving a genuine
transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is at a crossroads and the historic opportunity now
available should not be missed, Anyaoku said at a press
conference before winding up his four-day visit to the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
It is clear the historic opportunity came with the sudden
death of former head of state, General Sani Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
New leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar has ordered the release
of about 30 political detainees and held wide consultation with
various interest groups in the country about the future of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
What Abubakar has done have won widely welcome both at home
and abroad because they are taken as steps toward establishing "a
credible democracy and a strong and united Nigeria," said
Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose of Anyaoku's visit is to hold discussions
with Abubakar and the two had three "good meetings" in the past
four days.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect that the new head of state of Nigeria will
before too long make a pronouncement on what the planned
transition for the country will be," Anyaoku told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We should await that announcement," said Anyaoku, who is from
Nigeria himself.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever plan the head of state announces should be a plan
that meets the general will of Nigerians," he said, adding that
Nigerians are all sick of military rules and want to see the
military quickly back to barracks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is ultimately for the Nigerians and
Nigerians alone to determine their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Commonwealth and Nigeria's many friends in the
international community remain ready to offer their solidarity
and support, as well as any assistance Nigeria may require.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said the 53-nation Commonwealth will be happy to help
Nigeria establish a new democratic order based on the experience
and expertise it has built up in facilitating and consolidating
transitions to multi-party democracy from military or one-party
rule in many other countries of the association.

<P>
The Commonwealth suspended the membership of Nigeria three
years ago when the Abacha administration hanged Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight Ogoni minority activists in defiance of international calls
for mercy.
</P>
<P>
Now at the historic time, Anyaoku said, "Nigeria will return
to full membership of the Commonwealth when it becomes a
democracy."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Abubakar has assured him that although
Nigeria believed it had been unfairly treated by the
Commonwealth, he wanted to look to the future and not the past.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit, Anyaoku said, he will give Nigerians
a message of hope that the new administration is aware of what
needs to be done to restore genuine national reconciliation, the
dignity and self-respect of Nigerians, the sense of national
security and Nigeria's place in the international community.

<HEADLINE> Government-Gazprom Conflict Gone in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The conflict between the Russian
government and gas giant Gazprom has been resolved "within hours"
on Thursday after Vice-Premier Boris Nemtsov made a mediation,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov had a telephone conversation with Gazprom chief Rem
Vyakhirev who is visiting Vienna to mark the 30th anniversary of
Russian natural gas supplies to Austria.
</P>
<P>
The government will not annul its trust agreement on the
management of its 35-percent stake in Gazprom as the gas company
committed itself to regular payment of taxes and other deductions
towards the federal budget, Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom will make all due payments to the federal budget fully,
and in return, the federal budget will clear its commitments on
gas consumption by government-financed organizations arising from
July 1, Nemtsov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said all debts accumulated by Gazprom before July 1, which
total from 12 billion to 13 billion rubles (about 2 billion U.S.
dollars), will be checked by a special task force for settling
reciprocal debts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko ordered
Nemtsov to abolish the trust agreement with Gazprom for its
shortage of tax payment and intended to convene an extraordinary
meeting of Gazprom shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom will pay the budget 4 billion rubles (some 645 million
U.S. dollars) each month, while the government will also have to
pay a considerable sum for gas, the deputy premier said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Thursday had telephone
conversations with Kiriyenko and presidential deputy chief of
staff Alexander Livshits on the Gazprom issue.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he found right the government's raising the
question of more role of the state in managing this "large and
system-forming Russian company which is a national wealth." But,
he noted the country needs the Gazprom gas monopoly to remain
strong. "
</P>
<P>
Gazprom - a gas giant of Russia - is consolidating 60 main
industrial regions of Russia and plays an extremely important role
in the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Iran Burns 51 Tonnes of Drugs (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- In a move to show its determination
to fight drugs, Iran on Thursday burned 50 tonnes of opium and one
ton of heroin at a ceremony in northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held to mark the occasion of the world
Anti-drug Day. Attending the ceremony were Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, Prosecutor General Morteza Moghtadai, United
Nations Drug Control and Production (UNCDP) chief Pino Arlachi and
some foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 young people cheered loudly when three archers shot
three burning arrows to the huge pile of drugs, which were worth
more than 800 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Khatami pledged to continue the
country's anti-drug fight, saying "as long as illegal drug
production exists in the world, we will continue our struggle
against drugs."
</P>
<P>
"We will fight all out against drug trafficking in the
country as we did during the past 20 years," he said, "and
we will encourage any cooperation with the UNCDP to control
and eliminate narcotics."
</P>
<P>
Head of Iran's anti-drug mission Mohammad Fallah said Iran has
allocated some 560 million dollars to install barriers along its
borders with Afghanistan and deployed 30,000 forces to prevent
drug smuggling through its eastern borders.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said that during the past two decades, Iran has lost
2,500 soldiers in armed clashes with drug traffickers, 97 of whom
died in the past Iranian year which ended on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Iran seized 195 tonnes of various narcotics in 1997 or 198
tonnes in the past Iranian year. But drug trafficking remains a
serious challenge because drug production in Afghanistan is
increasing and Iran is the shortest and cheapest transit road for
smuggling drugs to the European countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising Iran's important role in the anti-drug campaign,
Arlachi called on the international community to help Iran
continue its anti-drug fight because it neighbors Afghanistan, one
of the world biggest drug producing center.
</P>
<P>
To further UNCDP's cooperation with Iran, Arlachi said his
organization has decided to open an office in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Calls for Rushing Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official on Thursday
stressed the need to speed up the delivery of spare parts to
Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Benon Sevan, executive director of U.N. Iraq Program, told a
press conference that even if these spare parts would arrive in
Iraq in a short period of time, Iraq still could not export the
amount of oil that it is allowed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
He said that the drastic drop of oil prices on the world
markets was another reason to Iraq's possible failure to meet the
quota.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase of the oil-for-food program, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy
food, medicine and other daily necessities for its people. But
Iraq has said time and again that it could not pump more than 4
billion dollars of oil due to the lack of spare parts in its oil
sector and the drop of oil prices on the world markets.
</P>
<P>
He complained that though spare parts were crucial to the
increase of Iraq's oil export and that he had reported to the
U.N. secretary-general in a bid to speed up the approval of
allocating 300 million U.S. dollars for Iraq's oil sector, it
still took the Security Council 63 days to finish the process of
the approval.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. secretary-general and U.N. Iraq
Program are committed to their obligations towards Iraq and that
the Security Council and the U.N. Sanctions Committee were
responsible for the delay of the approval.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraq has signed 40 contracts with international
firms to purchase oil spare parts, but the U.N. Sanctions
Committee approved two of them up to now.
</P>
<P>
Sevan praised the cooperation of the Iraqi officials, and said
that the two sides have agreed to hold more talks when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Sevan met with Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan to discuss the ways to improve the implementation
of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan criticized U.S. representatives in
the U.N. Sanctions Committee for delaying and suspending hundreds
of oil-for-food contracts unjustifiably "in order to further
aggravate the Iraqi people's suffering and expose them to death."
</P>
<P>
Sevan, on his part, expressed his dissatisfaction with the
slow implementation of the oil-for-food contracts, saying he would
exert utmost efforts to speed up the implementation of these
contracts.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the U.N. secretary-general would follow
up this issue to help accomplish them as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Encourages British Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian vice president Omar
Ali Juma Thursday encouraged British businessmen to invest in
Tanzania whose economic environment has reportedly been
improving.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the visiting Chairman of the British Overseas
Trade Board, Martim Laing, Dr Juma said that the government is
trying various ways to raise the country's competitive
capabilities in absorbing foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and tranquility are among the factors which attract
many investors to Tanzania," he said. "Others include abundant
natural resources, fertile land and adequate water supply."
</P>
<P>
Laing, who arrived here Tuesday to support British
participation in the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair, said
that he was impressed by Tanzania's progress to revive the
economy, promising more British investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the British High Commission has said that
Britain will play a very active role in the annual 22nd Dar es
Salaam International Fair which will officially open Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Participants in the British Pavilion include British Airways,
the Commonwealth Development Corporation, CMC Land Rover, BP
(Tanzania) Ltd, Standard Chartered Bank and others," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in 1997, Britain exported 77
million pounds worth of goods to Tanzania, mainly road vehicles,
textile fibers and machinery.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania exports to Britain, primarily agricultural products,
were worth 33.1 million pounds over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislators to Visit U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative Council
(PLC) Speaker Abu Ala (Ahmed Queria) Thursday called "a positive
step" the invitation from U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich asking
PLC members to visit the U.S. congress.
</P>
<P>
Ala will head a 10-member PLC delegation on its first visit to
the Capitol Hill later this month, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as describing the invitation as "a positive step
towards the opening of dialog" between the PLC and the
U.S. Congress, which he said was "very pro-Israel."
</P>
<P>
The coming visit was mainly a result of the meeting between
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and
Gingrich, which was held in Ramallah later May and hailed by both
sides as "positive." PNA officials said the meeting had created "a
real dialog" between the Palestinians and the Congress for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
During that talks, Gingrich suggested exchange of visits
between Palestinian and U.S. legislators.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been at odds with the Congress over what
they call its pro-Israel stand, especially its position on the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Congress passed a bill three years ago mandating the
U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to be moved to Jerusalem by May 31, 1999,
which would amount to a recognition of Israel's claim to the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Israel in May, Gingrich outraged the
Palestinians by openly claiming that Jerusalem, whose status will
be determined in the final status talks, should remain the "united
and eternal capital of Israel."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Visits Cyprus for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan's Special Advisor for Cyprus Diego Cordovez arrived
here Thursday for talks on resuming the peace process of the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Cordovez is expected to hold separate
meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides described it as "useful," but he said "we are not
anticipating any significant outcome."
</P>
<P>
United States Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill expressed
hope that Cordovez's visit will be "productive" and "help the
process move toward direct negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish
Cypriots broke down last summer when Denktash refused to continue
the process to protest against European Union's decision to start
accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash says he will not return to the talks unless his
breakaway entity in northern Cyprus is internationally recognized
and Cyprus' efforts to win EU membership is suspended.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit followed the adoption of two resolutions on
Cyprus by the U.N. Security Council early this week. The
resolutions call on the leaders of Cyprus' two communities to
"resume the direct dialog without further delay."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island to protect
the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed coup by the Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara against the
internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying to reunify the island in a bizonal and
bicommunal formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Directors of a subsidiary of
Canadian-owned Omni-Vision Africa operating wireless
communications, have made plans of introducing a national
television system here to provide various programs and news to
Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
They made clear their plan when meeting Minister of State in
charge of information Basoga Nsadhu here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The system will provide local and foreign news, educational
programs, interactive information services and entertainment
programs on a subscription basis.
</P>
<P>
Omni-Vision Africa, with its regional headquarters in Kampala,
is soon starting paging and wireless television services in the
east African country, the directors said.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide cable/wireless TV network will be very
important to the development of the country's growing economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister encouraged their plans and emphasized the crucial
role of information in catalyzing development.
</P>
<P>
Nsadhu added that the private sector's investment in
information transmission programs will supplement government's
efforts in this direction.
</P>
<P>
He said that his department will cooperate and give ready help
to these investors in their endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Communication in Uganda is rather backward. Many parts of the
country cannot receive TV signals and teledensity is only 0.2
percent. And the educational programs are badly needed.

UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has set up a panel of eminent persons on a fact-finding
mission to Algeria, his spokesman announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this mission will be to gather information on
the situation in Algeria and present a report to him, which he
will make public," the spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian Government which invited Annan to do so, will
ensure "free and complete access to all sources of information
necessary for the panel to exercise its functions in order to have
a clear vision and a precise perception of the reality of the
situation in all its dimensions in Algeria today", he said.
</P>
<P>
An internal conflict, involving an Islamic movement, has hit
the country since 1992, with casualties numbering between 65,000
and 75,000 by Western accounts.
</P>
<P>
Headed by former Portuguese President Mario Soares, the panel
includes former Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, former
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Karim Kabariti, former American
U.N. Permanent Representative Donald McHenry, former French
Secretary of State Simone Veil and Kenyan Attorney-General Amos
Wako.

In their presentation at a function here Wednesday, Mark

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Sanctions against Latvia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Thursday denied the allegation from Latvia that it is taking
economic sanctions against the Baltic country, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the foreign ministry Vladimir Rakhmanin told a
briefing that Russia is not applying any economic sanctions
against Latvia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government cancelled discounts on international
carriage of most freight going to Latvia from the beginning of
July. It seems for the Baltic state to be an economic sanction
against Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin, however, said the measures were taken "in order to
streamline trade and economic relations with Latvia" and should
not be regarded as sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs said that
Riga is preparing to launch a campaign to notify international
financial organization about Russia's economic pressure on Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Birkavs said that Russia is violating the principles and rules
of the International Monetary Fund and other international
financial organizations and is violating the joint communique of
the Group of Eight energy ministers on free transit of goods.
</P>
<P>
He noted despite Russia's statements on the need to protect its
national economic interests, many measures are aimed precisely
against Latvia. "This is especially evident in trade, the banking
sector, the energy sector, freight transit and road carriage,"
Birkavs said.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian official warned that Riga will inform the IMF, the
World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
about the development of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Croatia to Commit Obligations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its presidential statement, the Council expressed its
grave concern that a large number of Serb residents and
displaced persons have emigrated from the Republic of Croatia
since late 1996, mainly because of continued security incidents,
ethnically related intimidation, a dire economic situation,
bureaucratic hurdles, discriminatory legislation and a stalled
return program.
</P>
<P>
The Council noted the continuation of this trend could
have a seriously negative effect on the restoration of a
multi-ethnic society in the Republic of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the adoption by the Government of
Croatia, on June 20, 1998, of a nationwide "Programme for the
Return and Accommodation of Displaced Persons, Refugees and
Resettled Persons" and called for its prompt and full
implementation at all levels, including the abolition of
discriminatory property laws and the establishment of effective
mechanisms allowing owners to recover their property.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon the Government of Croatia to improve
police response to ethnically-related incidents, evictions and
housing intimidation cases and to take other measures to
strengthen public confidence in the police.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its full support for the activities of
the United Nations Police Support Group and the United Nations
Liaison Office in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
It welcomed the decision of the Organization For Security
and Co-operation in Europe of 25 June 1998 to deploy civilian
police monitors to assume, by 15 October 1998, the
responsibilities of te United Nations Police Support Group.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Legislature Denounces Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) issued a statement in the West Bank city Ramallah
Thursday, strongly denouncing Israel's plan to strengthen its hold
on the disputed holy city Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem is
"illegal and discriminatory and is in violation of international
law and resolutions of the United Nations," the East
Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center quoted the PLC statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The PLC stressed that East Jerusalem is occupied Palestinian
territory according to United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, and the Palestinian side can not accept
any unilateral expansion of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the United States, as a sponsor of the
Middle East peace process and an ally of Israel, to take a firm
and just position on the Arab-Israel conflict in general, and the
issue of Jerusalem in particular.
</P>
<P>
The PLC also reaffirmed its support to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's call for holding an urgent Arab summit as well as
a conference of foreign ministers of Islamic countries to address
the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the Security Council to adopt a resolution
denouncing the Jerusalem expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the PLC special session in Ramallah on Wednesday,
Arafat already condemned the Israeli expansion plan and called on
the Palestinian people to fight to the end to protect the
territorial integrity of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
urged Arafat to stop incitement that could threaten the security
of Jewish residents in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Israel has occupied the
traditionally Arab East Jerusalem since 1967 and declared it as
its eternal capital, but the Palestinians want East Jerusalem to
be the capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem's status should be settled
through the Israeli-Palestinian permanent talks.

European Local and Regional Powers Congress is to debate policies
of investments as well as regional development on pan-European
level.
</P>
<P>
"Political will is needed for the achievement of regional and

"International business partnership, especially in the field of
small and middle-sized enterprises becomes increasingly important

cohesion," Roman added.
</P>
<P>
According to Romanian national Rompres news agency, Forum's

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Hold High-Level Discussion on World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a session next week on world
trade, featuring the impact of the Asian economic crisis, ECOSOC
announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Not only investment flows but international trade patterns
are in a period of volatility following the 1997-98 East Asian
shock wave, conference sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled for July 6-8, takes place when growth in
dollar value of world exports is forecast to fall to roughly 2.5
percent in 1998 compared with 2.7 percent in 1997 and 4.3
percent in 1996, according to a U.N. survey.
</P>
<P>
A rapid drop in East Asian demand is reducing exports of
industrialized and developing countries, while East Asian exports
are hampered by a lack of financing.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has pulled down commodity prices and renewed fears
of protectionism in the industrialized markets at a time when
emerging markets are struggling to maintain financial stability in
large part through strong exports, ECOSOC noted.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian, Israeli Soldiers Square Off in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tension flared up in Gaza
Thursday as Palestinian and Israeli security forces squareed off
in a dispute over a road, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The standoff erupted when the Palestinian security forces
tried to prevent Israelis from entering the settlements inside
Gaza in retaliation for Israel's closing of a section of the
coastal road in Gaza, the Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday morning, Israeli security forces closed the
coastal road between Khan Yunis and Deir Al-Balah and prevented
Abu Ali Shaheen, an official of the Palestinian National
Authority, from traveling to his office in Gaza via this road.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials said that this was a violation
of the signed agreements which stipulate that Palestinians can use
this road without any hindrance.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sent reinforcements to Gaza in case the standoff
could escalate into conflict. Local reporters were prevented from
reaching the scene.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Gaza is very tense and many cars are still
parting on the side of the road in protest against its closure.

<HEADLINE> Increased UN Presence Called for in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Three west African leaders have
jointly called for an increased United Nations presence in Sierra
Leone to complement the sub-regional efforts at promoting peace
and security in that country.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a mini-ECOWAS (Economic Community of West
African States) forum chaired by Nigeria's new leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar, with visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in attendance.
</P>
<P>
President Charles Taylor of Liberia and President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah of Sierra Leone attended the meeting in the Nigerian
capital Abuja, which addressed a number of regional and
sub-regional issues.
</P>
<P>
A six-point communique issued Thursday and signed by the three
leaders and Annan, stated that the meeting discussed the need for
improved security and cooperation between Liberia and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held Wednesday, also considered "what
confidence-building measures could be introduced by the two
countries and how the UN and ECOWAS could assist."
</P>
<P>
Liberia has been accused of supporting Sierra Leone's ousted
junta and allied rebels in their fighting against Kabbah's
government and the west African peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The communique stated that in the presence of the ECOWAS
chairman and Annan, the heads of state of Liberia and Sierra
Leone reached agreement on seven thorny issues affecting their
two countries, and pledged their support for the deployment of UN
and ECOMOG observers along their borders.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also condemned the continued rebel activities in
Sierra Leone as well as the "horrendous atrocities" that have
been committed.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their determination to cooperate and promote an
end to the fighting in Sierra Leone and foster peace and security
in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the remnants of the ousted junta and
allied rebels have launched a violent campaign against the
civilian population in the eastern and northern parts of the
country, perpetrating killing and maiming by chopping of people's
hands and legs.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that both Taylor and Kabbah had
reaffirmed their commitment not to allow their territories to be
used for actions aimed at destabilizing the other, drawing
attention to the need to control the activities and movements of
demobilized former combatants.
</P>
<P>
It stated that both Taylor and Kabbah have agreed to check the
involvement of their citizens in destabilizing activities, and
urged the two leaders to commit those involved in such subversive
activities to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The communique also expressed "grave concern" over the
situation in Guinea Bissau, and noted the on-going consultations
among ECOWAS member states on this matter.
</P>
<P>
It also commended the initiative by the Nigerian leader and
the UN secretary-general in facilitating the mini-summit.

<HEADLINE> Blair Visits Belfast Seeking to Diffuse Parade Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
made a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday in an attempt to
avert violence at a controversial parade on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Blair first visited one of 10 Catholic churches
attacked by suspected loyalist arsonists Wednesday night and met
parish priest Father John O'Sullivan and toured the devastated St
James's Church near Crumlin, Co Antrim, in west Belfast.
</P>
<P>
He denied the arson attacks were a setback to the peace process
he has spearheaded.
</P>
<P>
"The act of destruction that we see behind, that is the past in
Northern Ireland. We are trying to give the people a future that
leaves these acts of barbarism behind us," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But his main purpose to visit Northern Ireland was to diffuse
parade tension in the province. Protestant "Orangemen" will defy
an official ban and march through a Catholic area of Drumcree on
the edge of Portadown, southwest of Belfast on Sunday, which is
strongly against by the local Catholics. The parade in the past
two years has sparked riots between the Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he had not come to negotiate over a decision by the
province's independent Parades Commission barring the Orangemen
from parading along the Catholic Garvaghy Road in Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
"That's not something I can do," Blair said. "What I can do is
to ask people to listen to the voice of reason...the best thing
that can possibly happen is that people come together and agree."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is also due to visit Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing assembly, which opened its doors on Wednesday and
elected a pro-British Protestant as its first minister and a
Catholic nationalist as his deputy.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Production To Be Second Only To Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is now
forecast at 598m. tons, 6m. more than last month and second only
to the record 609m. in 1997, International Grains Council (IGC)
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The revision is attributed to higher figures to Australia,
China, India, Pakistan, Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, prospects for trade declined further over the past
month, with larger domestic harvests reducing import requirements
in several countries, especially India and Pakistan, according to
IGC.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is put at 1m. higher at 600m. tons, or
12m. more than last season. Feed use is expected to rise by about
2m. to 100m tons.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for world wheat stocks is 129m. a decline of 2m.
from 1997/98, the Council said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Abiola Wants to Go Home: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Thursday confirmed that he met with
detained Moshood Abiola Tuesday privately.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan, Abiola, widely believed to have won the
annulled June 12, 1993 presidential polls, indicated his
intention "to go home and continue with his life" after in
detention for four years, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
But the official news agency did not confirm a report earlier
Thursday which quoted Annan as saying that the Nigerian
government had assured him the release of all the political
detainees, numbered more than 200.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, that Abiola now was
"more realistic on the problems of the country than others
outside."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the opposition leader told him that he had
no knowledge of the events in the country in the past four years
and that he would need to go home and know what the situation is.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said that Abiola informed him that "he would be
naive to think that he would just come out of detention and
become the president just like that."
</P>
<P>
After the sudden death of Nigeria's former military ruler
General Sani Abacha on June 8, the country has come to a
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
The new head of state, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, has said
that he will continue the current transition to civil rule
program in the way which will come out of the wide consultations
with various interest groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups in the country have mounting pressures for
the release of Abiola to lead a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Nigeria Monday for consultations with
Nigerian leaders on the country's transition to democracy
program.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nigeria, he also held wide-ranging
consultations with segments of the society, including traditional
rulers, politicians, women leaders, labor, employers, the media,
industrialists and individuals.
</P>
<P>
He said he also met General Abubakar, members of the
Provisional Ruling Council which is the highest decision-making
body of the country, ministers and the National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria as well as some former Nigerian heads of
state, including the just released General Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"I found total unanimity on a number of important issues" in
the meetings with Nigerians, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Among these issues, he said, were an insistence on a return to
democracy, a transition in which Nigerians can have confidence, a
peaceful, democratic and above all credible process leading to
free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
"All Nigerians want to live under the rule of law, with full
respect for human rights, including freedom of expression and
association," Annan said, adding that "everyone I met wants the
military to return to its proper role in a democratic society."
</P>
<P>
He also said that everyone wants the remaining political
prisoners and detainees including Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya and
others to be released.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, everyone wants to see an end to Nigeria's political
and economic isolation," the UN secretary-general added.
</P>
<P>
While the UN and the international community stood ready to
assist in finding a solution, said Annan, "the answer to
Nigeria's problems has to be found by Nigerians themselves."
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, Annan, an African secretary-general of
the world body, has been given much credit by Africans to the
handling of the problems in African countries.
</P>
<P>
His mediation in Nigeria's current political crisis is
expected to help find solutions to the problems afflicting the
country.

LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded a record 109,189,502

</P>
<P>
The LIFFE announced here Thursday that it traded its busiest
June ever, trading a record 18,136,592 futures and options
contracts, 6 percent up on June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Average daily trading volume amounted to 824,391 futures and

</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, the LIFFE's chairman, said, "LIFFE continues

JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- After two days of recovery
from a record low, the South African Rand nose-dived again
Thursday, South African national television reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rand dropped to 6.32 against the U.S. Dollar and 10.35
against the British Pound in Thursday's trading. It closed at
6.26 against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the currency has driven interest rates to
as high as 22.25 percent, which will dampen economic growth and
may push up inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that inflation could reach eight percent by
the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Sanctions on Swiss Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government opposes the
sanctions that U.S. states and cities are proposing to impose on
Swiss banks over Nazi gold, said the State Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the sanctions would
be "unjustified, unwarranted and counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
"They will prevent our nation from speaking with one voice on
matters of foreign policy, they will call into question the
openness of our financial markets and they may lead to greater
inflexibility on the part of the Swiss institutions," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. states and cities, which manage their own finances,
are trying to make the Swiss banks improve their offer in
litigation over assets they acquired during World War II when
Switzerland enjoyed a neutral status.
</P>
<P>
Rubin urged the two sides, the banks and lawyers for Holocaust
survivors who filed class-action suits, to reach a quick
settlement and avoid recriminations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is imperative to deal with ageing and fragile
Holocaust survivors as promptly as possible. A prolonged
litigation is not in the interests of either side. It will deny
prompt justice to victims in their lifetime," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We call on both sides to reflect on the consequences of going
down the road of protracted litigation and recriminations. Before
any actions are taken, we ask both sides to consider a return to
the negotiations," he said.

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests in Water Treatment Facility in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) Thursday announced the approval of a 25 million
U.S. dollar loan for Binh An Water Corporation Lt. (BAWC) to
construct and operate the first private water treatment facility
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
BAWC will undertake the project on a Build-Operate-Transfer
(BOT) basis under a 20-year contract with the People's Committee
and the Water Supply Company of Ho Chi Minh City in southern
Vietnam. The treated water will be sold to the Water Supply
Company. By helping to ensure the efficient supply of clean water
to the entire city, BAWC is likely to have an important
demonstration effect.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City is Vietnam's largest city with an estimated
population of over 5 million. Current average water usage by
residents is 140 liters a day and is expected to increase to 180
liters a day by 2001. When the plant is completed in 1999, it will
supply 100,000 cubic meters a day of treated water, representing
an estimated 11 percent to the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's financing package consists of a loan of up to 12.5
million dollars for its own account and a syndicated loan of up to
12.5 million dollars for the account of commercial banks and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, and also the
largest multilateral source for private sector projects for
developing countries.

<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Thursday denounced a missile attack by the United
States on an Iraqi missile site, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. attack, Abdel-Meguid voiced objection to
"any interference in Iraq's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He called on the concerned parties to exercise restraint in
this sensitive area and avoid taking any moves that could lead to
regional instability and tension.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. fighter plane Tuesday fired a missile at a radar in an
Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery. The U.S. said the radar
illuminated four British patrol planes in the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the missile hit some water tanks 12 kilometers north of
Um-Khasir city in Basra Province.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid criticized the military act for affecting the
livelihood of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a visit to Syria Wednesday night,
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that the 22-member Arab organization
is opposed to aggression against any Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Tuesday denied it targeted the British patrol planes and
called the U.S. attack another proof of hostile policy toward
Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has given his consent to the land bill which was passed by the
parliament on Monday after making various amendments.
</P>
<P>
Museveni gave his approval Wednesday evening in the southern
Mpigi district.
</P>
<P>
The land bill, which has made headlines for quite a long time
in this east African country, was presented to the president
after staying on the table of the parliament for eight days for
amendment and enlargement.
</P>
<P>
When commenting the land bill, the Prime Minister Kintu Musoke
said: "I am very happy. This is the first time in my lifetime
for a land law in this country to be debated and passed by a
democratically-elected body."
</P>
<P>
The bill passed by the parliament is reported to be
fundamentally different from the original one that was introduced
in March to a lot of controversy. It has 93 sections as opposed
to the original which had 72.
</P>
<P>
The legislation of the bill provides for security of tenure of
the bona fide and lawful occupants while at the same time
recognizing freehold and lease holders.
</P>
<P>
It further elevates customary land tenure to the same status
as freehold.
</P>
<P>
The land bill also establishes mechanism for settling land
disputes at local levels and entitles the land owners whose land
has been taken by government for the resettlement of other people
to compensation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits HARM Missile Missed Iraqi Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon admitted Thursday
that a U.S. missile fired by F-16 fighter Tuesday failed to hit
its target -- an Iraqi radar site in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed anti-radiation missile, or HARM, "likely
impacted in a remote area near the radar site in the vicinity of
Al Basra," said Pentagon spokesman Marine Lt. Col Patrick Sivigny.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect to locate the precise impact location," he
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S officials have said that the F-16 fighter fired the HARM
missile at the radar site Tuesday as its pilot received signal
that four British Tornadoes conducting patrol missions over the
no-fly zone in southern Iraq were locked on by the Iraqi radar.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq dismissed the U.S. statements as mere "lies."
</P>
<P>
"The American officials know that they are telling their people
and the world public opinion lies because they know that the
missile landed in a demilitarized zone near the city of Umm Qasir
in which there were no Iraqi radars or military units," said a
spokesman for the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and Information.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, trying to head off Iraq's condemnation, cited
several possible reasons why the missile missed the Iraqi target.
</P>
<P>
One reason may have been a failure by the HARM, which homes in
on a source of radiation, to lock onto the site's radar
"signature," but the radar might have quickly switched off after
illuminating the British aircraft, Sivigny said. "Or there may be
other factors," he said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
U.S officials assumed that the Tuesday incident was an isolated
event rather than the start of any new military challenge to the
no-fly zones, imposed by the United States and its allies since
the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy to Have More Talks With Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will start
another round of diplomacy to resolve the conflict in Kosovo, with
mediator Richard Holbrooke returning to Belgrade Friday.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, nominated last month by President Bill Clinton to be
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, would meet Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic for a cease-fire in Kosovo, said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robert Gelbard, the special envoy on the Balkans,
will also go back to the region while U.S. Ambassador to Belgrade
Chirstopher Hill was meeting Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
in the Kosovo capital of Pristina Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin described the new U.S. initiative as a "full-court
diplomatic press."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will press Milosevic "to pull back his forces, stop
the crackdown, stop the use of heavy military equipment, and start
the use of the good sense of negotiations to resolve this
problem," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Rubin signaled the administration has eased its
demand for an immediate withdrawal of Serb forces in Kosovo. He
stressed there should be a cease-fire first before the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
That may ensure that ethnic Albanian fighters do not seize the
opportunity of a troop withdrawal to rush in to fill the vacuum
and gain more territory in Kosovo, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, we don't expect to see that kind of
pullback in the absence of a cease-fire. That doesn't mean we
wouldn't prefer to see it without a cease-fire, but as a practical
matter, that in our view, is the most likely sequence," he added.
</P>
<P>
The shift was the second major move by the administration in
the past week to try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to the
conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rubin said the dialogue between the ethnic Albanian
leadership and Belgrade should be open to the armed Albanian
insurgents who had been denounced previously as acting like
terrorists.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Childrens' Fund
(UNICEF) has given Zambia 5.5 million doses of oral vaccines
worth of about 500,000 U.S. Dollars for the country's polio
vaccination program.
</P>
<P>
At the donation ceremony at Lusaka International Airport
Tuesday, UNICEF Representative Peter Mcdernott said that the
Zambian government has achieved tremendous success in its efforts
to eradicate polio, the Zambia News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the need to continue vaccinating the
children every year, saying that the conflicts in Zambia's
neighboring countries could spread the polio virus to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Wilfred Boayue, World Health
Organization Representative in Zambia, said that the preparations
for this year's polio vaccination program have reached an
advanced stage.

<HEADLINE> CNN, Time Retract Report on Vietnam Nerve Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cable News Network (CNN)
Television and Time Magazine Thursday retracted a report that the
U.S. military used Sarin nerve gas to kill American defectors
during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
CNN said its internal investigation concluded that its June 7
broadcast on the 1970 Tailwind operation in Laos "cannot be
supported."
</P>
<P>
"There is insufficient evidence that Sarin or any other deadly
gas was used," CNN News Group Chairman Tom Johnson said in a
statement. "Furthermore, CNN cannot confirm that American
defectors were targeted or at the camp."
</P>
<P>
He said Cable News Network acknowledged "serious faults in the
use of the sources who provided... the original reports and
therefore retract the Tailwind story. We apologize to our viewers
and to our colleagues at Time for this mistake."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Time Magazine made a similar statement. "Like CNN,
Time is retracting the story and apologizing for running it," Time
managing editor Walter Isaacson said. "Based on our own
investigation and that concluded by CNN, we have concluded that
the facts simply do not support the allegations that were made."
</P>
<P>
CNN and Time report said U.S. forces used Sarin gas in Laos
during Operation Tailwind to kill American soldiers who had
deserted and the gas was used by U.S. forces in about 20
operations during the war.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon stated that it had found no evidence of any use of
Sarin gas in Operation Tailwind or any evidence of any mission to
go after U.S. Vietnam War defectors.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered an investigation in
response to the report by CNN and Time.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send a
mission to Nigeria and discuss political transition issues with
its new leader Gen. Abdulasalam Abubakar, the State Department
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the visit is to offer our support for the new
leadership's recent release of political prisoners and to discuss
steps we think could facilitate the transition to democratic
civilian government in Nigeria," spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The mission, led by Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering,
will leave Washington for Nigeria on the weekend and meet Abubakar
on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States welcomed recent announcements by
Nigeria's new government that all political prisoners will soon be
released. "The release of political prisoners could be a key step
in the transition to civilian government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mission has originally scheduled its visit to Nigeria
in June, but called the trip off because the late Nigerian
President Sani Abacha set some preconditions which Washington
deemed unacceptable.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investors renewed their
interest in equities of emerging markets in the first quarter this
year, the U.S. Security Industry Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Net U.S. purchases of securities from these markets hit 2.8
billion U.S. dollars, sharply reversing the net sales posture of
401 billion dollars in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Among foreign markets, Asian emerging markets attracted 2.5
billion dollars in equities from U.S. investors, accounting for
the strongest quarter since 3.3 billion dollars recorded in the
first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among other key findings, foreign investment in U.S. equities
rose to a record high of 29 billion dollars in the first quarter,
but foreign investors shifted sharply away from U.S. Treasuries
towards corporate bonds and other securities, ending a
three-year-long opposite trend.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 800 securities firms as members, the Security
Industry Association covers 90 percent of the securities business
done in North America.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Pays for Using Internet Explorer Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world's software
giant, has settled a trademark lawsuit, agreeing to pay 5 million
U.S. dollars for the right to continue using the name Internet
Explorer for its strategically important browser software.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of a jury trial in Chicago, Microsoft reached
a settlement with lawyers for SyNet, a defunct Illinois software
company that claimed the right to the Internet Explorer trademark.
</P>
<P>
The company first used the name for its Internet browser in
1994, about one year earlier than Microsoft did.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft argued that Internet Explorer is a common descriptive
term, meaning a device to explore, and could be used widely by
software makers in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if a jury had decided SyNet in fact had the
right to the Internet Explorer name, Microsoft could have been
forced to spend an estimated 30 million U.S. dollars to remove the
words from its software, packaging and manuals.
</P>
<P>
SyNet founder Dhiren Rana, a British immigrant, claimed his
company was forced to ask for bankruptcy protection in part
because its legal battle with Microsoft cost too much.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which the company gives away for
free and distributes as part of its various Windows operating
systems, is at the core of the efforts by the government to show
that the software giant is extending its monopoly into the
Internet market.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Asks for Immediate Access to 150,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) has asked the government of Guinea for
immediate access to camps housing more than 150,000 Sierra Leonean
refugees, cut off from humanitarian aid for almost three weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated July 3 to President Lansana Conte of Guinea,
UNHCR chief Mrs Sadako Ogata requested the authorities to re-open
roads to refugee sites near the border with Sierra Leone so that
UNHCR and other aid agencies can deliver desperately needed food,
water and medical care.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees' situation is all the more preoccupying because
they arrived in Guinea in very poor health, and the already-high
mortality rates are likely to reach even more alarming levels
because of this interruption of our aid operation," she said.
</P>
<P>
The area bordering Sierra Leone, to the southwest of the
Guinean town of Gueckedou, has been off-limits for aid deliveries
since June 15, according to UNHCR. Local officials have cited
security concerns in denying access.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR and the World Food Program have been racing to stabilize
the health and nutritional situation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Malnutrition and mortality, particularly among young children,
were already very high before the aid cut-off," said UNHCR. "Many
of those crossing into Guinea in the last weeks had not received a
first food ration when access was blocked."
</P>
<P>
UNHCR warned that work on latrines and clean water supply has
also stopped, raising the risk of disease in dozens of sites.

<P>
TOKYO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices finished higher for the
eighth straight day in Tokyo Friday as brisk speculation and still
more purchases by foreign investors countered selling by
brokerages after recent rises.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 39.66 points, or 0.24
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 16,511.24.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, however, slipped 2.10 points or 0.17
percent to 1,268.36.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 581
million shares from Thursday's 924.43 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei extended its impressive streak of gains to eight
trading days stemming back to June 24, and has picked up 1,456.64
points during that period.
</P>
<P>
Trading was erratic in the morning and afternoon sessions. The
Nikkei plunged by more than 160 points just minutes after the
opening bell, but quickly regained most of that as investors
snapped up attractively priced technology shares.
</P>
<P>
The index later dropped to a session low of 16,289.66 early in
the afternoon, but then jumped to a high of 16,625.42 on news that
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto suggested during an
election campaign speech that a permanent income tax cut may take
place next year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, losers edged
gainers 630 to 532, with 126 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar moved lower
against the yen after the Japanese currency was given a boost by
Hashimoto's verbal support for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 139.23-25 yen at 5 p.m. (local time),
down from 140.55-58 yen at 9 a.m., and from 140.65-75 yen late
Thursday in New York.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Rejects Criticism By Malaysian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore Foreign Ministry
spokesman Friday rejected criticism by some Malaysian newspapers
of Singapore's "deliberate exclusion" of Malaysia from a list of
tours offered to participants of a planned international
conference.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Singapore government has investigated
the matter and found the allegations "completely unfounded."
</P>
<P>
"The misleading and inaccurate allegations that have been made
bear no relationship to the fact and do not contribute to good
bilateral relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, several Malaysian newspapers
reported that the Singapore organizer of Rotary Convention to be
held in the city state next year has excluded Malaysia from a list
of countries to be visited by participants of the planned
convention.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Rotary Club was quoted by the papers as saying
that the omission of Peninsula Malaysia from the list of tours
offered to participants in the convention brochure was an
"oversight which can be rectified."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the brochure prepared by an American company
that acts as operator of pre- and post-convention tours has given
prominence to East Malaysia and still mentioned West Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Far from being excluded, Malaysia has been more than
adequately promoted in other ways as a pre- and post-conference
destination," the spokesman said, adding Malaysia was specifically
promoted as a tourist destination at related meetings for the
scheduled 1999 Singapore Rotary conference.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the Singapore Tourism Board routinely
encourages major convention organizers holding events in Singapore
to offer pre- and post-conference tours to neighboring
destinations including Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar, while answering
questions in parliament earlier this week, acknowledged that there
were some outstanding matters being under negotiations between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the two neighboring countries have not
reached agreement on extending water supply to Singapore beyond
the expiry dates of the present water agreements and on the
development of Malayan Railway Land in Singapore as well as the
withdrawal conditions for West Malaysian's Central Provident Fund
savings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Friday
pledged an equivalent of 1.43 million U.S. dollars in aid to the
victims in the Philippines and Uruguay who have suffered from El
Nino-caused freak weather.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the deal, the European Commission, executive arm of
the 15-member bloc, said the emergency aid will be managed by the
E.U. European Community Humanitarian Office, and the programs will
start in the coming few months.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. aid will finance food aid, health care and shelter for
families affected.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, El Nino caused a drought that left the
country with less than half its normal rainfall for the rainy
season and more than 700,000 people are facing serious food
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said some people in the Asian country had
to eat poisonous plant roots that had already claimed some 50
lives.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HKSAR government's Accounts for 1997-98 Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The total revenue of the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
for the financial year 1997-98 amounted to 275.2 billion HK
dollars (35.28 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Its total expenditure was 194.3 billion HK dollars (24.91
billion U.S. dollars), thus resulting in a surplus of 80.9 billion
HK dollars (10.37 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The surplus is 3.9 billion HK dollar (500 million U.S. dollar)
higher than the revised estimate of 77 billion HK dollars (9.87
Billion U.S. dollars) announced by the Financial Secretary in his
Budget speech in February.
</P>
<P>
The government's accounts for the financial year 1997-98 which
ended on March 31 were published in the Gazette Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the accounts, revenue was 600 million HK dollar
(76.92 million U.S. dollar) higher and expenditure 3.3 billion HK
dollar (423 million U.S. dollar) lower than anticipated at the
time of the revised estimate.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said: "despite the economic downturn,
overall revenue collections were in line with expectations."
</P>
<P>
"The underspending of less than two percent was spread across a
wide range of items," he said.
</P>
<P>
After taking account of the net worth of the Land Fund of 203.1
billion HK dollars (26.04 billion U.S. dollars), the government's
total fiscal reserves amounted to 457.5 billion HK dollars (58.65
billion U.S. dollars) at March 31, this year.

<HEADLINE> Conference Opens on Party Building in Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh National Work
Conference on Party Building in Universities opened at the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening were Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li
Lanqing, all members of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Li hailed the remarkable achievements made in the field of
Party building in recent years due to efforts by Party
organizations in localities, universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the proportion of CPC-affiliated students has kept
rising in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
To arm the university teachers and students with Deng
Xiaoping Theory is the principal task for strengthening the
Party building work in universities and fundamentally ensuring the
normal operation of the universities to foster century-striding
builders and successors of the socialist modernization cause, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPC Central Committee has attached great
importance to helping university students study Deng Xiaoping
Theory.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory must be included in college textbooks,
studied in classes, and kept in the brains of students, Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said more qualified young university teachers should be
fostered who would be good both in moral and professional
skills. It is an imperative and urgent task, he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being jointly held by the Organizational
Department and the Publicity Department under the CPC Central
Committee.

BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission approved
Friday further aid worth 1.565 million ECU (1.62 million U.S.
dollars) to Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of the medical aid package, 850,000 ECU in
all, will be used to help curb a tuberculosis surge in Siberia and
the Transcarpathians, the latter a mountainous region in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Another 465,000 ECU will be used in the prevention and
treatment of thyroid cancer in the aftermath of the Chernobyl
nuclear plant disaster.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of thyroid cancer among children affected by the
Chernobyl meltdown is still going up, according to health
organization sources.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission provided 250,000 ECU for relief
programs in northeastern Siberia, where fast-melting ice in freak
weather conditions has led to flooding that affected about 170,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said many factory and public buildings had
been damaged, but further flooding is still expected.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official Says No Talks With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Judiciary Supervisor-General
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi stated on Friday Iran would not talk on
relations with the United Sates as far as Washington continues its
"hegemonistic and arrogant policies."
</P>
<P>
Yazdi made the remark at the Friday prayer congregation on
Tehran University campus on the anniversary of the downing of
Iranian air passenger by the U.S. in July, 1988, killing 290
passengers aboard.
</P>
<P>
This was the most shameful measure committed by the
U.S. against the Iranian people, the Iranian official news agency
IRNA quoted him as saying, adding that "it would be wrong to
assume that Iranian people would easily forget the tragic event."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
voiced Washington's readiness to explore ways to rebuild
confidence with Tehran in order to resume relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran replied that the U.S. needs to take concrete
actions instead of good words to prove its sincerity in relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has never apologized to Iran for the
downing of the airliner which had been taken for a jet fighter,
but terming it as a mistake. It even awarded a medal of bravery to
the commander of the warship which shot down the Iranian plane,
Iranian officials have frequently criticized.
</P>
<P>
However, the case of reparations for Iranian victims is nearly
completed, the official in charge of the case Eftekhar Jahromi
said on Wednesday, so far 220 of the victims' families have
received reparations while the files concerning 14 others are
being completed.
</P>
<P>
Nine other files relating to the case have been sent to the
Swiss embassy which takes charge of the American interests in
Iran, he said, and the families of five victims have not made a
claim yet.
</P>
<P>
Jahromi said that a total of 54.45 million U.S. dollars have
so far been paid to the victims' families and 40 million dollars
as compensation for the downed airplane.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Stabilized Small-Scale Farmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Friday urged the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member countries to
stabilize small-scale farmer production.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Vice-President Christon Tembo said, "It is the duty of
governments to facilitate the creation of such an environment"
for the stabilized small scale farmer production because small
scale farmers "cannot do much in brightening about such an
environment."
</P>
<P>
In a opening speech at the meeting of SADC Ministers of Food,
Agriculture and Natural Resources here, he called on the member
countries to make a credit facility accessible to the small scale
famers and create a ready market for farm produce.
</P>
<P>
He also called on governments to provide the farmers with
appropriate technologies, basic rural infrastructure, such as
reasonable feeder roads, food storage facilities and low cost
irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
The small scale farmers, who comprise the majority of the
farmers in the region, should be engaged in the cash economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tembo also called on the farmers to move from over-dependence
on the government to a position where the use of the resources
generate adequate returns.
</P>
<P>
"Our farmers must be helped to engage in agriculture as a
business. they must look at agriculture as an enterprise with
opportunity cost in terms of the usage of their labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC region is endowed with an adequate agricultural
resource base which, hitherto, has been largely under-utilized.
We need to mobilize resources to effectively tap this
agricultural resource base for the benefit of our people," Tembo
noted.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 percent of the total population of the SADC region
directly depends on agriculture for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The current forecasts (in June) suggest 16 million tons maize
will be available for this year, about a five percent decline
over 17 million tons last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regional production of all cereals combined amounts to 21.55
million tons, lower than last year's 22 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Energy Earnings Predicted to Drop 78 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Profits of Canada's 106 largest oil
and gas companies are predicted to plunge 78 percent this year,
said an industry study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Depressed crude oil prices are the main culprit behind the
pessimistic forecast by Calgary-based investment dealer
FirstEnergy Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the profits will probably fall to 500 million
Canadian dollars (340 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, from 2.25
billion Canadian dollars (1.53 billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The companies in the study were responsible for about 80
percent of Canada's daily conventional oil and gas output in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Martin Molyneaux, an analyst at FirstEnergy who headed the
comprehensive study, said the bright spot in the industry is
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
With natural gas prices hovering around 2.10 Canadian dollars
(1.43 U.S. dollars) for 1,000 cubic feet in Alberta, western
Canada, or 30 percent higher than a year ago, companies with large
gas reserves in their portfolio remain in good shape.
</P>
<P>
However, the 28-percent drop in oil prices, to 14.50
U.S. dollars a barrel over the past year, has slashed cash flow at
energy companies, hampering efforts by oil-dependent producers to
strengthen their natural gas drilling programs.
</P>
<P>
FirstEnergy forecasts in its survey that conventional oil and
liquids production among the companies will fall by 120,000
barrels a day, or about seven percent, to 1.63 million barrels a
day this year.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas production is expected to be 11.3 billion cubic
feet a day in 1998, matching last year's output.
</P>
<P>
FirstEnergy expects a rebound in oil prices in the second half
of the year, amounting to an average of 16.50 U.S. dollars for
1998.

<HEADLINE> German Unemployment Down 120,000 in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment dropped by
120,000, to 4.075 million in June, German Chancellery Minister
Friedrich Bohl said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, measured on the basis of
seasonally-unadjusted data, fell to 10.5 percent from 10.9 percent
registered in May, Bohl added.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by final data to be released by the German Federal
Labor Office next Tuesday, it would represent the fourth
consecutive drop in Germany's unemployment since March.
</P>
<P>
The decline in unemployment bears special significance for
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is geared up to campaign for a
record fifth term in the September 27 national elections.

<HEADLINE> Shipbreaking Thriving in Bangladesh's Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The shipbreaking industry operating
along Bangladesh's southeast coastal belt in Sitakundu has opened
up a potential economic front for the country, the Daily Star
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The industry earned the local government about 3 billion taka
(about 65.2 million U.S. dollars) annually, the Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of shops have sprung up on both sides of the
Chittagong-Dhaka highway near Sitakundu's shipbreaking yards,
selling goods from scrapper ships, the English newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The sector was brought by the local government under its tax
net only five years ago after taking real shape in early 1980. But
the business started in as early as 1960 when a foreign ship ran
aground in a cyclone and the crew put it up for auction after
failing to refloat it.
</P>
<P>
"Everything of a scrapped ship is utilized and nothing left
un-used," sources of the Shipbreakers Association were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The rerolling mills in Bangladesh now get 90 percent of their
raw materials from ship-scraps, thus reducing the dependence on
imported billets.
</P>
<P>
The furniture, sanitary facilities, electrical equipment,
fuels, engines, generators, motors and cables from broken ships
are re-used, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Since shipbreaking is a labor-intensive industry as everything
is done manually, about 1 million people including 300,000
laborers are involved directly or indirectly in the business
thriving over a 20-kilometer-long coastal belt.
</P>
<P>
Costs of imported ships for scrapping range from 100 to 700
million taka (about 2.17-14.98 million dollars) for each one.
</P>
<P>
As the price of scrapped ships has dropped on the international
market to below 175 dollars per ton against 190-261 dollars per
ton earlier, shipbreakers can make more profit.
</P>
<P>
However, modern technologies for breaking the ships, equipping
the yards with floating cranes, barges and dockyards, have yet to
be introduced in Bangladesh, they said, urging the government to
come forward to develop the industry.

<HEADLINE> Bierhoff Wary of Croatian Vengeance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- German striker Olivier Bierhoff has
warned that Germany should be wary of a stronger Croatia team
attempting to seek revenge in Saturday's World Cup quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
"This match is vengeance for the 1996 European championship for
Croatia. We'll have to be psychologicaly strong," said Bierhoff in
Nice on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Croatia lost to Germany 2-1 in Manchester during that championship
after defender Igor Stimac was sent off.
</P>
<P>
"I know that the Croatia team has a similiar style of play to
Yugoslavia, who we've already played, but they are tougher and more
focused," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff, who has signed AC Milan from Italian side Udinese, said
he would prove that he scored not simply because of good luck.
</P>
<P>
"Up until now, they used to say my success was just due to good
luck, but over the past two years, I've proven otherwise," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Bierhoff, who scored three goals in the tournament so far, said
his status in the team has changed in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"In the European championships, despite the goals I scored, I
wasn't really counted upon. In the World Cup here, it's very nice to
have the confidence of the whole team."

government to discuss the issues of how to ensure security and
expand cooperation in Central Asia and the entire Asian continent.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Limit Domestic Borrowings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will limit
its remaining domestic borrowings this year to a maximum of 30
billion pesos (750 million U.S. dollars), Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The revised domestic borrowing level is about 25 percent of the
government's earlier committed borrowings for the remainder of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu explained that the reduction is intended to bring down
interest rates which in the past two weeks have been going up
following market perception that government needs to borrow more
funds from the private sector to finance its budgetary deficit.
</P>
<P>
As of May this year, the government posted a budget deficit of
15.4 billion pesos (385 million dollars). The government is
expected to incur a total of nearly 40 billion pesos (1 billion
dollars) in its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Because of low revenue collection, the government has been
forced to source funds from the private sector through the
issuance of government securities, specifically the short-term
Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
Under the present borrowing program, the government is
scheduled to borrow at least 24 billion pesos (600 million
dollars) a month alone.
</P>
<P>
But aside from reducing its domestic borrowings, Espiritu said
the government is studying the possibility of granting a new round
of tax amnesty to boost government collection.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Draw Old-age Pensions from Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 120,000 retired workers from
state-owned enterprises in this capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province will receive a deposit book starting today.
</P>
<P>
With the bank book, retirees can draw their old-age pensions
from any savings outlet in the city of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank or the China Construction Bank.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of bank books means that the issuance of
old-age pensions has become more socialized, a city government
official said.
</P>
<P>
Without an adequate social guarantee system, the issuance of
old-age pensions in China's state-owned enterprises usually
depended on the well-being of the enterprises for which the
retirees had worked.
</P>
<P>
As a result, pension payments were frequently delayed,
threatening the normal life of the retired people.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, Chengdu began entrusting banks to issue
old-age pensions directly to the retirees starting this month. By
the end of this year, some 180,000 retired people will be able to
draw their old-age pensions directly from banks.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be worried about a retired life without a pension
guarantee. Now, we feel reassured," said Liu Shaoquan, one of
the 473 retirees who received deposit books today.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's main opposition
leader Sam Rainsy Friday appealed to the armed forces, police and
security forces to remain neutral during and after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, president of the Sam Rainsy Party, urged these
forces not to side with any party.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to help preserve peace and freedom for the
Cambodian people and to avoid using violence against people, or
following illegal orders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the former finance minister said if the election
results were certified as free and fair by the international
community, he hoped the forces would be ready to defend the new
government by all legal means if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government will mobilize a force of about 80,000
to ensure the security of the elections scheduled for July 28.
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts see the elections as just a three-way
contest between Sam Rainsy, who founded his own political party in
1995, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen.

Tacconi said Italy had an upper hand in attacking with the likes of
Roberto Baggio, Alessandro Del Piero and Christian Vieri.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Italy have a very strong attack and should be looking to
score a goal against what is probably the best denfence in this World

Heading a trade mission of the British water industry and 10
leading UK aerospace companies, the visiting British leader today

</P>
<P>
Zhao Baojiang, China's vice-minister of construction, stressed
at the seminar that China will make positive use of foreign

China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yuli, president of the Aviation Industry of China, said at

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has made unprecedented achievements in its fight
against illegal drugs in recent years, according to local police.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the autonomous region spent more than 30 million yuan
setting up 63 compulsory rehabilitation centers, in which more
than 20,000 drug addicts received treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police sources also disclosed that, in 1997, 4,000
rehabilitated drug-abusers who resumed their addiction were sent
to rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
Situated not far from the notorious "Golden Triangle," the
autonomous region has suffered enormously from the international
drug trade which uses the region as a transfer station.
</P>
<P>
In a counterattack, the autonomous region's police have
intensified their anti-drug efforts in recent year, vowing to
transform the autonomous region into a "no-drug region."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that police cracked 9,728 drug cases in 1997,
detaining 12,464 drug dealers and seizing 368.46 kilograms of
drugs.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Warned for Renewed Military Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Venancio de Moura, the Angolan
Foreign Minister, has warned the opposition force for renewed
military actions against the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol, saying
that the government would not remained "indifferent".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Madrid Wednesday on his way back home after his
mediation effort in Guinea Bissau, Moura said that the Angolan
government would not bear to see the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) recapture cities and towns they
had handed over to the government, neither would the government
bear to to see UNITA continue lay mines on roads and land that
had been cleared of the vital explosives.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has not yet the intention to have
the armed forces involved in the unrest, but the national police
force have been ordered to strike back on the UNITA military
remnants and other criminal forces if needed.
</P>
<P>
The minister also asked UN member countries, especially those
where UNITA has opened bank accounts and with those UNITA had
diamond trade to observe the sanctions the UN has imposed on
UNITA.
</P>
<P>
UNITA earns from diamond exportation about 500 million U.S.
Dollars each year, which Moura said, had neither been used for
the country's development nor deposited in Angola's banks.
</P>
<P>
He said some neighbors of Angola have been used for UNITA's
arms and diamond trade, though their governments might not be
involved.
</P>
<P>
Moura said that he was pessimistic about the situation in
Angola, adding that though dialogues have been taken as priority
in solving the crisis, there still exists the possibility of
a renewed war.

<TEXT>
<P>

Thursday of the new Hong Kong International Airport by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin is of special significance as it will inject
new vitality into Hong Kong by boosting the people's confidence,
newspapers here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, a multi-billion-dollar project completed after
eight years' construction, is located on a 1,248-hectare reclaimed
site at Chek Lap Kok off the northern coast of Lantau Island, 25
kilometers west of the Hong Kong Island. Operating around the
clock, the airport has a designed capacity of handling 35 million
passengers and 3 million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's appearance at and opening of the new airport
demonstrated the central government's firm support for Hong Kong's
major infrastructure projects and its efforts to promote economic
development, said an editorial of Chinese-language newspaper Wen
Wei Po.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang also brought the good wishes of the people in
the motherland to the Hong Kong people who are making efforts to
further promote business and trade through worldwide cooperation,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The new international airport, one of the most advanced
airports in the world today, will help guarantee that Hong Kong
remains the most prosperous international center for
transportation, trade, finance and tourism with broadest
international links, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
On the historic day on Thursday, President Jiang's special
plane was the first aircraft to take off from the airport after
its official opening while several hours later, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's special plane became the first aircraft to land at
the very same airport, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the new airport amid the Southeast Asian
financial turmoil will encourage Hong Kong people to forge ahead
in this difficult time, help each other and aim high for more
achievements," it added.
</P>
<P>
"New Airport Injects Vitality Into Hong Kong for a New
Takeoff," reads the title of a Friday editorial of the local
newspaper Hong Kong Commercial Daily.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new airport by President Jiang before his
departure from Hong Kong and the beginning of its commercial
operation will greatly increase Hong Kong's exchanges with China's
mainland and countries and regions in other parts of the world,
the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"The new airport will inject new vitality into Hong Kong's
economic development and help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an
international and regional center of finance, trade, aviation and
tourism and enhance its competitiveness in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Working as one through concerted efforts, Hong Kong residents
can certainly overcome temporary difficulties and achieve a new
economic takeoff," the newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Issues White Paper on Foreign Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade and economic
cooperation activities will face severe challenges this year
despite the monumental achievements recorded in 1997, according to
the 1998 White Paper recently issued by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The White Paper points to lingering domestic and international
difficulties from past few years, and notes that the impact of the
Asian financial crisis should under no account be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
China's 1998 exports to major trade partners, including members
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Japan, will face even greater
difficulties, the document predicts, while the competitiveness of
Chinese export commodities will decline and China's use of foreign
investments will fall.
</P>
<P>
It also says China will follow the evolution of the financial
crisis in a bid to find and use any opportunities surrounding the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, The White Paper reviews the growth of China's foreign
trade and economic cooperation in 1997, as well as the economic
and trade development worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The role China's foreign trade and economic cooperation played
in terms of the national economy was further strengthened during
1997, and China was for the first time included on the list of the
world's top ten trading nations, according to the document.

China's major achievements included an 8.47 percent rise in the
use of foreign investment to 45.26 billion US dollars; steady
progress concerning the reform on the form of providing foreign
trade and the work in this regard, marked results in foreign
economic cooperation; new progress in implementing the diversified
market strategy and reform of the foreign trade system; and the
continuous development of both multilateral and bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The global economy grew rapidly by 4.1 percent during 1997,
according to the document. It also predicted that the global
economy will continue to grow during 1998, although anticipated
3.5 percent growth will be the lowest since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The global economic increase rate will slow dramatically, and
the Asian financial crisis will have a definite impact on the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 1998 increase rate for international trade
will drop, and the growth rate for the global trade volume is
expected to fall by some two to three percent on the 1997 figure,
according to the White Paper.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it acknowledges that the trade imbalance will
intensify competition amongst traders.

TAIYUAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Shasha, China's oldest female giant
panda, died yesterday in the Taiyuan Zoo at age 33 from heart
failure and cerebral blockage.
</P>
<P>
Shasha, one of the few giant pandas to live past age 25,
suffered from heart failure and stopped breathing during the night
on June 29. Veterinarians immediately administered emergency
medical procedures to restart her heart.
</P>
<P>
Local veterinarians and zookeepers used state-of-the-art
equipment and rendered constant care over the ensuring four days
to save Shasha.
</P>
<P>
However, one veterinarian noted that prolonging the panda's
life using existing medical procedures was impossible due to
Shasha's age and medical condition.
</P>
<P>
A zoo doctor said that Shasha was suffering from epilepsy and
cataracts resulting from her advanced age.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures soaring to 37 degrees Celsius on the night
Shasha collapsed further complicated the problem.
</P>
<P>
Shasha never regained consciousness, with only medicines and
oxygen prolonging her life for four days.
</P>
<P>
The zoo plans to complete taxidermy procedures and place
Shasha's body on display.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Blames Palestinians for Gaza Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Friday accused the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
of "deliberate provocation" in the standoff between Israeli and
Palestinian troops in Gaza Strip Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a regular briefing to foreign
diplomats on the political situation, Netanyahu described the
Palestinian blockade of a coastal road and several Jewish
settlements as a " major violation" of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
He slammed a senior PNA official for attempting to challenge
the Israeli rights over security mandated in the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to PNA Minister of Supplies Abdul
Aziz Shahin, who led the Palestinians in the 12-hour standoff
that ended early Friday morning following intensive mediating
efforts involving American and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
During the dispute over the use of a coastal road, Israeli and
Palestinian troops scuffled and shouted with each other, and even
took key positions where they pointed guns at one another.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst standoff between Israeli and Palestinian
troops since September 1996, when they clashed in a temporary
armed conflict sparked by Israel's opening of an underground
tunnel in the Old City of East Jerusalem. Over 70 people were
killed in the 1996 confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu vowed that Israel would never give up its rights on
security and would not allow the use or threat of use of
violence. "Nothing will be achieved by violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest incident was another sign of the PNA's
refusal to honor their commitments, including the collection of
illegal weapons, arrest of terrorists, halt to hostile propaganda,
and revision of the Palestinian Covenant calling for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
To move forward the peace process, the Palestinians must keep
their commitments and resolve their differences with Israel
peacefully, Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line leader once against blamed the PNA for the long
deadlock in the peace process. He said "some progress" on the
sticking point of Israeli next troop pullback in the West Bank had
been achieved, but the "persistent refusal" by the Palestinians to
fulfill their obligations prevented an overdue agreement.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's standoff came at a time when tension is mounting
between the two sides due to the long impasse over the second
pullback, the recent Israeli decision to expand the boundaries of
Jerusalem, as well as the PNA efforts to upgrade its status in the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa: No Final Decision on Ties With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is now in the
process of a decision regarding the establishment of diplomatic
relations with Iraq, South African Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Marco Boni told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said in a telephone interview that South Africa is looking
for ways and modalities of such a move, adding: "There is no
final decision."
</P>
<P>
Boni said his country should normalize relations with
countries like Iraq under the context that South Africa will soon
take over the chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
But he refused to speculate whether the two countries would be
able to establish diplomatic ties before this year's NAM summit,
which will be held between August 29 and September 3 in Durban,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Boni said South Africa is also considering diplomatic ties
with seven other countries including the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
These countries are all members of the United Nations as South
Africa is, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to South African opposition parties' attack on the
government's approach to Iraq, Boni said: "They have narrow views
of South Africa's international responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of formal relations with countries
where South Africa was previously not represented would offer
opportunities for South Africa to have consular and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Boni also shrugged off opposition parties's criticism that the
forging of ties with Iraq was ill-timed as South Africa is
shutting down embassies worldwide owing to budget constraint.
</P>
<P>
"To Establish diplomatic relations does not mean opening an
embassy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of formal relations would allow South Africa
to deal at official level consular, economic and legal issues, he
explained.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Open Chinese-Built Stadium in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela is to open a Chinese-built stadium located at Namboole,
10 km east of the Ugandan capital of Kampala on January 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Eriya Kategaya, the Ugandan First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs, said this while meeting with Chinese
Ambassador to Uganda Song Zengshou here Thursday, the New Vision
daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the stadium, built by a Chinese construction firm,
COMPLANT, was handed over to the Ugandan authorities on February
28, 1997 and many football matches as well as some concerts have
been held in this largest stadium in Uganda since.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said the date of the ceremony was chosen
to coincide with the National Resistance Movement Day and it will
be presided over by Mandela who retires from presidency in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
The 40,202-seat complex, whose construction work began in
1992, cost as much as 30 billion Uganda Shillings or 30 million
U.S. Dollars. The money was a soft loan from the Chinese
government.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Says U.N. Human Rights Charges Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Friday dismissed as
groundless the human rights violation charges made by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR).
</P>
<P>
"The statement of the high commissioner criticizing Ethiopia
for human rights violations against Eritrean nationals is not only
absolutely groundless but is also of the kind that would undermine
the credibility of the office of the high commissioner," said the
Ethiopia's permanent mission to the U.N. Office in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The high commissioner cannot be uninformed of the fact that,
unlike the Eritrean government's treatment of Ethiopians in
Eritrea, whatever the Ethiopian government has been doing with
respect to Eritrean nationals in Ethiopia has been strictly within
the law and in full compliance with principles of international
humanitarian law and with full cognizance and respect of the
provisions of international treaties in the area of human rights,"
the mission said.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, UNHCHR chief Mary Robinson said, "I am deeply
concerned with the violation of human rights of Eritrean nationals
being expelled from Ethiopia, and particularly by the fact that
their passports are being stamped 'expelled, never to return'."
</P>
<P>
She noted at the same time that others who had been trying to
leave have had their identity cards confiscated.
</P>
<P>
"These are serious violations of the rights and freedoms set
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as in
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which
Ethiopia is a party," she added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cuts External Debt by $43 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external debt was reduced
by about 43.45 million U.S. Dollars in the first half of this
year, the national newspaper This Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the payment was effected through the
debt conversion program established by the government 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount was plowed back into the Nigerian economy
by way of investment in equities of various companies in
different sectors.
</P>
<P>
The cash gifts and grants sub-sector was the leading
beneficiary of such investment in the January-June period when it
attracted 18.28 million Dollars, accounting for 42.8 percent of
the total funds injected into the economy.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the manufacturing sub-sector with an
investment of 9.75 million Dollars, the exploration and mining
sub-sector with 7.04 million Dollars, and the hotel and tourism
sub-sector with 3.68 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting a study credited to Bankque National de
Paris Eastern European Investment Banking Group, revealed that
Nigeria's foreign debt stands at about 37 billion Dollars and has
been a significant setback to economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club of creditors accounts for two-thirds of the
total debt in which five billion is projected for servicing
yearly.
</P>
<P>
It was for the purpose of reducing the debt burden that the
Nigerian government launched the debt conversion program in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Between November that year and June this year, 378 investment
applications were successful in converting 799.54 million Dollars
into equity participation in Nigerian companies.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Asks for IMF Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia government has appealed
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Zambia exploit
the highly indebted poor countries (Hipc) initiative to reduce
its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted acting Finance Minister Alfeyo
Hambayi as saying Thursday here when he received visiting IMF
officials that Zambia needs the Hipc initiative as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current arrangements, Zambia will not qualify for
accessing the Hipc benefits until at least three full years under
the country's enhanced structural adjustment facility (Esaf) have
been completed.
</P>
<P>
"This will take us until the end of 1999. Zambia cannot wait
that long to see the burden of its external indebtedness reduced
to manageable levels," said Hambayi.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the IMF to judge the performance of Zambia by
its policy direction rather than isolated incidents, adding that
the support of the IMF is vital to the implementation of the
economic reform program in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, whose foreign debt now has exceeded 7 billion U.S.
Dollars, has to set aside 60 percent of its foreign exchange
earnings to serve the unsustainable debt.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drifts Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar drifted a
little lower Friday for a lack of firm news from Japan on
decisions to reform its faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended the session slightly weaker but off
earlier lows at 61.72 U.S. cents from 61.79 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan Thursday night unveiled a vast rescue scheme to tackle
its huge bad bank loans, bowing to international pressure to
revive the world's second largest economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bridge bank system insolvent banks will be taken
over and their mountain of bad loans cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Blythe said he
expected the outlook for the Japanese economy and financial reform
would continue to hold center stage over the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said the
Australian dollar was likely to be mired between 0.6000 and 0.6300
U.S. dollar over coming months.
</P>
<P>
"Asia will face a long, grinding recovery with pot-holes along
the road while the recent rally in commodity prices is
unconvincing," James said.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 85.94
Japanese yen from 85.92 and 1.1213 German marks from 1.1243.

<HEADLINE> Global Semiconductor Sales Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The global semiconductor sales
dropped by 12.7 percent in May as compared with the same period of
last year, said the California-based Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sales totaled 9.99 billion U.S. dollars, down from 11.46
billion dollars in May of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The May numbers reflect the recent announcements from several
leading semiconductor companies," the SIA said.
</P>
<P>
"The semiconductor industry is still responding to the effects
of the slowdown of the Asian economies," it added.
</P>
<P>
The decline touched all four marketing regions -- the Americas,
Europe, Japan and the Asia-Pacific region -- with Japan and the
Americas falling by 19 and 17 percent, respectively, on a
year-by-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Oversupply which continues to depress prices adds up to the
Asian factor. Unit sales are actually climbing, but price cuts are
moving faster, leading to falling revenues.
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly acute in memory, the core chips
used in computers. Memory prices for the desktop standard
16-megabit chip have fallen some 90 percent in the past three
years, to the point where prices are at or below the cost of
manufacture, some industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Another serious problem for chipmaking companies has been the
PC market's move toward lower cost machines, which has slashed the
average selling price of chips.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, chip industry leaders confronting slowing
sales had predicted a rebound by mid-1998. But the recovery did
not come true.
</P>
<P>
The financial services firm Merril Lynch &AMP; Co. now projects
that semiconductor sales will be down between five percent to 10
percent for the year, after originally forecasting that 1998 would
be flat.

SINGAPORE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices closed lower Friday
on Singapore Stock Market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) slipped by 2.20 points to close at
1,122.67 points, a strong contrast to the sharp rising in the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
The total volume shrank to 106.49 million shares, valued at
197.58 million Singapore dollars (about 116.91 million U.S.
dollars). The total of gainers dropped to 69 from Thursday's 169.
The number of losers rose to 180 from 110 a day earlier while 340
stocks remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBF Land was the most active stock with 17.05 million shares
traded. It was followed by MBF Cap which had 8.04 million units
done. DBS Land was next with 7.06 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Rothmans M topped the gainers of the day, up 30 cents to 11.70
Singapore dollars at close. Thai PR gained 23 cents to finish at
3.02 U.S. dollars. SPH rose by 20 cents to end at 12.90 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creativ 50 was the biggest loser as it lost 50
cents to finish at 21.60 Singapore dollars. Parkway was down 36
cents to end at 3.00 Singapore dollars. Shangri was next as it
shed 31 cents to close at 1.89 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said shares fell early but news of permanent tax cuts
in Japan caused a recovery before the midday break. Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was quoted as saying that he wanted
permanent income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
But share prices ended lower, indicating the euphoria over a
potential Japanese tax cut was fading away. Investors soon
realized that the measure alone can not solve the many deep-seated
problems that has been plaguing Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said property counters finished mixed on profit-taking
while some blue chips attracted interests.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, smaller stocks continued to be shunned as
retail investors were absent.

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian coach Cesare Maldini played
down the threat from French playmaker Zinedine Zidane who will come
back from a two-match suspension.

midfeld places are still open.

Maldini will have to choose between Angelo Di Livio and

<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) - The State Development Bank (SDB) has
pledged to further intensify credit support for infrastructure
and shorten the assessment process for related projects to
stimulate the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the bank will support a number of
infrastructure projects during 1998. The SDB has already
approved 121 projects and pledged to grant a total of 42.3
billion yuan in related loans.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia has had a negative
impact on China's export sector which has long been a major
contributor to the national economy. Therefore, the Chinese
government has decided to increase inputs for fixed assets such as
infrastructure to ensure fulfillment of this year's economic
growth rate of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank, a state policy-oriented bank established to support
infrastructure and basic industries, has set this year's credit
line at 122.8 billion yuan, up 11.6 percent on last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also place top priority on railway, highway,
telecommunications, water conservancy, power generation,
environmental protection and urban construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also pledged to simplify the assessment process
and ensure the early placement of funds for projects with a high
return potential.

<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French supreme court the Cour de Cassation Thursday said
that the 1985 contamination of blood stocks by AIDS would not make
up a crime of poisoning, and thus allow three key members of the
government at that time, including former Prime Minister Laurent
Fabius, who is now National Assembly president, to avoid a trial by
court over the disaster. The court said that a crime of poisoning
must be accompanied with an intention to kill.
</P>
<P>
-- Three years and a half after it joined the European Union,
Austria formally took over the rotating chairmanship of EU from
July 1. However, Vienna's term of chairmanship is overshadowed by
a major event for EU during its presidency -- the German general
elections in September, which is expected to produce a new German
government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Thursday
that the growth rate this year in France will be around 3 percent,
close to the 3.2 percent predicted by the official statistics
bureau INSEE. Strauss-Kahn made the statement when presenting the
economic balance sheet for the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Academy Thursday for the first time in history
decided to let the General Commission of Terminology and Neologism
to decide whether to feminize some names in the French language. The
French Academy in the past had always been the advisor for the
government in the field of language.

HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said

Speaking at a press conference held at Grand Hyatt Hotel,
Clinton urged the Japanese government to truly implement its

"I don't think any one seriously believes that financial
situation in Asia can get better... unless Japan can grow again,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the Japanese economy is vital to the resumption
of the global growth, said the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Again, he praised China's efforts not to devalue the RBM yuan,
saying: "I will reiterate that China has done a good thing by
maintaining the stability of their currency, and is not engaged in
the competitive devaluation."

The Report notes that China faces enormous challenges related
to human development. It also points out that growing
unemployment, rising social and economic inequality, the absence
of a social security system able to cope with changing conditions,
the unequal burden on women due to social changes, and the growing
destruction of China's natural environment are amongst the most
serious threats.

challenges and enter the new century as a model for both rapid
economic growth and human development which promotes the
well-being of all people and the natural balance of the earth.

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- France's gross domestic product (GDP)
is expected to grow at 3.2 percent in 1998, said the official
economic and statistics bureau INSEE on Friday.
</P>

<P>
It predicts that the country's unemployment rate will be
lowered to around 11.5 percent by the end of this year, as is

banking interest rates for lending credits to enterprises are
maintained at a low level.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Red Colobus monkeys, a major
tourist attraction in the isles of Zanzibar, have damaged
agricultural crops and forced the government to compensate
farmers.
</P>
<P>
So far, Zanzibar Agriculture, Livestock and Natural Resources
Ministry has compensated villagers around the Jozani Forest 1.5
million Shillings (about 2,250 U.S. Dollars) for the crops
damaged by the monkeys.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Daily News Friday, the deputy
agriculture minister, Mwalim Ameir, said the money spent on
compensation was part of profits accrued from tourist excursions
into the forest.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question by Haji Mkema, an MP from Koani, in the
House of Representatives in Zanzibar Thursday, Ameir said the
ministry has started taking measures to protect maize, cassava
and other crops.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the official maintained the need to preserve
the red Colobus monkeys, which attract large numbers of tourists.

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French team manager Aime Jacquet said
he feared the Italian team, their quarter-final opponents at the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"I fear Italy's realism, their thorough professionalism and
their ability to constantly adapt," said Jacquet, "I fear the
individual skills of each player and their great attacking
potential and also their characteristic ability to smother the
opposition."
</P>
<P>
But what Jacquet fears most about the Italian team is their
ability to counter-attack:"They move as one daunting block and
strike out with killer dagger thrusts. It is fatal to think that
Italy will sit back and defend." Jacquet said.
</P>
<P>
But Jacquet thinks his team still have the chance of beating the
Italian team:"Patience, optimism, and the excellence of those key
players that both teams possess will be decisive," said Jacquet,
"The team that can put these exceptional players in a position to
express themselves will win."

international community to stop the nuclear arms race in South

<P>
ALMA-ATA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
delivered a speech at the five-nation meeting of China,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan here Friday. The
full text reads as follows.
</P>
<P>
Respected Colleagues and Friends:
</P>
<P>
Today, we are glad to be here to discuss ways for further
promoting peace and stability and strengthening the economic
cooperation among our five nations and in this region. I believe
this meeting will be a full demonstration of our sincere will and
firm determination to promote the cause of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of safeguarding peace and stability in this
region, China and Russia signed and published a bilateral
agreement that reaffirmed our obligation not to be the first to
use nuclear weapons against each other and pronounced our decision
to stop targeting each other with our strategic nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Kazakhstan's move to destroy its nuclear
weapons and its position on joining the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty in the status of a nuclear-free nation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China solemnly pledged nuclear security assurance to
Kazakhstan and declared it would actively participate in the
process of "The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building
Measures in Asia", which was initiated by Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
China also supports the proposal, which was put forward by
Uzbekistan and supported by the countries in Central Asia, for the
establishment of a Central Asia Nuclear-Free Zone.
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to reiterate that China favors a
comprehensive ban and total destruction of nuclear weapons. And
unconditionally, China will never be the first to use nuclear
weapons against any country or any region. Moreover, under no
circumstances will China ever use, or threaten to use, nuclear
weapons against any nuclear-free country or any nuclear-free
zone. China has no intention to resume nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The achievements our five countries have made in safeguarding
regional peace and stability and in fostering the continuous
development of our mutual relations are the results of our efforts
to go with the tide of the times and uphold the principles of
mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Our common experience shows that only with mutual respect can
we live in harmony; only with equality and mutual benefit can we
develop our cooperation; and only when we uphold the principle of
solving the differences and disputes between countries by peaceful
means can we find effective ways for equitable and reasonable
solutions to our problems.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain and develop the friendly cooperation among
our five nations, we must continue to resolutely fight against
such public evils as national splittism, religious extremism,
terrorism, arms smuggling and drug trafficking, which are
threatening the stability and security of the countries in this
region. In this regard, there is a need for the diplomatic,
police, security, customs and other related departments of our
five countries to strengthen their consultation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China is deeply concerned about the tense situation in South
Asia, which is adjacent to Central Asia. China supports the joint
communique issued in Geneva recently by the five permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council and other relevant
resolutions of the Security Council. China is willing to work
together with the international community to stop the nuclear arms
race in South Asia, to ease the tension in that region and to
maintain peace and security in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan enjoy many
advantages in fostering their bilateral and multilateral economic,
trade and technological cooperation. China is willing to actively
develop the economic cooperation among our nations in light of the
principle of mutual benefit and efficiency. Here I suggest that we
start with developing our cooperation in the fields of trade,
transport, energy, metallurgy, light industry, textile industry
and agriculture, and encourage mutual investment and joint
production. China will continue to take an active part in the
construction of the Euro-Asia continental bridge and to provide
sea-borne transport facilities to the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Yet to Meet Key Demands for IMF Loans: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has still to try more to
fulfill two key conditions so that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) can start talks on resuming 205-million-U.S.-Dollar
aid package, the fund's representative Reimer Carstens has said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya needs to strengthen the independence of the
Anti-Corruption Authority and establish accountability for the
so-called Goldenberg export compensation case, he was quoted
Friday by the Kenya Times newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those two steps would need to be taken by mid-July if there is
to be any chance of an IMF mission coming in August or September,
and if there is any hope of a resumption of IMF aid this calendar
year, Carstens said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If they are taken, the country could be back on course for a
resumption of the aid loan, he said. The loan was halted on July
31 last year, causing a collapse of investors' confidence and a
sharp rise of interest rates in this east African state.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming these two governance issues, called prior actions,
are accomplished, given the presentation of a courageous budget,
one could say the future cooperation between the fund and Kenya
could be on course very soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a tough budget speech at parliament on June 11, Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae said he aimed to bring the interest rates
down by slashing public spending and to curb mounting budget
deficits in this fiscal year starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
Kenya ran a budget deficit of 2.7 percent of gross domestic
product in the 1997/98 fiscal year, with domestic borrowing
pushing interest rates up very high.
</P>
<P>
Carstens said government sources had told him that work on
fulfilling the two conditions was "well advanced."
</P>
<P>
But if the conditions are not fulfilled this month, a visit
would be delayed until after the annual IMF/World Bank meeting in
October, and any resumption of IMF lending would not be possible
until the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Evangelos Calamitsis, head of the IMF's
African Department, said in Washington that it would be tight to
resume lending in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Kamlesh Pattni, his Goldenberg company and three
former senior government officials have pleaded not guilty to
charges of stealing billions of Shillings from Kenya's Treasury
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Last week, John Harum Mwau, the chief of the Anti-Corruption
Authority set up last year, brought his first case to court,
charging Nairobi City Council officials with defrauding millions
of Kenyan Shillings from City Hall.

</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed," Boeing spokeswoman Liz Verdier said, "We
offered what we thought would be the best airplane for their
marketing requirements."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Airways chose the Airbus A330 over
Boeing's 767-400 for the carrier's trans-Atlantic routes. The
initial order is for seven A330s, with seven orders to be
reconfirmed and 16 further options in view.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the second major contract between U.S. Airways and
Airbus -- the former signed an agreement with the latter in 1996
for up to 400 of the smaller A320 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts believe that Thursday's deal underlines the
growing strength of Airbus, which said it won 52 percent of all
firm global commercial airline orders in the first half of 1998 --
the best showing in its 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has suffered a rash of problems in recent months,
culminating in a monthlong shutdown on two assembly lines last
October to clear bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Boeing has been badly hit by the Asian crisis,
with airlines in the region struggling to find financing for new
jets.
</P>
<P>
Airbus, by contrast, has hardly been touched by the slump in
Asia orders because many of its best customers operate in Europe.

<P>
NANTES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Brian Laudrup said what he
would do in their quarterfinal against Brazil is to take full
advantage of the holes in the Brazilian defence.
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a key area, especially for myself," he said
Thursday night. "Cafu and Roberto Carlos try to go forward and that
will leave some space behind them. Those are the areas I'll try to
exploit."
</P>
<P>
He added: "They are human beings like ourselves. I don't think
we've seen a brillant Brazilian team yet."
</P>
<P>
Laudrup said Brazil's performance against Scotland and Norway was
not as good as the Danes expected and that encouraged the whole team.
</P>
<P>
"We are physically and tactically very strong. Most of our players
play in European leagues and are very professional," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow Rangers forward continued: "We are here to entertain
the crowd...But the most important thing is to entertain the crowd but
to be successful as well. We will certainly try and go for goal
against Brazil."

<P>
NANTES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian midfielder Rivaldo rejected
criticism that he was greedy on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Rivaldo, who has been given the job of creating chances for
superstar Ronaldo, has been criticized for hanging on to the ball for
too long and therefore restricted Ronaldo to a modest performance in
the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo has scored only three goals in four matches, far below
the expectation.
</P>
<P>
But Rivaldo would not accept the criticism:"Man, I get
criticized for this but I don't hang on to the ball so much."
</P>
<P>
"I watch tapes of games where I have been criticized and
frankly, I don't find the criticism justified," said Rivaldo, "There
are times when we have the game in our hands when it is better to
keep possession for a while. But when I see a player making a run,
then I pass it straight away."

<HEADLINE> Tick Diseases Threaten Cattle in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 800 cases of various
tick-related diseases have been reported in Zimbabwe since
January this year, endangering the health of thousands of cattle,
the Department of Veterinary Services said.
</P>
<P>
The loss of cattle through tick-related diseases poses a
serious threat to efforts by farmers to rebuild the national
herd.
</P>
<P>
While great strides have been made to control the diseases,
the problem is compounded by the fact that most farmers are
unable to recognize and treat the diseases themselves, the
department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many more cattle may die if communal, small-holder and
commercial farmers do not vaccinate their cattle.
</P>
<P>
Welbourne Madzima, deputy director of the Department of
Veterinary Services, told the Daily Herald that efforts were
underway to sensitize farmers on the need to vaccinate their
livestock against the diseases.
</P>
<P>
Trends indicated that headwater would eventually cover the
entire country as the disease was spreading to the higher
rainfall areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The department wants farmers to take precautionary measures by
vaccinating their livestock against tick-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
The disease affects lungs causing difficulty in breathing
while red water and gall sickness caused loss of blood in
breasts.

<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite the sending off of David
Beckham and the elimination in the second round, England still take
the lead in FIFA Fair Play Award contest.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the FIFA Fair Play Award is awarded to the team
with the best record of fair play according to a points system and
criteria extablished by the FIFA Fair Play Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 World Cup finals, the Brazilian team, which
eventually won the World Cup, also won the Fair Play award. That
was their third Fair Play trophy since the award was inaugurated in
1978.
</P>
<P>
Only teams that play at least four matches of the World Cup
finals are eligible to win the award. The overall assessment of a
team during the final competition is calculated by adding the points
attained at each match and dividing this figure by the number of
matches played.
</P>
<P>
England lead the list with 3,311 points, followed by Norway in
the second place at 3,286. Brazil are third with 3,285 points.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Determined to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has outlined several tendencies for corruption and reiterated the
government's determination to fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a recent meeting with opinion leaders
at the State House, the Monitor paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president said corruption could be promoted by four
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
The first is that the head of state is corrupt himself; and
the second is when the president's subordinates are corrupt, he
is afraid of purging them.
</P>
<P>
The third is that the president may not be corrupt but his
investigators fail to perform their duties; and the last is that
the state attorneys make case files disappear so that the
magistrates and judges have to dismiss the cases due to lack of
solid evidence, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Investigation, prosecution and judgement are very vital
especially when you are following the law," Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
He holds that the easiest way to get rid of corruption is
political, calling on local leaders and members of parliament to
spearhead the anti-corruption crusade.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Ready to Meet Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda has said he is ready to meet President Frederick Chiluba
to discuss matters of national development if he is invited.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview here Thursday Kaunda told Times of
Zambia that he has decided to quit party politics to concentrate
on matters affecting the country and he has always been willing
to meet Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
But he said his decision to quit party politics will not mean
that he will not criticize the government or his own party.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has called for a central committee meeting of his
United National Independence Party (UNIP) to explain his reasons
for quitting party politics.
</P>
<P>
"I will criticize either UNIP or MMD (the ruling party) if
they do wrong things and I shall praise government when they do
something good," Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled fears that UNIP will fold up after his planned
retirement, saying UNIP is not KK (meaning Kaunda himself) and KK
is not UNIP and as such the party should continue with or without
him.
</P>
<P>
"This same KK will one day die. What will happen if i die? "
he asked.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was freed from under house arrest early last month
after the state entered a nolle prosequi.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- After just over half a year, the
Nanning-Kunming Railway, which runs from the capital of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to Yunnan Province via Guizhou
Province in southwestern China, has begun to have an effect on
local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The 898-kilometer electrified railway line cost more than 10
billion yuan. It opened to traffic last November and has moved 3
million tons of cargo by now, including phosphorus from Yunnan,
coal from Guizhou, and aluminum from Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The three areas still have more than 10 million poor people, or
approximately a quarter of China's total number, and the railway
was built with the intention of helping the needy.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou's nine counties and cities along the line have 12.1
billion tons of anthracite. The county of Xingren is expected
to produce a million tons of coal this year. Already it has helped
to bring a 47 percent increase in local revenues in the first four
months of this year, and the county's deputy magistrate, Zhou
Yuren, says that the railway has made it possible for the coal
industry to make a real economic contribution.
</P>
<P>
Convenient transportation has also encouraged local farmers to
grow more fruits and other cash crops. One prefecture of Guangxi,
for example, is estimated to produce 40 million kilograms of
mangoes this summer, a 25 percent increase over last year.

MAPUTO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Graca Machel, wife of Mozambique's

NANCHANG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nanchang section on China's
north-south railway trunk from Beijing to Kowloon in Hong Kong has
resumed operation after suspension for three days.
</P>
<P>
The bed of the railway sank and bent the tracks when it was
struck by flood waters on June 29, causing a 600-mm gap in the
railway track near the provincial capital city of Nanchang that a
train was using. But the cars were disconnected and four were
pulled to the North Nanchang Station and the others to the West
Nanchang Station and a serious accident that would be caused by
floods was avoided.
</P>
<P>
A engineering team of 950 people was rushed to scene and the
line to Beijing was able to reopen on the evening of June 30,
although speed was held to 5 kilometers per hour. The other track
opened to traffic the evening of July 2 and 20 passenger trains
that were stranded in water have all left for their respective
destinations.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the railway line between Yingtan city
in Jiangxi Province and the Xiamen Special Economic Zone in Fujian
reopened to traffic today after half a month of being closed as a
result of heavy flooding. And Cargo trains and some passenger

<HEADLINE> ADB Predicts Strong Growth for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
has predicted that a strong and sustainable economic growth will
be realized by Nigeria, citing the country's rich resources and
efforts to diversify the economy.
</P>
<P>
The current efforts of Nigeria to develop agriculture and
natural gas are a testimony, the bank noted in its 1998 "African
Development Report", the Guardian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The development of natural gas projects will gradually reduce
the economy's dependence on crude oil revenue," the bank report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The economy can also gain further strength with developments
in the agricultural sector, which has tremendous potentials for
productivity improvement," it added.
</P>
<P>
Given these, the ADB expects the real gross domestic product
(GDP) of Nigeria to grow by four to five percent in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
The ADB report, however, does not give much hope on
manufacturing, saying that at least in the short term the
petroleum and agriculture sectors would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
On conditions to realize the prediction, the report said, "the
growth outlook is contingent upon oil prices and favorable
climate conditions. Inflation is expected to continue the
declining trend over the forecast horizon, but market
intervention by the Central Bank is unlikely to prevent any
weakening of the Naira."
</P>
<P>
The bank projected Nigeria's inflation at 20 to 26 percent
range in the medium term, compared to its current single digit
level.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's real GDP grew at an average rate of five percent
during the 1987-1992 period, reflecting a slight improvement in
agriculture and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, as oil price declined in 1993 amid political
uncertainties, the economy sank into a recession with real output
posting a mere 1.02 percent growth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, real GDP growth rates have improved because of
higher oil prices. The regional apex multilateral institution
estimated Nigeria GDP growth rate for 1997 at 3.2 percent, which
is lower than the government figure of 3.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has since 1994 been pursuing the goal
of macro-economic stability as a basis for accelerating the pace
of economic recovery and promoting sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
In its current program of recovery, greater attention is paid
to trade liberalization, economic diversification and the
adoption of a relatively free foreign exchange system with guided
deregulation as a major policy framework.

community did not seem to demonstrate the required urgency in
dealing with the issue.

<P>
According to UNAIDS, Zimbabwe and Botswana are leading the
world with one in every four adults estimated to be infected by
HIV, while nearly 15 years after the first AIDS case was
identified in Zimbabwe, an estimated 1.5 million people have
contracted HIV and more than 350,000 of these have developed full
blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"With so many people with HIV infection and affected by AIDS,
prevention interventions alone are not adequate. There is an
urgent need to strengthen focus on AIDS care, support and impact
alleviation strategies.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has to be addressed with a clear understanding and
appreciation that it intermingles the issues of inequality,
poverty, culture and sexuality in complex ways," Marowa said.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the seminar noted that there was an urgent
need for clear government policy compelling the private sector to
establish a constructive policy for AIDS prevention program.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inflation Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's inflation rate has risen
to 25.7 percent while the base lending interest rate in
commercial banks is also up, standing at 28.5 percent as the
country's economy continues to slide.
</P>
<P>
The fornight statistics of the central bank, the Bank of
Zambia shows that the degenerating macro-economic indicators have
been compounded by the continued reduction of gross international
reserves, which have dropped to 155 million U.S. Dollars from 255
million Dollars of last September.
</P>
<P>
No foreign exchange inflows have come to the central bank from
either the donor community or the Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) since Feburary, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The projected inflation rate of nine percent for this year has
suffered a setback with the high inflation rate of 25.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the country's currency has continued to
be low with Kwacha at 1,952 against one Dolloar compared with
1,200 against one Dollar at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Kwacha is likely to be devalued further as the lack of foreign
currency continues in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week Germany said it will not release its aid to Zambia
as it pledged until ZCCM is privatized because the ZCCM is
losing.
</P>
<P>
In May this year the donors pledged to give Zambia an aid of
530 million Dollars.

</P>
<P>
"Increased contacts and consultations between leaders from the
two countries have added impetus to bilateral ties," said Wu.

He described Sino-British economic and trade links as generally
good. "Britain, China's second largest trade partner in Europe, is
continuing to increase investments in China," according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that greater efforts can be made to explore more
channels and areas for cooperation and support enterprises,
particularly cooperation between small and medium-sized
enterprises in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said high-level exchanges have greatly promoted
bilateral cooperation and noted that Britain has cited 1998 as the
"Year of China." He noted that Britain is delighted at the fact
that closer cooperation in areas such as trade and culture will
further promote the development of bilateral ties.

GUANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
recently set up a marine police emergency network, according to
Lin Maoqing, deputy director of the Frontier Defence Bureau of
Guangdong, who said that the 50-million-yuan (6 million US

He went on to say that ultra-shortwave signals are a major
feature of the system and the province has 16 ultra-shortwave
automatic transfer stations on the mountains along Guangdong's
coast and the network can be used to deal with illegal activities
at sea as well as to help fishermen in trouble.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the center has received more than 1,200
emergency calls and had to respond in 130 situations, and help

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 Pokot herdsmen living
in western Kenya have been killed in an ambush by Karamojong
raiders from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The attackers Thursday ambushed more than 200 Pokot youths who
were taking their animals for grazing at West Pokot's Lopitit
area, only five kilometers from the border, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
There was a fierce exchange of fire Thursday morning before
the Karamojong escaped, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the killing, some residents fled their homes,
fearing further attacks. A group of 20 local businessmen also
closed their businesses.
</P>
<P>
The raid comes barely a month after the Kenyan government
deployed troops in western and central areas, including West
Pokot, to recover guns which were being used in tribal attacks
between the Pokots and Marakwets there.
</P>
<P>
There is a history of cross-border raids between the
Karamojong and Pokots, as well as the Karamojong and Turkanas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on U.S.-Asia Relationship in Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton stressed the importance of the relationship between the
U.S. and all of Asia here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have a fundamental interest in promoting stability
and prosperity in Asia. Our future is tied to Asia's. A large and
growing percentage of our exports, our imports and our investments
involve Asian nations."
</P>
<P>
Addressing 900 business leaders at an event organized by the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) and the American Chamber
of Commerce in Hong Kong, Clinton said that the recent events in
South Asia, in Indonesia, in financial markets all across the
region "remind the American people just how very closely our
future is tied to Asia's".
</P>
<P>
Noting a vast, rich, complex, dynamic relationship between the
U.S. and Asian nations built over the course of two centuries,
Clinton said: "at the dawn of the 21st century, our futures are
inextricably bound together -- bound by a mutual interest in
seeking to free future generations from the specter of war."
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Korean Peninsula, Clinton said: "We clearly
have an interest in trying to get a peace on the Korean Peninsula.
We will continue to work with China to advance our efforts in the
four-party talks, to encourage direct and open dialogue" between
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Our security is also enormously enhanced by a positive
partnership with a prosperous, stable, increasingly open China,
working with us, as we are, on the challenges of South Asian
nuclear issues, the financial crisis in the region, the Korean
peace effort, and others, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said: "our oldest ties to Asia are those of trade and
commerce, and now they've evolved into some of our strongest."
</P>
<P>
He said today roughly a third of U.S. exports and 4 million
jobs depend on its trade to Asia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong is now America's top consumer for cell
phones. Over 1,000 American companies have operations in Hong Kong
alone.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Troops End Standoff in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
policemen ended a tense standoff in the Gaza Strip early Friday
morning following intensive mediation involving American and
Egyptian officials, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached to end the standoff after talks
between head of Israeli army's Southern Command Yom Tov Samiya and
Palestinian security chief in Gaza Mohammed Dahlan, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Dahlan persuaded Abdul Aziz Shahin, minister of supplies in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) who led the Palestinians in
the standoff, to leave the restaurant where he was holding out.
</P>
<P>
To prevent possible armed conflict, Egyptian Ambassador to
Israel Mohammed Bassiouny and U.S. envoy Dennis Ross also
intervened late Thursday night by contacting Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also spoke by phone
with PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), as well as with
Ross, in a bid to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The tension began late Thursday when Palestinian police and
civilians blocked access to the Gush Katif Jewish settlement to
protest against Israeli closure of a section of a coastal road.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers barred Shahin and a convoy of some 22
Palestinian vehicles from traveling from the Egyptian border to
Gaza City via the coastal road, part of which Israeli soldiers
said was off-limited to Palestinians for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the standoff, Israel sent reinforcements and
deployed tanks and armored personnel carriers at key points, while
Palestinian policemen took fortified positions a short distance
away. An Israeli army spokesman charged that this incident was
clearly a provocation planned by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Israel and the PNA had agreed to set up a
joint committee to discuss the future of the disputed road. A
senior PNA official was quoted as saying that part of the road
would be open soon to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The standoff came at a time when tension is mounting between
the two sides due to the prolonged deadlock in the peace process,
which is stalled mainly by the dispute over Israeli second
pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension, Israel and the PNA have beening trading
accusations over a recent Israeli decision to expand the
boundaries of the disputed holy city of Jerusalem and the PNA
efforts to upgrade its status in the United Nations.

<P>
According to official sources, the U.S. is Hong Kong's second
largest trading partner and export market in 1997. Hong Kong's
two-way trade with the U.S. reached 442 billion HK dollars (57
billion U.S. dollars), up six percent from 1996. Hong Kong's total
export to the U.S. last year reached 316 billion HK dollars (44
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that in recent months when markets tremble in
Tokyo or Hong Kong they cause tremors around the world.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I have not only sought to ease the Asian economic
difficulties, but to institutionalize a regional economic
partnership through the Asian Pacific Economic Council leaders
meetings... That is why I'm also working to broaden and deepen our
economic partnership with China and China's integration into the
world economic framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.S.-China economic ties and trade, Clinton said
the United States purchases 30 percent of the exports of China --
far more than any other country in the world, far more than its
percentage of the world's GDP.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "We very much want China to be a member of the
World Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
"I also would say in that connection I am strongly supporting
the extension of normal trading status, or MFN to China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said that the United States and Asia are bound by
family ties, perhaps the most vital ones.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that seven million Americans today trace their
roots to Asia. Last year 3.4 million Americans traveled to Asia
and 7.8 million Asian traveled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of young people are crossing the Pacific to study,
and in so doing, building friendships that will form the
foundations of cooperation and peace for the 21st century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As the world becomes smaller, the ties between Asia and the
United States -- the political ties, the family ties, the trade
ties, the security ties -- they will only become stronger, he
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley, TDC Chairman Dr.
Victor K. Fung and Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong Jeffrey Muir also made speeches separately at the event.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton flew into Hong Kong from southwestern China's
picturesque city of Guilin Thursday evening on the last leg of his
nine-day China visit. He is scheduled to leave for home late
Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> New Airport Regarded Significant for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The grand opening here on
Thursday of the new Hong Kong International Airport by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin is of special significance as it will inject
new vitality into Hong Kong by boosting the people's confidence,
newspapers here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, a multi-billion-dollar project completed after
eight years' construction, is located on a 1,248-hectare reclaimed
site at Chek Lap Kok off the northern coast of Lantau Island, 25
kilometers west of the Hong Kong Island. Operating around the
clock, the airport has a designed capacity of handling 35 million
passengers and three million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's appearance at the opening of the new airport
demonstrated the central government's firm support for Hong Kong's
major infrastructure projects and its efforts to promote economic
development, said an editorial of Chinese-language newspaper Wen
Wei Po.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang also brought the good wishes of the people in
the motherland to the Hong Kong people who are making efforts to
further promote business and trade through worldwide cooperation,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The new international airport, one of the most advanced
airports in the world today, will help guarantee that Hong Kong
remains the most prosperous international center for
transportation, trade, finance and tourism with broadest
international links, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
On the historic day of July 2, 1998, President Jiang's special
plane was the first aircraft to take off from the airport after
its official opening while several hours later, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's special plane became the first aircraft to land at
the very same airport, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the new airport amid the Southeast Asian
financial turmoil will encourage Hong Kong people to forge ahead
in this difficult time, help each other and aim high for more
achievements," it added.
</P>
<P>
"New Airport Injects Vitality Into Hong Kong for a New
Takeoff," reads the title of a Friday editorial of the local
newspaper Hong Kong Commercial Daily.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new airport by President Jiang before his
departure from Hong Kong and the beginning of its commercial
operation will greatly increase Hong Kong's exchanges with the
mainland of the motherland and countries and regions in other
parts of the world, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"The new airport will inject new vitality into Hong Kong's
economic development and help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an
international and regional center of finance, trade, aviation and
tourism and enhance its competitiveness in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Working as one through concerted efforts, Hong Kong residents
can certainly overcome temporary difficulties and achieve a new
economic takeoff," the newspaper added.

HANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The city of Zhoushan in China's
Zhejiang Province plans to build its port into a regional shipping
hub, mainly for transferring petroleum and minerals and for

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls have showed
their interest to Phoenix Suns' assistant Scott Skiles and hoped
to hire him as the head coach for the six-time champion team,
according to a press report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have asked the Suns permission to talk with Skiles
about replacing Phil Jackson. Skiles was among five or six
candidates for the Chicago job.
</P>
<P>
Skiles declined to comment on whether the Bulls or any other
team has contacted him or whether he expected to be a head coach
next season.
</P>
<P>
"This summer, next summer, I'm not tied up into a time or
anything," he said. "I'm just going through it like everyone else
does."
</P>
<P>
Suns general manager Bryan Colangelo said only that the club
told Skiles when he was hired that it wouldn't stand in the way of
his getting a head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
Skiles, 34, is considered one of the hot young coaching
prospects in the NBA. He played in the league for 10 years and
holds the NBA record with 30 assists in a game.
</P>
<P>
He first took coaching job in Greece, then joined the Suns last
year as coach Danny Ainge's top assistant.

<HEADLINE> President Foresees Closer Kazakh-Sino Ties with Jiang's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan is looking toward
trade and cooperation with China to boost its economic
development, says Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were particularly good
since the formulation of a border agreement, according to
Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
Now the two countries are preparing to sign another agreement,
casting a final settlement over the last two disputed border areas
when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visits Kazakhstan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's last visit in 1996 set a new course in Sino-Kazakh
ties, establishing a friendship for the next century, said
Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
Just days before Jiang's attendance to the Alma Ata summit
between China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan and
his visit to Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev spoke to Chinese journalists
about Sino-Kazakh relations and the five-nation talks.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation with China was one way that leads
Kazakhstan into the world economic system, Nazarbayev said, adding
that both countries have stepped up cooperation in recent years
and border trade especially had been brisk, with a series of new
border ports opening up.
</P>
<P>
As one of Kazakhstan's main investors, China was ready to
participate in the construction of the new capital of Kazakhstan,
Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' economic cooperation however is still in its
early stages and thus had tremendous prospects for further
development, the president said.
</P>
<P>
China enjoyed prestige in the fields of politics, the military,
economy, culture and science and China played a important role
which could not be ignored in fighting the southeast Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev reiterated his country's stand against separatism,
saying it opposed separatism in any form and supported China's
stand of non-division and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan upheld this principle not only in the terms of
Sino-Kazakh relations but throughout the region and the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the five nations signed a series of important
documents in 1996 in Shanghai and in 1997 in Moscow, thus
establishing the military confidence in the area bordering the
former Soviet Union and China and beginning the reduction of
troops stationed along the thousands of kilometers of border
areas, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
These documents have done much to build friendship and mutual
trust across the vast area of the Asian continent, Nazarbayev
said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Mayor Calls for Establishing Satellite Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Satellite towns should be established
around Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka to ease population
pressures on the city, English newspapers here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is an urgency as the city's population will increase at
the beginning of next millennium, and by 2020 it will go beyond 20
million," Dhaka Mayor Mohammad Hanif said at a workshop on "Road
Safety Action Plan" jointly organized by the World Bank and the
Dhaka City Corporation here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka is now under an overload of 9 million people living in an
area of only 347 square kilometers against its capacity for 4
million to 5 million people, according to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
There is no dearth of law to check road accidents, but the
problem is the lack of effective enforcement, Hanif pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Accidents could be checked to some extent if licenses were not
issued to drivers of motorized and non-motorized vehicles before
testing their driving skills, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90,000 licensed rickshaws presently ply the city
streets while the unofficial figure is estimated at more than
200,000, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Dhaka alone had about 225,000 vehicles, more than half
of the country's total of about 425,000 at the end of 1997. The
actual number of vehicles plying the city can go up to about
300,000 because many vehicles enter from other parts of the
country every day, according to the Bangladesh Road Transport
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the mayor made an urgent call for building some
satellite towns around the city to mitigate the traffic and
population pressures on the city.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission, Austria to Work Together for Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian government set out its
priorities for the European Union rotating presidency on Thursday,
pledging to work with the European Commission, the executive body
of the Brussels-based EU.
</P>
<P>
The new partnership was stressed by Commission President
Jacques Santer and Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima after
their first working session in Vienna to coordinate their work.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said the EU would focus on the expansion,
reforms and the fighting unemployment during Austria's EU
presidency over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Santer said Austria would play a special and "center" role in
the eastward expansion because of its geographical position and
history.
</P>
<P>
But he said the problems with expansion, including financial
difficulties in admitting new member states, could not be solved
in one night.
</P>
<P>
Expansion would be extremely difficult without unanimity on the
issues, said Santer.
</P>
<P>
The commission president also agreed to speed up Agenda 2000,
which includes reforms in structure and agricultural policy. It is
obvious that the reforms would be Austria's main challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian chancellor reaffirmed his goal of lowering
unemployment. He said that his country will continue to carry out
the policies of Britain, Austria's predecessor in the rotating EU
Presidency.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Currency Devalued Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The taka, the currency of Bangladesh,
will be devalued by 1.7 percent from July 5, according to a
statement issued by the country's central bank, Bangladesh Bank,
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second devaluation of the taka so far in 1998 and
the 13th since the present government was formed in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The downward adjustment is in pursuance of the continuing
policy of maintaining incentives for exports and for inflow from
expatriate Bangladeshis, keeping in view the unfolding trends of
the currencies of trade partners and competitors of Bangladesh,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's buying and selling rates for U.S. dollars with
authorized dealer banks shall respectively be 46.95 and 47.25 taka
per dollar effective from July 5, as against 46.15 taka for buying
and 46.45 taka for selling at present, the statement stated.
</P>
<P>
Exporters and the business community as a whole were asking the
government to devalue the national currency against the dollar,
which they said would accelerate exports, particularly ready-made
garments, press reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Though the devaluation might give an impetus to export to some
extent, it would likely to curb the country's imports, thus
further affecting country's revenue earnings, experts pointed out.

<HEADLINE> hke - Ukrainian Cabinet Passes Revised 1998 Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian cabinet endorsed the
revised version of the draft 1998 national budget on Thursday,
cutting the deficit to 2.3 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Under the new draft, deficits for 1998 were reduced from 3.38
billion gryvnas (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars) to 2.34 billion
gryvnas (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars), according to an official
from the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet sources disclosed that the new draft forecasts revenues
of 17.787 billion gryvnas (about 8.7 billion U.S. dollars), 3.3
billion gryvnas (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars) less than the
former draft, and spending of 20.127 billion gryvnas (about 9.8
billion U.S. dollars), 4.4 billion gryvnas (about 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars) less.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign debt used to pay for the state debt and
deficit was also decreased from 3.079 billion U.S. dollars to
2.882 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Ukraine's financial crisis intensified with
its deficits for the first quarter far exceeding the standard set
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the IMF's demand of a deficit of no more than 2.5
percent of the GDP, Ukraine's cabinet needed to revise its 1998
budget. The draft is due to be submitted to the parliament for
ratification.

<HEADLINE> IMF Blamed for Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panichpakdi has accused the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
making wrong assessment of Thailand's crisis-hit economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF did not heed Thailand's warnings last year that the
crisis threatened to turn into a regional financial maelstrom,
Supachai was quoted by Friday's The Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was wrong because it failed to predict that the crisis
would spread out to other countries in the region, Supachai said,
adding that Thailand had to warn the organization of a severe
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on the first anniversary of the baht
devaluation which triggered the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand abandoned a 13-year peg of the baht against the dollar
and floated the currency on July 2 last year. The IMF came to
Thailand's rescue with a 17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar aid package soon
after the crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the most serious problem facing the economy now
is a severe lack of liquidity in the private sector, resulting
from a tight monetary policy designed to prop up the battered
bath.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai share market rallied 5.1 percent in morning
trade yesterday in anticipation of new measures from Tokyo to
stimulate the ailing Japanese economy and repair its banking mess.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus said in Frankfurt, Germany, on Thursday that Southeast
Asian nations had refused to listen to the fund's diagnosis and
advice given as long as 18 months before last year's financial
crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
"Eighteen months before the eruption of the crisis which began

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows Not to Lease Out Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia would never need to lease
out its islands to overcome the current economic crisis if it
consistently implements its economic development programs, a
minister was quoted by Antara News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, State Secretary/Minister Akbar
Tanjung told reporters here Thursday that his office had not put
forward a proposal to President B.J. Habibie concerning the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Issues on renting out Natuna islands in the South China Sea and
Biak district in Irian Jaya Province in the eastern part of the
country turned up when U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
visited Indonesia a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States left its naval base in the Subic Bay and its
airbase in Clark in the Philippines in 1991. It has been mooring
its ships in Singapore since then.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some people broached the idea of Indonesia
renting out Natuna and Biak to the United States for a military
base and using the money to bail Indonesia out of its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung believed that Indonesia would successfully meet the
expectations expressed by the president at a meeting with top
Hindu priests recently.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told the Hindu priests that the economic condition of
the country would move toward a recovery late next year.
</P>
<P>
The main factor for economic recovery is that the political
condition in the country is conducive to the creation of
consistent measures by the government to overcome the ailing
economy, Tanjung added.

<P>
MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Spanish computer experts have
discovered a computer virus set to become active on July 12, the
day of the World Cup finals in Paris.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Panda Software company said Thursday that
the virus was "very complex and destructive" and could erase all
data on the hard disk and automatically print unwanted documents
to printers.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which targets Microsoft Office 97 Word documents,
will show a flashing banner of "Vive la coupe de monde!" (Long
live the World Cup!) on the screens of infected computers when a
user tries to open an MS Word file.
</P>
<P>
A dialogue window will then pop up and the user will be asked
to choose which football team will win the game, while the virus
will be working in the background.
</P>
<P>
The company spokesman added that the virus was probably created
in France as all of its files were written in French.

BANGKOK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports totaled
3.29 million tons worth 45.33 billion baht (1.1 billion U.S.

<P>
In the same period of last year, Thailand exported 2.35 million

The low paddy output from key producers India and Pakistan

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Exercise Can Lower Cholesterol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- People with high cholesterol
need to exercise to get the full benefits of a healthy diet,
according to a study carried in Wednesday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The study, by Marcia L. Stefanick of Stanford University,
looked at men and women who had moderately high LDL cholesterol
and low HDL, LDL increases the risk of heart attacks, while HDL
lowers it.
</P>
<P>
The 377 volunteers were already following healthy diets when
they were placed on the National Cholesterol Education Program's
Step Two diet, the stricter of its recommended low-fat diets.
Some were also assigned to an aerobics program.
</P>
<P>
One year later, they managed to cut their dietary fat intake by
about 8 percent. But without exercise, there was little change in
their LDL levels.
</P>
<P>
When exercise was added, the women's LDL fell by 15 percent and
the men's by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The program had no significant effect on their HDl levels nor
on their ratios of total to HDL cholesterol, which many experts
believe is an important measure of heart disease risk.

<HEADLINE> More Books in Chinese Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Culture reports
that there are now 340 million books on the shelves of China's
public libraries, 3 million more than in 1996, or 126,000 books on
average for every library.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that means a meager 0.31 for each person, and
most of those are in big city libraries.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 Chinese counties have no libraries of their own, and
it is still difficult for most people in poverty-stricken rural
areas to even find a book, Ministry officials say.
</P>
<P>
Libraries spent more money overall last year buying books, 30
percent more than in 1996 in fact, but, the problem of lack of
funds has not gone away.
</P>
<P>
Many libraries have to run cinemas, open restaurants, or sell
other goods just to support their basic business, Ministry
officials reveal, and say that, although there are more than 2,600
libraries in China, many of them occupy a very small space and
some don't even have reading rooms.
</P>
<P>
Officials are afraid that the situation will slow down China's
entry into the information age, in spite of the 7.1 billion books
published in this giant country last year.

CHENGDU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A new theme park fed with water
from the Funan River, reportedly the first of its kind in the
world, has opened in Chengdu, capital of of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The park features a river water environment, purification
facilities and educational exhibits.
</P>
<P>
The complex, which is in the shape of a fish and covers 24,000
sq.m., was jointly designed by an American environmentalist and
specialists from China, the United States and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to enhance the awareness in protecting water
environments. The facility, which highlights the theme that water,
the environment and life rely heavily on one another, shows the
natural water purification process in the Funan River.
</P>
<P>
The river water is diverted into the park and flows through
sculptures, a plant pond and a fish pond. The water is purified
throughout the process and flows back to the river.
</P>
<P>
The city has allocated some 2.7 billion yuan over the past five
years to harnessing the river, with the effort reported to be the
largest environmental protection project in China's urban areas.

which are operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to help related enterprises turn losses into
profits by the year 2000, and will establish 10 enterprise groups
with annual sales volumes of 10 billion yuan each.

BELGRADE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic Thursday urged the ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo to

<P>
Milosevic's call came after a briefing by Foreign Minister

Affairs Committee of the federal parliament Ljubisa Ristic, Tanjug

The resumption of talks, the only way toward the solution of
the Kosovo issue, was in the interests of the province's ethnic
Albanians, the president reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The federal government's stand on Kosovo remained unchanged,
Milosevic said. To ensure equality among all citizens and between
all nationalities, the government would continue to push a
political and peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the United Nations Charter, OSCE (the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe) standard and the Helsinki
principles, the Yugoslavian government would make Kosovo an
autonomous area within Serbia. However Milosevic said that
autonomy should not be at the cost of the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of Serbia and the Yugoslav Federation.

A 56-member Myanmar delegation comprising entrepreneurs from 34
hotels and tourism services will participate in the show and will
meet businessmen from airlines and travel agencies of Singapore to
seek cooperation opportunities with them especially in the air
transport services, the official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's investment in Myanmar ranked second after Britain
with more than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 65 projects at the end
of March, of which nine projects were in hotels and tourism,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Other hotel projects are mostly invested by Thailand, Japan,
Malaysia and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Since August last year, Singapore's Tourism Board, in
cooperation with the Myanmar tourism authorities, has been
conducting training courses in Yangon for Myanmar personnel in
hotel management under the two countries' economic and technical
cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' air transport services, which help develop
tourism, have also been strengthened since both the Myanmar
Airways International, a Myanmar-Singapore joint venture, and the
Silk Air of Singapore are bringing in visitors directly from
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, a total of 190,580 tourists from
24 countries and regions visited Myanmar in the 1997-98 fiscal
year, of whom Japan accounted for the largest number, followed by
Thailand, France and the United States.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 3 (Xinhua) --NATO's top official warned on
Thursday that the alliance would take steps to end the Kosovo
conflict if a peaceful solution was not found.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in Sarajevo that NATO
backed a diplomatic end to the crisis, but was ready to take
further steps if necessary, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that talks on the Kosovo issue would continue, but he
warned that NATO would never allow another conflict like the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Solana Thursday met separately with the three members of the
Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and opposition leaders from
the two political entities, discussing issues such as the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have been killed since tensions escalated
in Kosovo in early March. About 65,000 of the 1.8 million
population have fled their homes in the province, where ethnic
Albanians account for 90 percent of the population. Ethnic
Albanian separatists have been seeking independence from
Yugoslavia since 1981.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Fighting to Save Oldest Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Shasha, a female giant panda in the
Taiyuan Zoo in the capital of north China's Shanxi Province, is
recovering from a heart attack on the eve of her 33rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
Shasha is one of the few senior citizens among Chinese giant
pandas to live past 25. She stopped breathing suddenly on the
night of June 29, because of heart failure. Her heartbeat was
revived after emergency rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zoo keepers had been preparing for her birthday celebration and
ordered cake and candles. Local doctors and zoo keepers concluded
that Shasha is also suffering from epilepsy and cataracts because
of her age.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to prolong a panda's life with current
medical measures because Shasha is too old and too sick," said
Bian Qizheng, a zoo doctor.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures, 37 degrees Celsius in Taiyuan on the night
when Shasha collapsed, is also hazardous to her health, Bian said.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda has not been able to eat or drink since she
fell ill, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
"Shasha now relies on medicine and oxygen completely to extend
her life, and we will spare no efforts even if there is no
possibility for Shasha to survive," said Jia Zhongjian, director
of the zoo.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Needs to Import More Rice: Official </HEADLINE>

MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expected to
import 2.2 million metric tons of rice in 1998 if the La Nina
weather phenomenon, which brings devastating rains and floods,
hits the country in July or August, a newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary William Dar was quoted as saying earlier

already a 55-percent probability that La Nina, sister of El Nino,
will hit the country, up from the previous forecast of 35 percent.

import 1.65 million metric tons of rice, of which around 1.2
million metric tons have already been brought in, the newspaper
The Philippine Star said.

But the food agency warned earlier that if La Nina comes in,
the country may need to import another 500,000 metric tons of
rice.
</P>
<P>
The final decision as to how much needs to be imported will be
handed down by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
The NFA has already started discussions with its traditional
rice suppliers, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, for
additional import volumes on top of the 1.65-million-metric-ton
standby.

<HEADLINE> Number of Poor in Indonesia Reaches 79.4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor people in
Indonesian has increased from 22.5 million in 1996 to 79.4 million
now due to the monetary crisis hitting the country since July
1997, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 22.6 million were living in urban areas and 56.8
million in villages in June, the local press quoted BPS Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The figures would increase to 95.8 million, or about 48 percent
of the total population of 202 million by the end of this year
because no economic recovery is in sight, BPS chief Suwito Sugito
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, a household is defined as poor if its
monthly earnings fall below 227,720 rupiah (15 U.S. dollars) in
urban areas and 177,997 rupiah (12 dollars) in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Sugito explained that the most recent estimates of numbers of
people living in poverty were not based on the biennial national
census survey, which is due next year, but on macroeconomic
indicators including the inflation rate, contraction in income,
changing consumption patterns, population growth and saving rates.
</P>
<P>
The country's per-capita income would fall as the result of a
forecast 10-percent contraction in the economy, he said, adding
that purchasing power would also be weakened by the expected
inflation rate of 80 percent. Inflation was running at 46.6
percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a return to political stability is crucial if
the country is to recover from the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund
provisions were made for the Indonesian government to begin a
social safety net program to help the poor survive the economic
crisis. Total funds channeled into this initiative are expected to
reach 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Allows Direct Overseas Recruitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government now
allows foreign employers to directly recruit the country's workers
to resolve the explosive unemployment problem, the local press
Friday quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We must seek as many job opportunities overseas as possible
for the jobless. About 15.4 million people have lost their jobs
and this figure is expected to continue rising in coming months,"
Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The government would simplify the official procedures to get
work documents while foreign employers have to be given access to
villages across the country to recruit workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is aimed at easing the unemployment problem that
has been intensifying since the country sank into a crippling
economic crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
More and more companies are going bankrupt as the rupiah, the
country's currency, has lost about 80 percent of its value against
the U.S. dollar, while business has practically come to a halt
since the massive mid-May riots in Jakarta and other areas.
</P>
<P>
This new policy is also expected to help prevent workers from
taking the illegal way to go and work overseas, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many job seekers leave Indonesia
illegally, mostly because of complicated bureaucratic procedures.
Besides, they have no money to pay the recruitment fee and are
extorted by unauthorized labor brokers and corrupt government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the government is making efforts to
provide the maximum legal protection to workers abroad.

</P>

should be made to market idle buildings, which have a combined
area of 3.39 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
While optimistic about the prospects of Fujian's real-estate
industry, developers must keep sober-minded and conduct good
market surveys to avoid blind investment, the official warned.

<HEADLINE> Paper Boxes Oust Plastic on Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one month after plastic food
containers were banned on some trains, the railway authority is
still battling with the problem of finding a substitute of the
right quality.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways' Epidemic Prevention Division issued a
notice banning the use of plastic containers on through passenger
trains to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, to mark the 26th World
Environment Day, which fell on June 5.
</P>
<P>
The decision involves about 400 trains.
</P>
<P>
Ding Qinxue, head of the ministry, said one problem is that
liquid leaks from the paper boxes currently used as a substitute
for plastic containers.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the relatively high price of paper boxes
compared with plastic ones.
</P>
<P>
Barring these inconveniences, paper boxes appear to perform
well, since they decompose rapidly in rainy seasons, he added.
</P>
<P>
Where they remain intact, rubbish collectors prefer to pick up
paper boxes, which have a higher recycling value. Plastic boxes
are generally left behind.
</P>
<P>
Ding stressed that substituting paper boxes is only an
experimental temporary solution.
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that paper making itself is one of the most
polluting industries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Foreign Debt Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' outstanding foreign
debts rose to 51.1 billion U.S. dollars as of the first quarter of
the year from the year-ago level of 45.7 billion dollars,
according to the Central Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a report published Friday, the central bank said that of the
total, those approved by or registered with the bank stood at 45.7
billion dollars, slightly higher than the 45.4 billion dollars as
of end-1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure included debts of the government, state
corporations, and private companies.
</P>
<P>
The central bank excluded from its computation a total of 5.4
billion dollars in private-sector loans which didn't get its
approval but were merely monitored.
</P>
<P>
These comprised 2.4 billion dollars of unregistered loans and
lease agreements of the private sector and 2.95 billion dollars
worth of inter-company accounts of foreign bank branches in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier urged the central
bank to include these items in the computation as they tend to
understate the country's overall debt exposure.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the rising debt was tempered by the
fluctuations in the exchange rate of various currencies against
the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen which fell to 131.9 at
the close of March from 130.4 by end-1997.
</P>
<P>
The debt level is expected to further rise as the new
administration expects to rely more on foreign borrowings to cover
a projected 40-billion-peso (1 billion dollars) budget deficit
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Martina Hingis of
Switzerland was knocked out of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships
Thursday after losing in straight sets to Czech tennis veteran
Jana Novotona.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the reigning world tennis teenage queen, seemed to be
cruising to another easy victory after breaking Novotna's first
service. However, the 29-year-old Novotna displayed aggressive
tennis and effectively put Hingis on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
After snatching the first set 6-4, Novotna consolidated her
position and finally forced the world number one player out of the
championships by winning the second set by the identical score.
</P>
<P>
In the other women's semi-final confrontation, 30-year-old
Nathalie Tauziat of France booked her first grand slam final
position after beating her Belarussian opponent Natasha Zvereva by
1-6, 7-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the men's semi-final clashes to be staged Friday, defending
champion Pete Sampras of the United States will play 12-seed Tim
Henmen of Britain in order to defend his Wimbledon honor.

<HEADLINE> Celadon Discovery Suggests Ancient Export Seaport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of more than a
thousand pieces of celadon dating to the Tang Dynasty (618-907)
provides further evidence that Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang
province has long served as a major export seaport.
</P>
<P>
The relics, including fragments of bowls, jars, dishes, plates,
boxes, and kettles, were mainly produced by a famous Tang Dynasty
kiln famous for its celadon and Mise, or strangely colored
porcelain.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts note that the find verifies records that Ningbo
was one of three major Tang Dynasty export seaports along with
Yangzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province and Guangzhou in south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Porcelain produced by different kilns during the Song Dynasty
(960-1279) have also been found in the upper layer at the site.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have also unearthed remnants of a moat built
during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Censures U.S. Dairy Export Incentive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wellington, July 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand, one of the world's
major dairy product exporters, Friday protested against U.S.
subsidization of its dairy exports through its Dairy Export
Incentive Program (DEIP).
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's protest followed this week's announcement by the
United States of the 1998/1999 round of DEIP subsidies, which are
applied to designated quantities of products and assist the
competitiveness of U.S. dairy exports in international markets.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in 1998/1999, the United States will
subsidize 84,212 tons of skimmed milk powder exports (compared
with a subsidy allocation of 92,217 tons in 1997/1998), 29,854
tons of butterfat (34,232 tons in 1997/1998), 5,003 tons of whole
milk powder (7,487 tons in 1997/1998), and 3,350 tons of cheese
(3,510 tons in 1997/1998).
</P>
<P>
"While we note that the United States has reduced its DEIP
subsidies as required under its Uruguay Round obligations, we will
continue to advocate the elimination and prohibition of this and
all forms of export subsidies," New Zealand Minister of
Agriculture Lockwood Smith said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to end these DEIP subsidies "as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand minister said his country would monitor closely
the practical impact of the latest subsidy allocations on world
prices and on New Zealand's unsubsidized dairy exports.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: "Three Noes" on Taiwan is U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for the U.S. State
Department James Rubin said here Thursday that the "three noes" on
Taiwan is the U.S. policy stated on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
At a routine daily press briefing, Rubin said: "The fact that
we have a position on not supporting Taiwan independence; not
supporting one China, one Taiwan; not supporting Taiwan membership
in international organizations that require the party to be a
state is something I've said from this podium. In fact, I
remember saying it."
</P>
<P>
Rubin was the first U.S. official who explicitly announced the
"three noes" on Taiwan last October when Chinese President Jiang
Zemin visited Washington.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Taiwan has been at the core of Sino-U.S.
relations. China demands the United States stick to the three
joint communiques signed with China and stop arms sales to
Taiwan. Committing itself to the "one China" policy embodied in
the three joint communiques, Washington says that it is also bound
by the "Taiwan Relations Act" enacted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The law authorizes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The sale of a large number of F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan in
the 1990s and the open attempts on the part of Taiwan to seek
independence have prompted China to urge the United States to be
less ambiguous about its Taiwan policy.
</P>
<P>
Rubin for the first time made the "three noes" clear and public
within the context that the United States and China are seeking
constructive strategic partnership toward the next century.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recalled Thursday that this policy was reiterated
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in May when she visited
Beijing to prepare the ground for President Bill Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton left Guilin in southern China Wednesday and
is now in Hong Kong, the last leg of his nine-day trip to China.
He is returning home Friday. He was the first U.S. president to
visit China in almost 10 years.

</P>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Peruvian woman gave birth to a 6.5
kilogram baby in the city of Arequipa, 1,000 kilometers south of
Lima, the local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The "superbaby" was born in the Goyeneche Hospital of Arequipa,
where he was put under intensive care inside an incubator, because
he presents apnea symptoms, hospital authorities were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The unusual delivery occurred two days ago, when the medics
decided to perform a Caesarean operation on Mrs. Epifania Anco de
Huachani, 40, because the difficulties presented for a normal
delivery.
</P>
<P>
The medics attributed the weight of the baby to a genetic
defect caused by the diabetes that has affected the mother for
many years.
</P>
<P>
Cesar Solorzano, the medic in charge of the delivery, hinted
that the infant might be suffering some kind of ailment, since his
heart does not work as it should.
</P>
<P>
Epifania, mother of other four children, said neither she nor
her husband have a steady job. "I do not know what will be the
fate of my family, since we have economic problems and my new baby
might have some illness that will cause more spending," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Supports Romania's Admission to NATO, EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Romania's admission to European
and Euro-Atlantic bodies will be both to the interest of Romania
and the interest of Denmark, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen told the press in Bucharest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Niels Helveg Petersen, who is on a one-day official visit in
Romania, said that the main reason for his current visit to
Romania was to find first-hand facts about Romania's demarches for
intergration into the European Union (EU) since Denmark was deeply
engaged in the process of EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The Danish government was pleading for the EU's extension since
this was the main element that can guarantee Europe's long-term
stability and security, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Denmark's support for Romania's admission to both
structures, saying Denmark wanted to be part of a strong and
enlarged EU.
</P>
<P>
Petersen also voiced his "conviction that an increase in the
support funds would be necessary in a pre-admission phase, a
difficult phase, when the applying countries need more substantial
backing."
</P>
<P>
In his visit, the Danish minister had talks with his Romanian
counterpart Andrei Plesu and was received by Prime Minister Radu
Vasile. He also met with Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Ion
Diaconescu and Senate President Petre Roman.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Return Anniversary Marked in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office held a
cocktail reception here Thursday to mark the first anniversary of
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception which was attended by over 400
prominent figures from German political and business circles, Lore
Buscher, director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
Office in Frankfurt, outlined the bright future for Hong Kong
despite the negative impact from the recent Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The past 12 months had demonstrated the smooth and successful
implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle which
gives Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, she said.
</P>
<P>
The lifestyle of Hong Kong people remained intact and business
went on as usual in Hong Kong, she added.
</P>
<P>
On the recent Asian financial crisis, Buscher said, "Despite
the negative impact of the crisis, Hong Kong is clearly in a
better shape when compared with its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the belief that Hong Kong economy would
recover as the first from the crisis thanks to a number of unique
factors, including its transparent finance system with
well-functioned supervision mechanism, the stable currency, the
budget surplus and sufficient foreign exchange reserves as well as
its close links with the Chinese hinterland.
</P>
<P>
"With Hong Kong people's imaginativeness, flexibility, their
ability to adapt quickly to changed situations, along with a wise
economic policy and the traditionally high degree of stability and
economic freedom, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will
be able to master the current difficult situation," Buscher said.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, a photo exhibition was also put on show on
Hong Kong's new airport, which is due to start operation on July 6
to give a great boost to Hong Kong's role as a regional
transportation and aviation center.

<HEADLINE> Sloan Signs 3-Year Contract with Utah Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan has
signed a three-year contract to continue his position with the
Finals-beaten team last season, according to a press report here
today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which runs through the 2000-2001 seasons, was
finalized while Sloan was in Utah for last week's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
"It's done," Jazz general manager Tim Howells told The Salt
Lake Tribune as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sloan, 56, Utah's head coach since December 9, 1988, had one
year remaining on his contract. Howell said Sloan signed a
"completely new" deal with the Jazz, not simply a two-year
extension.
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sloan guided the Jazz to a 62-20 record and a
second straight trip to the NBA Finals, but the team finally lost
to the Chicago Bulls 4-2.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Immediate Inspections on Newest 737 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Thursday
ordered immediate inspections on engines on the newest Boeing 737s
following two inflight engine shutdowns caused by broken engine
parts last week.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered immediate
inspections on 46 engines installed on 23 U.S. airliners, 13 of
which are owned by Southwest Airlines. Nine others are owned by
Continental Airlines and one is owned by Eastwind Airlines.
</P>
<P>
It also stated that the engine part in question, the accessory
gearbox starter gearshaft, must be replaced on all of the aircraft
by September 1 or within the next 750 flight hours.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, two incidents involved the latest versions of the
world's most common airliner, the Boeing 737-700 and -800
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The pilots for two jets flown by Russia's Transaero Airlines
and Norway's Braathens Airlines had to shut off one of their
aircraft's two engines after a gearshaft broke.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Zimbabwe signed here
Thursday agreements to strengthen military cooperation between the
two countries, including cooperation in the defense industries.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords signed by Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos and his visiting Zimbabwean counterpart Moven
Mahachi, Greece will also assist Zimbabwe in training senior
military officers, pilots and doctors, and removing landmines in
the African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Tsohatzopoulos said that Zimbabwe
backed the United Nations' efforts for a single, democratic and
just solution for the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
While supporting the ethnic Albanians's efforts for broad
autonomy and self-administration in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, the minister said that it was "unacceptable" for
minorities using force in the name of self-determination to try
and change the present borders in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He opposed a military intervention to the Kosovo problem,
warning that this would be a catastrophe which would affect the
surrounding region.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Colombia Toll Road Concession Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday approved
a 137.1 million U.S. dollar loan for Colombia for the toll road
concession project.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve transport conditions along a strategic
road corridor linking Bogota with Medelin, the two most populous
and industrialized cities of the country, and the ports on the
north coast through an effective and sustainable private-public
partnership.
</P>
<P>
The project supports the government's strategy to increase
private sector participation in modernizing its road network. The
strategy is expected to improve efficiency, mobilize additional
resources to provide more rapidly the services for which users are
willing to pay, and reduce the fiscal impact of the modernization
program. The private sector will provide about 70 percent of the
financing.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 572.3 million dollars. In
addition to the World Bank loan, private project sponsors will
provide 395.1 million dollars. Revenues generated from the
operation of roads under the project will finance the remaining
40.1 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Senate Democratic Leader Blasts Tobacco, Insurer Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco and health insurance
companies may have violated federal law with million-dollar
advertising blitzes and should be added to the Justice
Department's inquiry into campaign finance abuses, U.S. Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I fear that these practices will constitute a trend and result
in yet another loophole in our campaign finance laws," Daschle
said in a letter Thursday to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
The senator said the investigation should be based in part on a
complaint against tobacco companies filed with the Federal
Election Commission Monday by the National Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smoking group alleges that the industry will add to
its 40 million-dollar advertising campaign new ads endorsing
Republican senators who voted to kill the Senate's tobacco bill on
June 17.
</P>
<P>
Health insurance companies are preparing a similar campaign,
Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
Citing federal law that prohibits firms from contributing to
candidates, the complaint "makes a persuasive case that this next
phase of advertising is solely intended to affect the outcome of
federal elections, not public policy," Daschle said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco industry spokesman Scott Williams said this week that
the advertisements would comply with federal law.
</P>
<P>
Reno also should investigate the health insurance industry,
which "is now employing an identical advertising strategy in its
attempt to defeat federal reforms of managed care practices and
health maintenance organizations," according to Daschle.
</P>
<P>
"We see this as an attempt to silence our ads and to gag us,"
responded Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the American Association
of Health Plans. "Our ads are focused squarely on the issue of
government mandates, both state and federal, and not even on any
specific piece of legislation."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides 1 Bln Dlr Loan to Support Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday approved
a 1 billion U.S. dollar loan to support policy reforms in the
trouble-ridden Indonesia as a key step towards economic revival.
</P>
<P>
The latest policy reform initiative supports a program jointly
developed by the Indonesian government, the International Monetary
Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
It aims at achieving a restoration of confidence and growth,
protection of the poor from the worst effects of the financial
crisis and particularly punishing drought, as well as smoother
transition of consumption and investment levels and stronger
management and protection of the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
Of the new loan, 600 million dollars will be disbursed
immediately with the balance due for delivery later this year,
following approval in recent months of nearly 400 million dollars
in World Bank project loans designed to improve rural development,
education and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has pledged a total of 4.5 billion dollars to
Indonesia over three years in response to the financial crisis and
the country's development needs. Of this total, the bank is
expected to contribute 2 billion dollars to assist economic
reforms, including money for humanitarian needs, while the
remaining 2.5 billion dollars will fund project loans that stress
poverty alleviation and social investment.

<HEADLINE> U.S Doubtful of Pakistani Defector's Nuclear Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday cast
doubt on the claim by a Pakistani defector that Islamabad had
planned a preemptive strike on Indian nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
"We have no information to support this person's claim that
Pakistan was planning a preemptive strike on Indian nuclear
facilities," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And we note significant discrepancies in his story, as
reported in the press," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iftikhar Khan Chaudry, seeking asylum in the United States as a
defector from Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, said Wednesday
at a new conference in New York that Pakistan had planned a
preemptive nuclear attack on India on April 25. He and other
researchers who opposed the strike threatened to expose it
publicly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan
said Chaudry was an impostor who exposed the U.S. authorities as
simpletons.
</P>
<P>
Khan also vigorously denied that Pakistan had or would ever
plan such preemptive attack on India.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that there was (not) and never has been any plan
in Pakistan for preemptive or nuclear strikes against India. We
certainly have been saying that if India attacks we will
retaliate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chaudry fled Pakistan and entered the United States from
Canada on May 22 seeking political asylum.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Scientists Find Ancient Skull Fossil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Two paleontologists have
found a skull in Namibia which they believe may prove to be the
missing link between modern man and his ancestor, homo erectus or
the axe man.
</P>
<P>
Martin Pickford and Brigitte Senut told reporters on Thursday
that the skull is believed to be about 100,000 years old, placing
it in the Middle Stone Age, and possesses features of the axe man
and of early humans.
</P>
<P>
The skull, which was found at the mouth of the Orange River in
Namibia, also has the distinction of being the oldest human
fossil skull found in that country, South African Press
Association said.
</P>
<P>
Mine manager Daan Marais found the skull lying in a sandbar at
the mouth of the river about 10 years ago and took it home. It
was only years later that he mentioned the skull to the two
paleontologists who are part of a Franco-Namibian paleontology
expedition.
</P>
<P>
When Pickford and Senut saw the skull, they immediately
identified it as being a very ancient human being.
</P>
<P>
"Finding the link to modern man and homo erectus has never
been properly investigated because more emphasis was placed on
finding older fossils.
</P>
<P>
"We were just lucky to have stumbled onto this skull. There
are paleontologists who have been working in areas for years
looking for fossil evidence of a link."
</P>
<P>
He said that the finding places Namibia firmly on the
paleoanthropological map.
</P>
<P>
The well fossilized specimen, nicknamed Old Man River after
its place of origin, consists of a top cranial section which
stops just above the eyes and the back section of the skull.
</P>
<P>
Senut said the skull possesses indentations from veins, which
makes it possible to see which area of the brain was receiving
the most blood.
</P>
<P>
"The skull is larger than homo erectus, but is larger at the
back and tapers towards the front which is different to modern
man," she said. "The veins also show the back lobes of the brain
getting more blood than the front."
</P>
<P>
The frontal lobes are considered areas for thought
development.
</P>
<P>
"Its distinguishing features include thick eyebrow ridges, a
low forehead and a thick skull, all of which suggest he was an
archaic homo sapiens," she said.
</P>
<P>
Senut said that it was difficult to date the specimen, which
had been washed down the river probably during a flood.
</P>
<P>
"Without its geographical context, it is difficult to say with
certainty how old the fossil is," she said.
</P>
<P>
Clay deposits containing hippopotamus and giraffe footprints
have been located at a site near to where the skull was found and
excavations are planned in the hope of finding stone tools and
other bones.
</P>
<P>
According to Senut, amateurs had found fossil hippopotamus
teeth at the site several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"These may yield some information about the age of the
deposits, which are believed to be about 100,000 years old on the
basis of comparisons with other archaic human fossils."
</P>
<P>
The two paleontologists have received permission from the
Namibian government to take the skull to France where tests will
be conducted to determine among other things the age and the sex
of the fossil.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure once we get the tests back on the fossil, it will
provoke a lot of debate," Pickford said. "We may not know for
sure if this is the missing link for another 10 years."
</P>
<P>
After being studied in France, Old Man River will be put on
display at a Namibian museum.
