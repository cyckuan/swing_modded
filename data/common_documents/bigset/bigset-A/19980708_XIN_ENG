<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The western half of Germany continues
to have the world's most expensive labor costs in 1997, a German
survey showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Cologne-based German Economic
Institute IW put western German labor costs at 47.92 marks (26.62
U.S. dollars) an hour in 1997, about 15 marks (8.3 dollars) more
expensive than the average of all major industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Even eastern Germany had labor costs of 32.97 marks (18.32
dollars) an hour, higher than all the other Group of Seven
industrialized countries except Japan which placed 11th in the
rankings with labor costs of 34.97 marks (19.43 dollars) an hour.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which chalked up the world's most expensive
labor costs in the mid-1980s, placed 14th at just 31.83 marks
(17.68 dollars) an hour.
</P>
<P>
The labor costs of France were estimated at 32.03 marks (17.79
dollars) an hour, Italy 29.96 marks (16.64 dollars), Canada 29.20
marks (16.22 dollars) and Britain 28.62 marks (15.90 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Just Peace in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Tuesday stressed that Egypt is keen to bring about a just peace in
the Middle East which realizes the legitimate rights of Arab
people.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks at a meeting with Armed Forces
commanders to mark the 28th anniversary of the Air Defense Forces
Day.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif quoted the president as
saying that Egypt was willing to respect the will of all parties
to reach a suitable decision to realize a just and overall peace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak added that at the same time, Egypt adhered to Arab
rights and restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people so that a just and overall peace could be made.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sherif said Mubarak remained optimistic about realizing
peace in the region despite the "Israeli intransigence, the
absence of credibility as well as reluctance of the major sponsors
of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak is optimistic by nature. He is against
despair," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations have been frozen for
16 months while talks on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks have been
halted since early 1996. The prolonged deadlock has fueled the
speculation that it could lead to violence and confrontation in
the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, viewed as leader in the Arab world, has been playing a
role in advancing the peace process. Only on Sunday, Mubarak held
a three-way summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Jordanian King Hussein in Cairo to discuss the peace process and
coordinate their stance toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders called for continued efforts by all sides to
put the derailed peace process back on track and urged Israel to
honor all signed agreements. They warned that the continuation of
the current situation would be very dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economic Growth Contracts by 12 Pct in 1st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic growth
contracted by 12.23 percent in the first semester (six months)
this year, the National Bureau of Statistics (BPS) announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia therefore will still face a serious economic
recession in the second semester of this year, BPS chairman Sugito
Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicts that overall economic growth this year will
drop by 13.06 percent if no fundamental change in the economic
performance takes place in the second semester, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the national gross domestic product (GDP) estimated to
reach 951.4 trillion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 11,000 rupiah)
this year, he said, Indonesia's GDP per capita would increase from
3.1 million rupiah last year to 4.7 million rupiah this year.
</P>
<P>
The Gross national product (GNP) per capita had also increased
from 3 million rupiah to 4.6 million rupiah. However, he said,
both GDP and GNP were down sharply if they were measured in U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The GDP (per capita) was down from 1,088.7 U.S. dollars to
449.2 U.S. dollars and the GNP (per capita) from 1,055.4 U.S.
dollars to 436.3 U.S. dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic crisis started in July last year, the
Indonesian rupiah has lost more than 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest carmaker Volkswagen
AG announced Tuesday that it would resume car production at a
plant in the Bosnian capital city of Sarajevo where it was forced
to leave during the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed Tuesday by Volkswagen and its Bosnian
partner company Unis Holding, the Volkswagen plant in Sarajevo is
due to resume production from this month with an initial output of
5,000 to 10,000 Skoda Felicia vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen plant in Sarajevo was badly damaged during the
war by Serb forces. Volkswagen said it planned to put an
investment of 48 million marks (26.48 million U.S. dollars) in the
new venture which the company will hold a 58 percent stake while
Unis Holding will have 42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Croatia not to be Under-estimated: Deschamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CLAIREFONTAINE, France, July 7 (Xinhua) -- France's Didier
Deschamps said on Tuesday that France should not under-estimate their
World Cup semifinal opponents Croatia although the latter has not been
regarded as favorite.
</P>
<P>
"We are very proud to have reached the semi-final, but we must make
sure we don't get carried away," he said in the team's training base
in Clairefontaine south-west of Paris.
</P>
<P>
"We still remember only too well the European Championship, where
we took it for granted that we would reach the final even before our
semi-final match against the Czechs. We learn from our mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The Juventus midfielder said he would have to keep the situation
under control in Wednesday's game and "not make any stupid mistakes".
</P>
<P>
But Deschamps, who received a yellow card in the quarter-final
against Italy, said "that doesn't mean that I will be any less
aggressive."
</P>
<P>
He added, "we will have to concentrate hard in defence. I think it
is individual talent that will decide the match."
</P>
<P>
He said he knew Croatia's coach Miroslav Blazevic from his early
days at FC Nantes in the French league.
</P>
<P>
"He's an intelligent, charming and crafty man. He knows how to get
the best out of his players as he has great confidence in himself, and
his self-belief is infectious."
</P>
<P>
France will meet Croatia at the new Stade de France in Saint-Denis
outside Paris on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Fist Minister Warns Peace Process Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's newly-elected
first minister, David Trimble, warned Tuesday that the peace
process was under threat by a three-day-old stand-off between
Protestant Orangemen and security forces over a controversial
parade.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said at a news conference in Belfast, "We all know that
this situation, if it develops badly, has the potential to damage
the entire political process in Northern Ireland. We hope that
this will not happen."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after a second night of riots across the
province sparked by Orangemen's insistence on marching down a
Catholic road in the town of Portadown, 50 km southwest of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Three policemen came under gunfire separately early Tuesday
morning in Belfast while patroling in the city. In other cities in
the province, dozens of incidents happened during the night, with
cars being burned and road blocks being erected.
</P>
<P>
"There are considerable dangers here... there is not an
unlimited amount of time and I do think it necessary for all
sections of the community here to rally round," said Trimble.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British army said it was sending an extra 800
troops to Northern Ireland in addition to the 17,000 already
there.

KUWAIT CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's exports, mainly to
the Gulf Arab countries, reached 21.1 million U.S. dollars in May,
an increase of 73 percent over April, said an official report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by Kuwait's Ministry of Trade and Industry
said that Kuwait's exports to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
member states reached 14.2 million dollars, which accounted for
some 68 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the share of its exports to other Arab and non-Arab
countries stood at about 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said Saudi Arabia is the biggest importer of Kuwaiti
goods in the GCC, absorbing 58 percent of Kuwaiti exports. Saudi
Arabia is followed by the United Arab Emirates, 19 percent and
Qatar, 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's exports mainly included foodstuff, soft-drinks,

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet to Strengthen Int'l Control of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Experts from over 100 countries
began here Tuesday a three-day meeting to discuss how to
strengthen international controls of ozone-depleting substances
like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons).
</P>
<P>
Participants will try to find ways to improve the effectiveness
of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer, said the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss how to make a new licensing system for
controlling trade in CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances
operational by the year 2000, the UNEP said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed system, governments must issue licenses for
each import and export and inform other governments. This will
enable customs and police officials to track trade in CFCs and
detect illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on the Open-ended Working Group's agenda is
whether or not to accept a number of applications for
"essential-use exemptions" that would allow certain developed
countries to use small quantities of particular chemicals for
medical and other special purposes in the years 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
A related matter is how to phase out the use in developing
countries of CFCs in metered-dose inhalers, which are vitally
important to many people suffering from asthma.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also evaluate the progress being made in
adopting ozone-friendly replacements for those substances and
applications where single alternatives to ozone-depleting
substances have not yet been found.
</P>
<P>
These include aerosols, solvents, carbon tetrachloride,
sterilants, rigid and flexible foams, halons, methyl bromide,
refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pumps, and the use of
ozone-depleting substances in military installations.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is a protective fragile shield of gas that
absorbs harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun but has been
increasingly pierced by holes caused by manmade chemicals.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Report on Recognition of Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The French government denied a report
on Tuesday that it is preparing to recognize a Palestinian state
as soon as it is founded.
</P>
<P>
"All that contains nothing new, and there is no change in the
stand of France, which is also that of its partners within the
European Union," said Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said on Tuesday that France will
recognize Palestine as soon as it declares independence after its
interim period of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
It said that the decision was made by the highest French
leaders including President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a Palestinian state was on the agenda for
negotiations on the final status of the Palestinian territory, as
stated in the peace agreements signed in Oslo between Palestine
and Israel, said Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Doutriaux said that France wished that the Middle East peace
process was relaunched.
</P>
<P>
He described France's unilateral recognition of a Palestinian
state as a hypothetical question.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 15 European Union (EU) states at a summit last
month in Cardiff, Wales, asked Israel to recognize the rights of
the Palestinians and give them the right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
And they did not rule out the possible creation of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac said in the spring of 1996 that the
Palestinians had legitimate aspirations for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat repeatedly said that the
Palestinians would establish an independent state as soon as the
transitional autonomous period expired in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has firmly rejected
such a possibility.

<HEADLINE> Asia Attractive for Foreign Investors: Lloyds Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- International investors prepared to
take a long-term view of the Asian economic situation could
prosper from the market as it struggles to recover, Lloyds Bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Asian economies will go through a further lean period
-- restructuring inefficient financial systems and resolving
indebtedness -- the long-term outlook is promising, the bank said
in its latest Economic Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Foley, chief economist of the bank, said, "Asia's
long-term prospects still compare favorably with the rest of the
world."
</P>
<P>
"The huge decline in the stock market and other asset prices
means that Asia businesses now look extremely attractive as
targets for direct foreign investment, especially in countries
where exchange rates have also fallen," he added.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the recent crisis, Lloyds Bank said the UK had been
far less affected than previously believed. Because of limited
dependence on Asian trade, just 0.2 percent had been knocked off
gross domestic product this year by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fears that the UK could be flooded by cheaper high quality
imports have also been unwarranted as Asian manufacturers have
been unable to raise capital to export, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank believed that there might be long-term UK
implications from the crisis fueled principally by U.S. monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, last week
decided to leave them unchanged as the pace of economic growth
slows.
</P>
<P>
Lloyds Bank said that one of the first casualties was the
manufacturing sector which declined for the first time in two
years, partly driven by the crisis in Asia, with whom the U.S.
trades extensively.
</P>
<P>
Foley said, "Should the U.S. raise rates, it will need to take
into account not only the direct impact on the U.S. economy but
also the indirect effect throughout the rest of the world."

<HEADLINE> UK Government Urged to Probe Gulf War Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Gulf War veterans Tuesday
appealed to the British government to stage a public inquiry into
the Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
A group of British Gulf War veterans and their family members
Tuesday delivered a strong petition bearing thousands of
signatures to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, demanding an
immediate public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Tony Flint, spokesman for the National Gulf Veterans and
Families Association, told reporters, "With a public inquiry we
will be able to get behind some of the lies and cover-ups that
have been going on for the last seven years."
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for British veterans insist that a cocktail of
immunizations to protect them against chemical and biological
warfare was the likely cause of the mysterious disease.
</P>
<P>
"The cocktail of vaccinations we were given had never been
tested before. We were guinea pigs," Flint said.
</P>
<P>
Flint noted that among the 51,000 British troops who served in
the Gulf War, 6,000 veterans were now ill and some 250 of them
have so far died from Gulf War illnesses.
</P>
<P>
However, British Ministry of Defense officials said Tuesday
that while the government was committed to addressing Gulf War
veterans' concerns "openly, sympathetically and seriously," there
was no need to open a public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Britain's Armed Forces Minister John Reed launched a
program on offering medical advice to Gulf War veterans and making
research into the Gulf War Syndrome.

<P>
SIPING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, visited a village
near the city of Siping in Jilin Province today to discuss with
local farmers the way of electing village committees.
</P>
<P>
This morning, he went to the village of Huojiadian, with a
population of 2,945, where four village committee elections have
been held since 1988 in accordance with the Organic Village
Committee Law.
</P>
<P>
After visiting two rural families in Huojiadian and watching
videotapes of the village elections, Li discussed the Organic
Village Committee Law and an amendment to it with villagers.
</P>
<P>
Han Xingfu, the head of the village committee, told Li that
villagers' awareness of democracy and participation have gradually
increased after the elections and that the election process has
become more standardized and is on a better legal footing.
</P>
<P>
Li took note of the man's words and asked questions frequently,
showing great concern for the village election.

<P>
During the discussion, Li Peng brought up three important
issues.
</P>
<P>
First, in amending the Village Committee Law, villagers'
democratic rights need to be guaranteed so that they can elect
someone they really trust.
</P>
<P>
Second, the representative meeting, which is not specifically
mentioned in the Village Committee Law, but which has proven to be
a convenient means of voicing villagers' opinions, especially in
large villages, needs to be maintained and even improved.
</P>
<P>
Third, village affairs, especially those that directly involve
villagers' interests, need to be kept open so that villagers can
keep a close watch on village affairs.
</P>
<P>
In concluding, Li emphasized that one favorable way to help
China's farmers become better-off is to maintain democracy and
rule of law in China's immense countryside.

LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The first half of 1998 were the
warmest in history throughout the world since records began,
British weather researchers said Tuesday.

Experts at the Meteorological Office said their provisional

The warmest full year so far was 1997, when temperatures were
0.43 degree Celsius higher than the long-run average, but the
researchers said the record was likely to be broken again this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Office, although El Nino has
been a major contributor to the warm spell, it was not the only
cause. Human activities, through the release of carbon dioxide
from burning fossil fuels, also play a part in the weather change.
</P>
<P>
The global average temperature in 1877/78, when there was a
powerful El Nino, was 0.5 degree below today's average, the
researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Meles: Ethiopia Not Rule Out Use of Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi said Tuesday that ''if the Eritrean forces were not
withdrawn, Ethiopia could not rule out the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
Premier Meles made the remarks while addressing a parliament
session here, an Ethiopian government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meles told parliament that "the Eritrean invasion had come at
a time when Ethiopia was concentrating on peace and development,
which had transformed the country."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is such that we have been taking two
inter-linked actions - the peaceful path and, if it doesn't
succeed, defending our sovereignty," he stated, adding: "parallel
to the peace efforts, Ethiopia has been preparing to defend its
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Meles told parliament members that "the Ethiopian government
has succeeded in securing the whole-hearted support of the
Ethiopian people by making it clear that: we were aggressively
invaded, we desire the peaceful path, when the government
considers that there is no room for a peaceful solution the
sovereignty of Ethiopia will have to be secured by force.''
</P>
<P>
According to Meles, the Ethiopian people have so far donated
at least 100 million Birr (14.3 million U.S. Dollars) to the war
effort and for those displaced by the conflict and militias in
their tens of thousands have registered to defend their country.
</P>
<P>
"Opposition groups that have never worked with the government
have decided to put aside their differences and work together for
defense of the sovereignty of our country," Meles said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Eritrean government withdraws we will solve the
problem peacefully," Meles said, adding that "if it does not
withdraw then, without any doubt, we will force it to do so."
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
arrived here Tuesday to hold talks with Meles on peaceful
resolution of Ethio-Eritrea border dispute. before he came here,
President Museveni had held talks with Eritrean leaders in Asmara
Monday in a bid to mediate the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Djibouti
had visited both Ethiopia and Eritrea last week as the second
part of the peaceful initiative by the Organization of African
Unity.

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday called on Ethiopia and
Eritrea to seek a ground of understanding and solve their
territorial dispute through political means.
</P>
<P>
"The situation remains very worrying and we hope that the two
protagonists could show proof of all possible restraint to avoid
the worse," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that France hopes that both Ethiopia and Eritrea have a
political will to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin is on a visit in Paris
within a Europe tour, which has already brought him to London and
Bonn, to "explain the Ethiopian position" in the conflict between
Addis Abeba and Asmara.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Mesfin Tuesday, French State Secretary in
charge of relations with Africa Charles Josselin said that the two
countries have all the means to solve the problems which come down
from the independence of Eritrea in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Josselin said that France supports all mediation efforts aimed
at creating an atmosphere of confidence, especially those by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
An Eritrean envoy visited France last week also to explain the
position of his government in this conflict.
</P>
<P>
The French spokesman also said that France is ready to offer
diplomatic support to the mediations.
</P>
<P>
France helped solve a territorial dispute between Ethiopia and
Yemen in the Red Sea two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea were plunged into an undeclared war on May
6 because of a territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have massed troops on their common border and
the situation remains highly tense although fighting nominally
stopped on June 11.

<HEADLINE> VW Sets Up Private Fund to Compensate Wartime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest carmaker Volkswagen
AG said Tuesday that it will set up a private fund to compensate
forced laborers employed by the company during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a press release issued Tuesday that the
private fund would be used to provide "humanitarian help" to
individual victims who were forced to work in the wartime
Volkswagen factory in the German city of Wolfsburg during the
period from 1944 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
According to an independent survey quoted by German press
reports, about two thirds of Volkswagen employees during World War
II were forced laborers, including over 1,500 Jewish workers
during the last two years of the war.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen has previously refused to offer direct compensations
to those people. The last move is said to be prompted by a lawsuit
being prepared by 30 former Jewish workers who want to seek
compensations from Volkswagen for their unpaid wages for the
wartime jobs.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Steep Drop in Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment dropped by
seasonally adjusted 122,300 to 4.075 million in June, the sharpest
decline for the month since the 1990 German reunification, the
German Federal Labor Office announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, measured on the basis of
seasonally unadjusted data, fell to 10.5 percent from 10.9 percent
registered in May, the latest jobless data released by the office
showed.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, the number of people out of work fell by
51,900 to a jobless rate of 8.9 percent, and the eastern German
jobless total fell by 70,400 to a rate of 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the June data, German government spokesman Otto Hauser
said that with the economic upswing strengthening in Germany, an
overall trend reversal on the job market had finally been achieved
after years of adverse developments.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the latest positive development should be
attributable partly to the economic reforms introduced by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government over the past years.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition politicians and trade unionists argued that
the positive June data had been artificially boosted by government
job-creation programs ahead of the country's general elections on
September 27 this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. to Open Strategic Dialog in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
will travel to Washington Friday to open the Egyptian-American
strategic dialog, which was designed to speed up coordination
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moussa met here Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's envoy, Greg Craig, who is visiting Egypt to place the
final touches on the upcoming Washington talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Daniel Kurtzer, who attended the
meeting, said that although Egypt and the U.S. have always been
engaged in a dialog, this new dialog would enable the sides to
hold at least one ministerial meeting and periodical meetings on
lower levels every year.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat told reporters that the aim of this
dialog was to create a fast communication channel between the
U.S. State Department and the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"It will enable each side to better understand the demands of
the other end to overcome any type of misunderstandings that
might arise and coordinate stances when required," he said.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the upcoming talks will be the stalled
Middle East peace process and the Israeli refusal to accept the
U.S. proposal for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. At the same time, bilateral economic cooperation will also
take a prominent place.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Egyptian Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros
Ghali discussed with Kurtzer a draft trade cooperation framework
to be submitted to an upcoming meeting of the Egyptian-American
Presidential Council, co-chaired by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and American Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is similar to the accords already struck
by the U.S. with Chile and Mexico, will provide a necessary
framework regulating the Egyptian-American trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said such agreement would be a step forward in concluding
a free trade accord between the two sides. During a visit to the
U.S. later last month, he already discussed with U.S. officials on
ways of increasing bilateral trade and upgrading economic ties.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed how to use the U.S. economic aid to Egypt
to serve the country's new needs of transforming its economy into
a market economy. The U.S. Congress is considering cutting this
aid according to its policy of reducing foreign economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, as the first Arab country to seal peace with Israel,
gets a total of 815 million U.S. dollars of U.S. economic aid
every year.

<HEADLINE> 830 Hutu Youths Give Up to Rwandan Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 830 Hutu youths are
said to have surrendered to the Rwandan army in northwestern
Rwanda, Gisenyi prefecture officials told Rwanda News Agency
(RNA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed a state-run radio Rwanda report that
had earlier indicated that for a period of a month, 803 Hutu
militia youths, girls and boys had handed themselves over to
government officials in Ngororero sous-prefecture, south of
Gisenyi town.
</P>
<P>
Thirty others had reportedly gave themselves up in Karago and
Giciye, formerly home to late president Juvenal Habyarimana.
</P>
<P>
The youths are said to have helped the army to retrieve some
military equipment, including assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
''Some of these young people started training while in refugee
camps in former Zaire,'' the official in charge of administrative
and political affairs in Gisenyi, Gerard Ngoga told RNA.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngoga, the Gisenyi District officials are busy
trying to re-educate the young people through public debates
where issues of national unity and reconciliation are leading
themes, RNA said, in a dispatch to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
''We also plan to organize a solidarity camp like other
returnees to enable them to be integrated in society,'' Ngoga was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The region of Ngororero borders the southern edge of Gisenyi
and Ruhengeri, seen as fertile grounds of Hutu extremists largely
blamed for the violence rocking parts of northwestern Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
For the months of April and May, about 100,000 Hutu civilians
had dissociated themselves with Hutu extremists in northwestern
Rwanda and returned to normal life in villages.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkish Demand for Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday criticized a Turkish
demand for the demilitarization of Aegean islands.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas dismissed the Turkish demand as "historically
unacceptable and groundless," saying that Turkey's such move
undermined the relations between the two countries and did not
contribute to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish demand contained in a document which was handed to
Greece's ambassador to Turkey Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had not honored commitments undertaken in the past, he
said, adding that Greece could not remain indifferent and had no
choice but to organize its defense.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits, the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Turkey has questioned the Greek sovereignty
of several uninhabited islands in the Aegean, but Greece has
rejected Turkey's demand.
</P>
<P>
Greece insists that it has no problems with Turkey in the
Aegean except the continental shelf issue, and if Turkey intends
to question Greece's sovereignty over the Aegean islands, Turkey
will have to go to the international court at the Hague for
arbitration.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-nine percent of Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen say they are more or less leftwing, as compared with
31 percent who claim to be rightwing, according to a poll
published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was conducted by the SOFRES polling group from
June 23 to 26 among 1,000 people representative of the French
population, shows that more men support leftwing parties than
women, and more young people favor the ideas of the leftwing than
the aged.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that the Green Party's support rate is
rising, while the Gaullist RPR is losing its partisan basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 62 percent of French people hold a
positive opinion about the Green Party, 55 percent support the
Socialist Party, and 43 percent support the RPR.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that 74 percent of French people support free
trade, 67 percent support competition, 55 support economic
liberalism, 55 support labor unions, 51 percent support
privatization of state enterprises and 50 percent support
socialism.
</P>
<P>
Around half of the people polled say they don't agree to such
ideas as profits, nationalization of enterprises, protectionism,
capitalism and leadership.
</P>
<P>
SOFRES said the poll shows that more and more French people are
accepting the ideas of market, competition, free trade,
modernization and opening, while both rightwing and leftwing
conservatives are losing support.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Cautions Against Offending Arab Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Prime Minister Crown
Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah Tuesday urged
lawmakers to refrain from openly criticizing Arab leaders,
regardless of their positions on Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah issued the appeal during the National Assembly's
discussion on the annual budget of the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (KFAED), the official news agency Kuna
reported.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on statements made by parliament member
Mosalam Al-Barak, who criticized King Hussein of Jordan for
supporting Iraq during the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al-Barak claimed that the motive for Hussein's current moves to
mend fences with Kuwait were aimed at obtaining loans from the
KFAED. He said the KFAED should change its loan policy following
the 1990 Iraqi aggression against Kuwait and stop assistance to
countries that sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In response, Al-Sabah urged all lawmakers to "carefully select
their words so that they do not offend any Arab or foreign
figure," regardless of their previous or current positions toward
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made it clear that he, like any other
Kuwaiti citizens, was also angry at Jordan's silence before the
1990 Iraqi aggression and its position during the aggression.
</P>
<P>
He added that if any lawmaker had any objection to the
allocation of the KFAED funds, then it could call for amending the
budget without offending foreign figures.

LUANDA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Coordination Program of African
Museums will become a regional professional organization in 1999,
uniting all cultural and intellectual groups in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Valery Chieze who is in charge of the coordination program
under the International Commission of Museums revealed this
during her trip to Angola earlier this month, the Angolan News

</P>
<P>
Chieze also attended the regional convention on museum
management in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the meeting was to establish a proper
mechanism for the Coordination Program of African Museums and
make it a regional professional organization so as to better
preserve the museums and promote the African culture.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a meeting will be held in Lome later in
1998 to work out a new plan for the establishment of such an
organization.
</P>
<P>
Meetings will also be held in Angola, Zambia and the
Democratic Republic of Congo to discuss and resolve issues
concerning languages, history and administration in the process
of setting up the pan-African museum association.
</P>
<P>
Then, a convention will be called in Zambia in 1999 to
officially proclaim the establishment of the professional
organization of museums in Africa.
</P>

BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
Tuesday called on Ethiopia and Eritrea to renounce the use of
force in solving their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Violence is not a permissible means of politics. Neither
Ethiopia nor Eritrea, two of the poorest countries in the world,
can afford to solve their border conflict through military means,"
said Kinkel during a meeting with Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin in Bonn Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin is currently on a Europe tour to explain the Ethiopian
position in the conflict between Addis Abeba and Asmara.
</P>
<P>
According to a German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kinkel called
on both countries to reach a formal truce immediately and stop any
forms of war preparations on their border.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also expressed full support for the
mediation efforts made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
in order to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation
and Development said that existing German development aid to
Ethiopia would remain in place, but new aid would only be granted
after the end of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea were plunged into an undeclared war on May
6 due to the border dispute. Both sides have massed troops on

NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The former soldiers of the Rwandan
government army are pursuing their reeducation courses designed
for their reintegration in normal life.
</P>
<P>
"Before the end of the year, all former Rwandan government
forces (ex-FAR) will have terminated these courses," the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) Tuesday quoted Second-Lieutenant Jean Claude
Bizimana as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bizimana is in charge of the reeducation program.

<P>
The latest group of ex-FAR to end such reeducation courses

obligation they have to associate with other citizens in
safeguarding security.
</P>
<P>
Nteziryayo also promised that some will be reintegrated in the

<HEADLINE> Sudan Government Contacts with Rebels: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Sudanese official has
confirmed that contacts were underway between the government and
the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA), led by John Garang,
on the possibility of ending the bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old civil war between government troops and the
Garang movement, the major rebel group in the south of the
country, has led to heavy human and material losses.
</P>
<P>
In a press release broadcast Tuesday by the Sudan radio, Riyak
Mashar, chief of the Coordination Council of the Southern
Provinces, said that several delegations have been sent to Garang
and some faction leaders supporting him, to narrow the gap and
pave the way for a solution during the upcoming round of talks in
August in Adis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The contacts have achieved positive results, Mashar said,
emphasizing the necessity of continuing this effort to bring the
two sides closer.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out Garang's involvement in the recent bombing attacks
that took place on June 29 and 30 in capital Khartoum. The attacks
were aborted by the Sudanese security organs.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that it was not in Garang's interest to
topple the incumbent regime in Sudan, and asserted that "Garang
would take the peace track."
</P>
<P>
The rulers and governments of the southern provinces were
instructed to go immediately to their posts and assume duties,
Mashar noted.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation work in the southern provinces have started,
he said, adding that members of his mission would head within days
for the south to inspect the progress by themselves.

Meanwhile, Othman Ibrahim Al-Tawil, member of the coordination
council, has complained about the displacement, homelessness,
famine and diseases in the 10 southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a transitional period and that the council was
moving slowly. He added that the monthly financing of the Ministry
of Finance was that "We spend out of what we collect" and this
explained why the council is facing a financial deficit.

<HEADLINE> Asylum-Seeking Pakistani, Fraud: U.S. Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists and
administration officials have found that a Pakistani man's
allegation about Pakistan's planned preemptive nuclear attack on
India was inconceivable and he is a fraud, according to Tuesday's
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Frank von Hippel, chairman of the research arm of the
anti-nuclear weapon Federation of American Scientists, said he and
several Princeton University associates reached their conclusion
after interviewing Iftikhar Khan Chaudry for an hour.
</P>
<P>
Chaudry fled his motherland last month and came to the United
States asking for political asylum by offering what he alleged
Pakistan's planned nuclear strike on India.
</P>
<P>
He has been interviewed thereupon by the FBI in relation to his
claims, but the bureau has not commented publicly on the case.
</P>
<P>
However, Hippel has now made it public after his interview with
Chaudry, saying "everything was wrong."
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't know the most elementary facts about what a nuclear
reactor is," he said. "Our guess is he doesn't have more than a
high school education." It contradicts Chaudry's claim that he has
a graduate education.
</P>
<P>
A senior administration official who has reviewed government
agencies' reports about Chaudry's claims said he is "an absolute
fraud."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials have asserted that Chaudry is not a nuclear
physicist, but an accountant at a firm that manufactures bathroom
tiles.
</P>
<P>
Chaudry's father also disavowed his son's story, saying he has
studied business and was not a scientist.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Defense Minister Leaves for Russian Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis
Omirou left here Tuesday for a four-day visit to Russia, during
which he will discuss bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Larnaca International Airport before
his departure for Moscow, Omirou said he would discuss with his
Russian counterpart Igor Sergeyev in Moscow the implementation of
the 1996 defense cooperation agreeement as well as the Cyprus
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that although Cyprus and Russia differed
greatly in size, they enjoyed ties of friendship based on the
principles of international laws. He said both countries were
interested in consolidating peace, stability and cooperation in
the Mediterranean region and rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Omirou noted that at the present time it was particularly
useful to have this exchange of views in order to support efforts
aimed at achieving a just and viable solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops took over the northern
third in the aftermath of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Omirou's trip will be followed by a visit by President Glafcos
Clerides between July 11-14, at the invitation of Moscow Mayor
Yuri Ruskov as a guest of honor at the World Youth Games. Clerides
will also meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of the two Cypriot leaders' Moscow visit is
the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 ani-aircraft missiles,
which are scheduled to be delivered next month.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the Russian missiles in 1997 in
a bid to boost its air defense, but the deal has triggered
warnings from rival Turkish Cypriots and their powerful ally
Turkey, which threatened to take "all necessary measures" to
prevent the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has declared that the missile deal could
be cancelled only if progress is achieved in reaching a peaceful
settlement, for example, the realization of the island's
demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
The position was echoed by Russian Foreign Ministry official
Valery Nesterushkin, who said earlier this week that Moscow could
scrap the delivery of the S-300s "if efforts aimed at studying a
demilitarized status for the island become reality."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that if there was no progress in getting
the two sides to reach an agreement, then the delivery of the
missiles would be go ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots
have broken down since last Summer when Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash walked out the talks to protest against European
Union's intention to open accession talks with the Cypriot
government.

<HEADLINE> China on Ways to Resolve Problems Facing Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
United Nations Qin Huasun suggested ways to resolve the problems
facing the developing countries in market access at the annual
session of the Economic and Social Council which opened Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the goals of economic development of the developing
countries and the need for gradual opening of their markets
consistent with such goals should be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries shall not insist on opening their markets
without taking full consideration of the level and stage of
development of the developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the developed countries must scrupulously honor their
commitments to improve market access for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said they should stick to their commitments to eliminate
tariff peaks made in the Uruguay Round, reduce non-tariff
barriers, cease the abusive use of anti-dumping measures, provide
more market access opportunities for the goods and services of the
developing countries and improve the external economic environment
for the developing countries to enable them to derive greater
globalization and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the World Trade Organization should at this
stage concentrate its efforts on the implementation of the Uruguay
Round Agreements instead of diverting its attention to new issues
that have little to do with market access.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries must strengthen their coordination and
enhance their capacity for participating in the multilateral
trading system, Qin added.

<HEADLINE> Iranians to Start Pilgrimage to Iraq in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Tuesday that Tehran is soon to start sending
pilgrims to visit the Shiite holy sites in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the two neighbors in April,
Kharrazi said, the first group of 3,000 people are to leave for
the holy sites in August.
</P>
<P>
He said that details on the pilgrimage would be announced later
by the Islamic Revolution's Martyrs Foundation and related
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq agreement allows 3,000 Iranian pilgrims each week
to visit southern Iraq, including Najaf and Karbala, where Shiite
holy shrines are located, as a step toward normalization of
relations between the two former enemies.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Baghdad made a tentative move by allowing a smaller
number of Iranian pilgrims to the south to pay heir homage.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian delegation visited Baghdad last month, and reached
an agreement with Iraqi side to close the files of prisoner of
wars (POW) left over from their bloody war from 1980-88.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 5,584 Iraqi POWs were swapped for 319 Iranians in
April. In early June, the two sides exchanged the remains of some
200 soldiers killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Qin Comments on Uruguay Round Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The conclusion of the
Uruguay Round Agreements has significantly reduced tariff and
non-tariff barriers and strengthened the multilateral trading
system, the Chinese representative said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It has also greatly fostered the liberalization of global trade
and provided opportunities for greater participation by the
developing countries in international trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual session of the Economic and Social
Council which opened Monday, Qin Huasun, Chinese ambassador to the
United Nations, said, "However, we have to bear in mind that the
results of the Uruguay Round Agreements are by no means balanced."
</P>
<P>
Qin said those who benefit most from those agreements are the
developed countries, and on the other hand, the needs and
interests of the developing countries have not been fully
accommodated and those of the least developed countries have been
largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements
related to market access has encountered a series of problems
including:
</P>
<P>
-- The developed countries spare no efforts in implementing
those agreements which are in their best interest, but are
unwilling to facilitate the implementation of those agreements
which benefit the developing countries most;
</P>
<P>
-- The developed countries have not loosened their grip on
multilateral policy-making, They arbitrarily expand the scope of
the coordination of the World Trade Organization to include
questions extraneous to market access in the multilateral trading
system. Some countries, in a self-serving manner, selectively
expand new areas of trade, liberalization without regard to the
present level of development of many developing countries, to the
detriment of the latter's economic development;
</P>
<P>
-- The developing countries are still facing many obstacles in
market access. Tariff peaks and tariff escalation in some sectors
in the developed markets are seriously hampering the exports from
developing countries. Moreover, new forms of trade protectionism
risk to further erode the export interests of the developing
countries;
</P>
<P>
-- The present multilateral trading system is increasingly
demanding full reciprocity from developing countries and is thus
undermining the principle of special and different treatment for
developing countries;
</P>
<P>
-- The admission of new members has been delayed by political
considerations and tactics for reaping maximum economic benefits.
Some accession negotiations have become all-encompassing reviews
of the applicants' economic and trade policies. Some members have
been relying on the accession negotiations as the most convenient
venue for resolving bilateral trade problems, thus prolongs the
process of accession negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government Ready to Restart Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Responding to an appeal by the
U.N. Security Council, Cyprus government Tuesday said it was ready
to restart direct talks with Turkish Cypriots to end the disputes
between them.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides told reporters Tuesday that
"President Glafcos Clerides is ready to return to the negotiating
table even tomorrow with a view to find a solution of the Cyprus
question."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council urged Turkish and Greek Cypriots to
resume direct talks after heard a report by U.N. envoy for Cyprus
Diego Cordovez Monday, who met Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash separately last week.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez said Saturday in Nicosia that he has found "the two
sides interested in trying to find a way to resume the talks," and
he has made progress in the effort to reach a new formula for
negotiations acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate, but said this was his first part of a
"two-phase mission to touch base with both leaders to see whether
they were ready to resume direct talks," and he would return to
Cyprus in September.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said at his daily
press briefing Tuesday that the new U.N. appeal proves "the
Council's resolve to break the deadlock and overcome the impasse
in the Cyprus problem," and its "political will to exert pressure
on the Turkish side to enter into a substantive dialog."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace negotiations have been stalled since last July
when Denktash walked out of the talks to protest against a
decision by the European Union (EU) to start accession talks with
Greek Cypriot-led government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has demanded recognition for his self-declared
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the northern part of the
island and Cyprus' withdrawal of its application for the EU
membership before restarting the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
landed troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, but so far little
progress has been made in this direction.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Export 37 Million Dollar Food to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will export 37 million
U.S. dollars worth of food to Iraq next week as part of the United
Nations oil-for-food program, the Middle East News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The food, including some 36,000 tonnes of margarine and 2,000
tonnes of cheese, would be exported by Egyptian state-owned
companies affiliated to the Holding Company for Foodstuffs
Industries, said company head Adel al Shahawi, who returned here
from Iraqi capital Baghdad Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shahawi signed during his visit a number of agreements on
exporting Egyptian products to Baghdad under the
Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Iraq has agreed to import 150 million dollars
worth of foodstuffs from Egypt in the later half of this year and
to increase its food import from Egypt by 250 million dollars next
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program signed in 1996, Iraq
is permitted to sell a limited amount of oil every six months to
import food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception of the crippling economic sanctions
that the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exporting food and medicines to Iraq, Egyptian
companies are also keen to participating in the projects of
renovating Iraq's dilapidated oil facilities and prospecting for
new oil fields.

<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar held talks Tuesday in the capital Abuja with
a high-powered United States delegation on the way forward for
the west African country's political transition program.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar and the U.S. delegation which is led by Thomas
Pickering, the Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs,
discussed issues on returning Nigeria to civil rule, according to
Alhaji Buhari Bala, Nigeria's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed were issues concerning drug trafficking and the
U.S. sanctions against Nigeria, said the minister of state, quoted by a
British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include the sales of military hardware to the
Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Bala said it appeared the discussion was "positive"
when compared with the visit by United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku last
week.
</P>
<P>
"Good results may come out of this," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the release of Nigeria's number one political
detainee Moshood Abiola was not touched at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both Annan and Anyaoku had announced that the Nigerian
government would free Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the
June 12, 1993 presidential polls very soon.
</P>
<P>
It had been widely speculated that the release may be
announced any time from Wednesday at the end of the month-long
nationwide mourning of late General Sani Abacha, the former head
of state who died suddenly on June 8.
</P>
<P>
However, a report reaching here said Abiola died of a heart
attack Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Says Japan's Economy in Morass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin Tuesday described the Japanese economy as being struck in a
morass.
</P>
<P>
"Among the various things Japan needs to do is a sufficient
fiscal program so it can help them get out of the morass that
they've been in," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
His blunt comment came after Japanese ministers reiterated
their promises to overhaul the country's tax code, including a
possibility of tax cut. But no details of the plan have emerged.
</P>
<P>
Japan's maximum combined rate for national and local income
taxes is among the highest in the world and is viewed as a key
reason for a slump in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Tax cuts and reforms to overhaul Japan's debt-burdened banking
system is at the top of a wish list that Washington has repeatedly
submitted to Tokyo, so far without much apparent success.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the key for Japan to revitalize its economy now in
recession is to "have a strong and sustained fiscal stimulus,"
which he said should be Japan's objective.
</P>
<P>
Japan is viewed by the United States as the cornerstone to
defuse Asia's economic crisis, and is under increasing presure
from the international community to live up to its role as the
region's economic powerhouse. But Japanese leaders seem reluctant
to promise major reforms ahead of the July 12 Upper House of
parliamentary election.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Works with Nile Basin States in Water Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Tuesday that is closely
cooperating with Nile Basin countries in making optimal use of
an estimated 1,600 billion cubic meters of Nile water each year.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency reported that Minister of Public
Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abud Zeid made the statement
when addressing the inaugural meeting of a three-day symposium on
Egypt's water resources and its developments.
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting of water resources ministers of the littoral
countries on the Nile will be held in Cairo in September to
discuss ways of optimizing the use of the longest river in Africa
and carry out joint projects benifiting from the Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is developing major national projects such as the Toshka
land reclamation project and Al Salam Canal, which depend solely
on Egypt's quota of 55.5 billion cubic meters without any new
additions, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture consumes about 85 percent of Egypt's Nile water
quota while the remainder is used for drinking and navigation.
</P>
<P>
Zeid said that Egypt's policy is to provide irrigation water
for new projects, through recycling agricultural drainage water
which is estimated at 1 billion cubic meters annually, in addition
to subterranean water in the Delta and the Nile Valley which
exceeds 4.7 billion cubic meters annually.
</P>
<P>
"There are no problems whatsoever among Nile basin countries,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin countries, which groups Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania,
Uganda, Rwanda, Eritrea, Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia, hold
a conference very year during which the water problems are
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
There have been some differences among the Nile littoral
countries over the development projects launched on the river,
with some claiming that these water projects have infringed on the
others' rights.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, accused of trespassing others' share by its recent
construction of the mega project of New Valley, rejected the
charge and urged the basin countries to launch joint ventures to
their common good, instead of evolving a new Nile agreement.
</P>
<P>
The countries overlooking the Nile are bounded by an agreement
signed in 1959 as regards how much water they are entitled to but
some are asking to amend it.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Egypt has access to 55.5 billion cubic
meters, which accounts for 99 percent of its sweet water resources.
</P>
<P>
The 6,700-kilometer Nile, the world's second longest river and
Africa's longest, runs 1,530 kilometers across Egypt south-north
before pouring into the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
With a deficient rainfall over the entire country, human
existence in Egypt depends closely on irrigation from the Nile,
resulting in acute concentration of nearly 98 percent of the
population in the Nile Valley, only 4 percent of the country's
total area.

Uganda is one of the countries in Africa which is succeeding
in combating the deadly disease. The HIV infection in Uganda has
dropped from 13 to 9.5 percent between 1994 and 1997 as a result
of increased HIV/AIDS awareness.

Oppah Rushesha, the head of the Zimbabwean delegation which is

and the political will to help its own anti-AIDS program achieve
the success that Uganda has already registered.

Zimbabwean Deputy Minister for Health and Child Welfare David

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Nanobacteria May Cause Kidney Stones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Finnish researchers said that
the tiny little bacteria -- nanobacteria -- could be the cause of
kidney stones by building a mineral shell, according to Tuesday's
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
Finnish researchers Olavi Kajander and Neva Ciftcioglu of the
University of Kuopio said they found the bacteria in human blood
serum and also in kidney stones.
</P>
<P>
"Nanobacteria are the smallest cell-walled bacteria, only
recently discovered in human and cow blood and commercial cell
culture serum," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
They tested human and cow serum, and found nanobacteria in
both. When they let the serum sit in a test tube for a little
while, the bacteria settled on the bottom. They quickly developed
a thick mineral shell of apatite. These apatite shelters were
apparently the dwelling place of the organisms, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
They thus concluded these could be the starting points of
kidney stones, which build up layer by layer, just like a pearl
forming on a piece of sand inside an oyster.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish researchers found nanobacteria in all 30 people
with kidney stones.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Bilateral Agreement on Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Tuesday that it would not
recognize any bilateral agreement to divide the Caspian Sea into
national sectors for exploiting its resources, Tehran radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted as
saying that a legal regime on the Caspian should be determined by
all of the five littoral states, and Iran would not accept any
bilateral agreement that is not in the interests of all.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi's words came in response to an agreement signed
Monday by Russia and Kazakhstan to divide the northern part of
Caspian Sea into separate Russian and Kazak sectors.
</P>
<P>
The five nations bordering the world's largest inland water
have been at adds for years over who owns the oil and natural gas
in the seabed.
</P>
<P>
The three nations with oil near their coastlines - Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan - want the water divided into national
sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Russia, two nations with little or no oil near their
Caspian coasts, want equal exploitation of the sea's riches.
</P>
<P>
Russia softened its position to sign the agreement with
Kazakhstan Monday. The deal could open the door for additional
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi urged all the five states to respect the 1996 joint
communique on the Caspian, which calls for joint efforts to
complete the legal regime.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iran's call Monday for a speedup in completing
the legal regime for a fair and equal exploitation of the Caspian
resources.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects UN's Upgrading Palestinian Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Tuesday rejected the
United Nations General Assembly's decision to upgrade the
Palestinian status, saying it contradicts the principles of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This decision creates a negative precedent and contradicts
the principles of the peace process and the spirit of the Oslo
Accords," said a statement issued by the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) of "exploiting the United Nations on matters" that should be
settled by the bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The General Assembly's decision, and its appendix, does not
change the status of the PLO as an organization with observer
status only at the U.N.," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It demanded the PLO not take unilateral actions in the
international arena which would harm the peace process, while
urging the international community not to accept such actions.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly approved an Arab-sponsored resolution early
Tuesday to upgrade the PLO status from an observer to that of a
near statehood. The voting was 124 votes in favor, four against
with 10 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, frustrated by the prolonged impasse in the
peace process, launched the campaign last month to upgrade its
status in the UN. Israel has since been seeking help from
the United States and the European Union in an effort to
prevent the UN from approving such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the U.S. voted against the resolution, arguing
that this would not help revive the peace process.

JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African Labor
Department Tuesday expressed concern about safety standards in
construction industry following the death of 13 workers in the
Bushbuckridge Bridge disaster on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The department said it would investigate if health and safety
standards were violated before the bridge under construction
collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 16.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was being built over the Marite River at Injaka
Dam, about 10 km from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga Province in
northeast South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the Labor Department, in 1997 there were 530
accidents in the construction industry which resulted in 71
deaths.
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that drastic measures are needed to address
this appalling state of affairs," the department said, noting an
investigation will be launched soon to determine the cause of the
Bushbuckridge Bridge disaster.
</P>
<P>
Concor, the company responsible for building the bridge, has
also launched an investigation, as have police forensic experts.

<HEADLINE> Chubais: Decision on IMF Loan to Russia Likely This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's top negotiator with
international monetary organizations said Tuesday that decision on
a stabilization loan to Russia would be made before the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, President Boris Yeltsin's special liaison to
international financial organizations, made the remarks after
meeting Tuesday with officials of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Chubais had said earlier that Moscow needs 10 to 15 billion
U.S. dollars in loans to stabilize the economy and prop up the
ruble, the national currency that is under increasing pressure for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
His remarks helped to ease the plunge in Russian stock markets,
where blue chips tumbled 8-10 percent in the first two hours of
Tuesday against Monday's close. Most of the shares ended the day
down 3-5 percent from their Monday levels.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said he and Martin Gilman, head of the IMF office in
Moscow, Michael Carter, head of the World Bank's office in Moscow,
and Jose Marques-Ruarte, deputy director of the IMF's European II
Department, would meet again at noon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will meet in order to settle the remaining issues and fix
possible differences," Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the credit is very important for Russia, but
it is also clear that we need to make our own efforts, without
which the crisis cannot be overcome."
</P>
<P>
Gilman of the IMF said Tuesday's meeting produced a list of key
problems which Russia, the IMF and the World Bank need to agree on
within the next week.
</P>
<P>
Carter, for his part, urged Moscow to go through serious
structural reform to move the economy forward, saying the World
Bank would do its best to back such efforts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abiola Dead  (more details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's prominent political
detainee Moshood Abiola died of cardiac arrest at 4:00 p.m.
(local time ) Tuesday, at the age of 60, according to a government
statement issued in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was having a meeting with visiting United States
Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, when he started
coughing and was hurried to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Abuja told Xinhua that he died on
the way to hospital .
</P>
<P>
The politician-businessman was widely believed to be winner of
the June 12, 1993 presidential elections. His release has been
seen as of crucial importance to the military government's
transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Last week, visiting United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku said the
military government had agreed to free Abiola very soon, along with
all the other political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who held a private talk with Abiola, said the man
looked hearty and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Some pictures Anyaoku exhibited to newsmen at a press
conference here a week ago showed a smiling Abiola who seemed to
be in good health.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government was expected to announce Abiola's
release any time from Wednesday at the end of the one-month
national mourning for late head of state, General Sani Abacha who
died suddenly of heart attack on June 8.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has reportedly ordered a postmortem
examination to determine the possible causes of Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
The Cable News Network quoted senior U.S. delegation officials
as saying that the death looks like a natural one.
</P>
<P>
But one of Abiola's daughters, Wura Abiola, claimed that she
believed her father was murdered.

<HEADLINE> Falling South African Currency Affects Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
currency Rand's sharp drop against the U.S. Dollar is not only
affecting South African market, but also having a negative impact
on neighboring Swaziland, sources reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hanson Dlamini, Swaziland economic affairs assistant
statistician, said Swaziland's currency, the Emalangeni, was
pinned to the Rand and therefore directly affected by the Rand's
performance on world markets.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Rand has slipped from less than five to
about 6.4 against the Dollar and 10.63 against the British Pound.
</P>
<P>
This poor performance had caused nervousness among many Swazi
businessmen and major industries who feared higher inflation and
job losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We currently export around 80 percent of our goods to South
Africa and we are already nervous about the South African
government's recent decision to charge 14 percent VAT (value
added tax) on goods coming into the country from neighboring
states," Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
"Only imports which are entirely produced in South Africa will
not have any impact on us because the value of the Rand is
equivalent to the Emalangeni."
</P>
<P>
He said Swaziland exported almost 90 percent of its sugar to
countries other than South Africa and would be forced to increase
the price of its exports to counter the effect of hikes in import
prices.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Hand over Rwandan Genocide Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa confirmed Tuesday that the government has a list of
suspects of the 1994 Rwanda genocide who are said to be in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while responding to a question
at a press conference held at the end of Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu's three-day visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said the allegations are being examined and will be
forwarded to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR), based in Arusha in north Tanzania, for appropriate
action.
</P>
<P>
The court was established by the United Nations to try chief
suspects of Rwanda's 1994 genocide. Over 500,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu extremists in a three-month
slaughter that ended with the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic
Front seizing power.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that his government will try its best to
speed up the process of scrutinizing allegations and that the
suspects will be handed over to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"The best I can say is that we are working on the allegations
and relevant steps will be taken against the culprits because we
don't like killers or like to see the slayers walking around our
streets."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu urged people
who fled the country to go back, assuring them that the domestic
situation has improved.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu also welcomed foreign businessmen to invest in his
country, saying the government has taken various measures to
create a conducive investment atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate has lowered to one digit, standing at
around eight percent, he said, adding "We have stabilized the
foreign currency. We have reduced administrative procedures..."
</P>
<P>
He said the country is generally peaceful in spite of isolated
incidents of attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan President stressed that what is happening in his
country cannot be generalized as a situation that security is
deteriorating throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Russia Refutes Charges of Violating CFE Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia Tuesday rejected U.S. charges
that Moscow has departed from its commitments under the
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin made the
remarks in response to a U.S. government report to Congress that
accuses Russia of "handing over Armenia armaments which are
subject to the treaty."
</P>
<P>
"The CFE does not limit or control exports of conventional
armaments," Rakhmanin said. "It merely sets limits of
availability."
</P>
<P>
"The matter is an issue to be considered by the trilateral
Russian-Azerbaijani-Armenian commission," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the report's claim that Russia had stationed
its armed forces in Moldova without the latter's consent.
</P>
<P>
"It is a well-known fact that an agreement on the legal status
of Russian Federation armed forces which are temporarily on
Moldovan territory and on a procedure and schedule for their
withdrawal, although it has not been ratified by the two sides,
has been working normally since 1994," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed "extreme dissatisfaction" with the way the
CFE treaty was being adapted, saying Russia "still has not
received the details of NATO's commitment to refrain from
`additional stationing of substantial combat forces' outside from
the territory of the 16 (NATO member countries)."
</P>
<P>
"There has been no progress on the issue of restrictive
measures for air forces," the spokesman said, noting that it
remained unclear "how, after its expansion, NATO will account for
CFE levels for some categories of conventional armaments."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Insurers Against Illegally Denying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday demanded that health insurance companies abide by a 1996
law that bars them from denying coverage based on pre-existing
conditions when workers change jobs.
</P>
<P>
Making an announcement at the White House, Clinton sent the
message to health insurers: "If you say `no' to people with
pre-existing conditions, the federal government will say `no' to
you."
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed an executive order directing the Office of
Personnel Management to inform insurers covering federal employees
that they must meet all the requirements of the 1996
Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance law or lose their federal
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants to make clear to insurance companies that they
must certify they are complying with the law if they intend to do
business with the federal government. Clinton's order affects 350
health plans offered to federal employees and their families.
</P>
<P>
The president said he was acting out of concern over reports
that some insurance companies were denying health benefits to
people with pre-existing conditions when they changed jobs.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, co-sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a
Democrat, and former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Republican,
people moving from one job to another are supposed to be promptly
eligible for coverage through the new employer if it provides
health benefits to employees.

KAMPALA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations anti-drug

to intensify the country's fight against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Muki Daniel, assistant representative of the United Nations
Drug Control Program for East and Southern Africa, made the
appeal when addressing a cross section of members of the Uganda
Broadcasters Forum (UBROF) here Tuesday afternoon, the Uganda

</P>
<P>
Daniel said the committee should have representatives to

abuse in the east African country, she added.
</P>
<P>
The UBROF President, Samuel Muwanguzi, thanked the U.N. drug
control program for extending financial assistance to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. organization's help has enabled UBROF to open
a sensitization workshop on the hazards of drug abuse and make an
anti-drug abuse television program starting next month.
</P>
<P>
Muwanguzi revealed that his forum has designed a program to
sensitize all students in Uganda about drug abuse and promised to

<P>
KAMPALA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday ended his two-day visit to Eritrea and left for Ethiopia
to continue his search for peaceful resolution to the armed
conflict between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In his brief remarks before leaving Eritrea for Ethiopia
Tuesday morning, Museveni said Uganda supports regional and
international efforts as well as Rwandan government's initiative
to solve the border dispute, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders are additional
to the efforts by the Organization of African Unity, the United
States and Rwanda in this direction, he added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni acknowledged that this visit provides a good
opportunity for him to learn about the causes leading to the
strained relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
When asked by the Ethiopian News Agency how he plans to end
the conflict, Museveni said he had not come with any
pre-conceived ideas but hoped these would emerge during his talks
with the leaders of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was accompanied by First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the hostility between the two neighboring countries
flared into armed conflict along their border area, claiming
lives and causing heavy damages to properties.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, a former Italian and British colony, won independence
from Ethiopia in 1993, making Ethiopia which used to enjoy a

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Rules: Secret Service Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A federal appeals court ruled
Tuesday that three Secret Service employees must tell a grand jury
in the Monica Lewinsky investigation what they observed while
guarding the president.
</P>
<P>
"The order of the District Court compelling the testimony of
Secret Service officers is therefore affirmed," the three-judge
panel ruled, upholding an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The panel rejected the Clinton administration's arguments that
the Secret Service should be exempted from grand jury testimony by
creating a new "protective function privilege," saying it was
Congress' job to decide if such a privilege should exist.
</P>
<P>
"We leave to the Congress the question of whether a protective
function is appropriate in order to ensure the safety of the
president, and, if so, what the contours of that privilege" should
be, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The court also rejected the administration's arguments that
forcing Secret Service officers to testify would increase the risk
of assassination by encouraging a president to push away his
security detail.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was regarded as a major victory for Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, who has been pressing for the testimony of
two Secret Service uniformed officers and one agency lawyer.
</P>

The administration had argued that information that Secret

should not be revealed, and that to force service officers to do
so would jeopardize the future safety of presidents by encouraging
them to push away guardians who might be called to testify.

<HEADLINE> Greece Warns Against Kosovo's Union with Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos warned on Tuesday that threats of military
intervention in the Serbian province of Kosovo by the west are
encouraging secession with Albania.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos, who is on a visit to the United States, told a
press conference here that Greece would oppose the union or
secession of Kosovo with Albanian, saying it would be
"intolerable."
</P>
<P>
"This cannot be tolerated because it leads to a change in
borders, which is extremely dangerous as an idea for the whole of
the area," Tsohatzopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the threats by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) only encourage the Kosovo Liberation Army to
fight on in the hope that the alliance would intervene against
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The role of NATO, he said, must be to encourage negotiations
between Milosevic and Rugova and to discourage any solutions by
military means and the use of violence.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
should hold serious peace talks with Ibrahim Rugova, who has been
recognized by ethnic Albanians as their political leader.

CLAIREFONTAINE, France, July 7 (Xinhua) -- French coach Aime
Jacquet said on Tuesday that the lack of finishing power remained the
main problem for his team.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem with France is with the finishing," said Jacquet,
whose side will play Croatia in the World Cup semifinal in Paris on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is up to the other players to creat better openings
for the attackers, if they could find the composure they need."
</P>
<P>
Jacquet said: "The three biggest threats awaiting the French team
tomorrow are: a lack of concentration, not succeeding in playing our
own game, and losing our lucidity and confidence in our abilities."
</P>
<P>
But the coach blamed the press for "deceiving" the public, saying
"from what they said one would think that France didn't have a team or
a coach."
</P>
<P>
He added: "We are all honored by the fervor that is surrounding us.
We are all very proud to reach the semifinals. I hope that tomorrow
night the last two years of careful preparations will pay their
dividents."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Uncertainty Looms over Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chang Yong)
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The sudden death of Moshood Abiola,
Nigeria's prominent political detainee, has increased the
uncertainty which has already been looming over the most populous
nation in Africa since the death of former head of state Sani
Abacha a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, who has been expected to play a key role in settling
the current political crisis in the country, died Tuesday
afternoon at the age of 60, according to a government statement.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was having a meeting with a United States delegation
headed by Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering in the
capital Abuja, when he started coughing and was hurried to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
He died of cardiac arrest at about 4:00 p.m. local time, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
But sources from Abuja told Xinhua that Abiola died on the way
to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Abiola was the second important figure of the country passing
away within one month.
</P>
<P>
The country's former head of state, late General Sani Abacha,
also died of heart attack on June 8, and a month-long nationwide
mourning has just concluded.
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegation officials were quoted as saying that Abiola's
death looked like a natural one. But one of his daughters, Wura
Abiola, claimed her father was murdered.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has reportedly ordered a postmortem
examination to determine the possible causes of Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
The detained politician-businessman died at a time when people
in and outside the west African country had been waiting for his
release so that he could be playing expected key role in the
military government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's forthcoming release was announced by the new military
government after wide consultations with various interest groups,
including the opposition, and the international community
represented by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
Born on August 24, 1937 in Abeokuta, Ogun State in
southwestern Nigeria, the business mogul married four wives with
many children.
</P>
<P>
As the former presidential candidate of the disbanded Social
Democratic Party, Abiola was widely believed to have won the
presidential elections on June 12, 1993, the first of its kind in
a decade in the west African nation.
</P>
<P>
However, the then military government under General Ibrahim
Babangida announced that the polls had been marred by widespread
irregularities, and annulled the election.
</P>
<P>
After declaring himself head of state and president of a
parallel government, Abiola was arrested by security forces on
June 23, 1994 when he emerged from hiding to attend a rally in
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Campaigns for his release have since been launched both in and
outside Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Like the sudden death of Abacha, the death of Abiola would
also have a great impact on the country's political transition
process.
</P>
<P>
According to Abacha's transition to civil rule program, this
year is the last year of military rule in Nigeria. The handover
date has been fixed for October 1.
</P>
<P>
When Abacha died a month ago, he left the country with no
presidential candidate because he had just been adopted by all
the five political parties as their sole and consensus
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
With the new government led by General Abdulsalam Abubakar
assumed office on June 9, there have been increasing appeals from
both at home and abroad that Abiola be freed to participate in
the political transition program.
</P>
<P>
The opposition in the country even demands that Abiola lead a
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
It was announced last week that Abiola had told Annan that he
would not insist on his presidential candidacy after his release.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean he would not involve in political
activities. And people are still expecting that he would take
part in the remaining part of the transition program by engaging
himself in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Amidst speculations that some secret deals have been done
between Abiola and the military government to solve the country's
political crisis, his sudden death, which came as a shock to many
Nigerians and foreigners, may add uncertainty to the transition
program.

<HEADLINE> EU Offers Provisional Blessing to WorldCom, MCI Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Wednesday
gave a conditional green light to the proposed merger of two
U.S. telecommunications giants, WorldCom and MCI Communications
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, executive arm of the 15-member EU,
demanded total divestiture of MCI's assets in the market of
Internet-related services in return for the clearance.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the commission, which has responsibility for
ensuring fair competition within the single market, came after it
found significant overlaps by the two companies in the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
The two communication giants responded positively with a
proposed package of divestments including all of MCI's Internet
assets to eliminate the overlap in the Internet business.
</P>
<P>
The two companies had previously offered a limited assets sale, but
the commission judged it as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom, the fourth largest U.S. long-distance telephone
company had made an unsolicited bid for MCI, the second largest
U.S. long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
If the merger succeeds, it will create a telecoms giant
second only to AT&AMP;T in size.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Straits Association Vice-President Talks With Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, the vice-president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, in a
meeting with journalists here this afternoon, said that problems
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should be solved by
people on both sides and that this is the Chinese government's
principle.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the two sides have reached a common
understanding on political negotiations which, if it is really
implemented, could mean a more promising future, and he expressed
the hope that people on both sides can seize the opportunity to
promote relations. His organization, ARATS, is willing to hold
discussions with Taiwanese compatriots, whether they agree with
the reunification cause or not, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that ARATS recently received a formal letter from the
Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) proposing a visit by Koo
Chen-fu, its chairman, to the mainland in the autumn. According to
Tang, his organization replied that they hope Mr Koo can visit in
mid-September or mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that, although in recent speeches some
prominent Taiwanese indicated that they do not reject political
negotiations, the letter from SEF did not mention this matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the 'one country, two systems' principle has
been successful in Hong Kong and has gotten praise from around the
globe, it could also be useful in Taiwan, and that, under the 'One
China' principle, his organization is willing to discuss any issue
as long as it facilitates the peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
In a separate matter, Tang said that his organization has given
the four Taiwanese spies who were arrested letters from their
families and other necessary items that were sent, and has
forwarded their replies to their families, which is a humanitarian
service that ARATS is ready and willing to provide.

<HEADLINE> Russian Trade Unions Plan Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia's independent trade unions
are planning a nationwide strike for early October to protest against
government economic policy and to demand President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Wednesday at a conference of the
Federation of Independent Trade Unions (FITU), the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move came amid rising protests around the country where
miners who failed to get their wages for months blocked railways
in Siberia and the far north, costing the economy tens of
millions Roubles.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways said the week-long blockade of the
Trans-Siberian Railroad had cost the country 12.3 million roubles
(about 2.05 million U.S. dollars) in losses.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four cargo trains are now standing idle on the
Trans-Siberian Railroad and many more have been sent along detour
routes. Passenger trains, however, are allowed to pass freely.
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday FITU meeting, participants agreed that the
country was undergoing a profound social and economic crisis and
that trade unions should do their best to prevent a further
decline in living standards.
</P>
<P>
Defense industry workers have also joined the wave of
protests over wage arrears.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Yeltsin's representative in Udmurtia on
Wednesday, union leaders from defense enterprises said the federal
government would have to pay back wages before September or
face "greater activity in demanding the resignation of the
government and the president", Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The open letter said a subsistence income in the region was 409
rubles (about 48 dollars) a month, but the workers got only 100 to
200 rubles (16.6 to 33.3 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Kuchma Agree to Hold Summit in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma agreed Wednesday to meeti
in Kharkov, Ukraine in September.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the prospects of bilateral cooperations on the
phone, the two leaders agreed that the summit, scheduled for
September 18-19, should also involve top government ministers, the
Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's press service said they also discussed ways to step up
economic interaction and implementation of joint projects.
</P>
<P>
It added the Yeltsin-Kuchma conversation took place "in a warm and
friendly atmosphere".
</P>
<P>
The summit is seen as another sign of improving relations between
Moscow and Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma paid his first official visit to Moscow last February
when he and Yeltsin signed a 10-year economic cooperation treaty.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed three agreements on the division of
the Black Sea fleet and a treaty on bilateral friendship and
cooperation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, sticking points still remained. Russia's State Duma,
the lower house of parliament, decided in May to delay discussing
the ratification of the Russian-Ukrainian friendship treaty
because of Kiev's refusal to rule out the possibility of joining
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is adamantly opposed to NATO's eastward expansion.

<HEADLINE> Human Resource Investment Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- There is need for continued
investment in human resources if Zimbabwe is to achieve
sustainable socio-economic development, a cabinet minister said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro made the remarks when she was opening the 1998 institute
of personnel management of Zimbabwe annual convention in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was indisputable that people were the
ingredient for success in any business organization, whether
private or public.
</P>
<P>
''The development of human resources and the subsequent
empowerment will culminate in the establishment of a sound
macro-economic environment and reduce poverty effectively,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Zimbabwe program for economic and social
transformation hinged on increased productivity in the country's
industries, hence the need for upgrading workers' skills, she
said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, a national productivity center should be
established through which government, the private sector and
labor could contribute toward improving productivity, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
She added, ''the involvement of all stake-holders is,
therefore, of paramount importance as envisaged benefits will
cascade to all strata of society.''
</P>
<P>
The two-day convention with the theme of ''the Power of
People'' would, among other issues, discuss the role of human
resources in the current skewed economic environment.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Doctor Wins SAARC Youth Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Najmul Hasnain Shah of
Pakistan has won the SAARC Youth Award-1998 for his discovery
regarding the virulence of hemorrhage septicemia which causes
bacteria of cattle and buffalo, the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery describes the production of vacuolating cytotoxic
activity by pasteurella multocida serotype B and E affecting
macrophages, the secretariat said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It explains why these bacteria are not removed from the blood
and tissues of animals suffering from hemorrhage septicemia, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shah, 30, is a veterinarian at the Center of Animal
Biotechnology Veterinary Research Institute based in Peshawar, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The award carries a gold medal, a cash prize of 500 U.S.
dollars and a citation in English, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
It will be presented to Dr. Shah at the forthcoming session of
the SAARC Council of Ministers slated for July 27-28 in Colombo,
Sri Lanka, the secretariat added.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Youth Awards Scheme was initiated last year with a
view to encouraging the young talent in the member states to excel
in different fields.
</P>
<P>
The first award, presented to a Bangladeshi national in 1997,
was on the theme of "outstanding service in community welfare"
while the current one is under the theme of "new inventions and
discoveries."
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Denounces Seoul's Diplomat Expulsion as Unwarranted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin has condemned South Korea's expulsion of a Russian
diplomat as "absolutely unwarranted".
</P>
<P>
Seoul's action was "an absolutely unwarranted and inequitable
response to what has happened in Russia", Karasin said Wednesday
referring to Moscow's expulsion last week of a South Korean
diplomat accused of espionage.
</P>
<P>
Cho Sung-woo, a councillor of the South Korean embassy, was
caught meeting a top Russian Foreign Ministry official. He was
declared persona non grata Saturday and ordered to leave the
country in 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's expulsion of Oleg Abramkin, first secretary of
the Russian embassy in Seoul, was an apparent retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Karasin, who had informed South Korean Ambassador Lee In-ho
earlier Wednesday of Russia's stance, said it was Seoul that he
held responsible.
</P>
<P>
The move by South Korea was "an unprovoked escalation of
tension in Russian-Korean relations", he said, adding: "The
responsibility for the possible consequences of this decision will
be borne by the Korean side."
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat who was caught meeting Cho was identified
as Valentin Moiseyev, deputy director of the Russian Foreign
Ministry's First Asian Department.
</P>
<P>
Moiseyev was formally taken into custody Monday pending trial
on espionage charges. If convicted of high treason as prescribed
in the Russian Criminal Code, he could face up to 20 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Russia and South Korea established diplomatic ties in 1990 and
have since enjoyed good relations.

<HEADLINE> AL Praises U.N. for Upgrading Palestinian Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Wednesday spoke highly of the resolution passed
by the U.N. General Assembly to upgrade the Palestine's status in
the international body.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Abdel-Meguid described the resolution as
an important step toward the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Arab-sponsored resolution
Tuesday to upgrade Palestine's status from observer to nonvoting
member, which is near statehood.
</P>
<P>
The voting was 124 for, four against, with 10 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the United States and two Pacific island countries -
the Marshall Islands and Micronesia - voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
With new powers at hand, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly and co-sponsor draft
resolutions on Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
But the representatives can not vote or put forward candidates
for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation Arab organization has expressed hopes Tuesday
that the resolution would be followed by similar steps to bring a
just and comprehensive peace to the Middle East.

MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada is expected
to issue within the next two days an order creating a presidential
commission against organized crime which shall oversee the

syndicates.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed Wednesday by Executive Secretary Ronaldo

Zamora said the commission shall include members from some
non-governmental anti-crime institutions to ensure the cooperation
between government law enforcers and the private sector in the
arrest and prosecution of criminals.
</P>
<P>
He said the secretary of interior and local governments is
expected to be named as the head of the commission, whose exact
title has yet to be worked out when the order is finally drafted.
</P>
<P>
As originally envisioned, a task force shall be created to
direct the operations of elements of the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and
other law enforcement agencies, in going after organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the commission will be reporting directly to the

<HEADLINE> China Getting Tougher on Maritime Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Public Security officer
said today that China is prepared to crack down on illegal
maritime activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that on April 26, Chinese border troops seized an oil
tanker, the M.T.Wilby, on the sea near Wenchang on the island
province of Hainan, which was flying the flag of the Republic of
Honduras and was involved in smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, the police discovered that the oil
tanker's real name was the "PETRO RANGER" and that it belonged to
Malaysia and had been hired by a Singaporean company. It had
33 crew members, and 12 were accused by the other 21 of being
hijackers.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, the oil tanker and the 21
crew members were released on May 28, and the 12 accused crew
members are still being detained for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that Chinese police made a special
effort to see to it that the oil tanker would be properly
maintained and that the crew members would be looked after, that
they could have health examinations and receive any medical
treatment they might need, and any other things they might
need.

<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines-U.S. Mutual Defense
Board will hold its first regular meeting Friday in Quezon City in
Metro Manila, a military spokesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Gregorio Fajardo, public information officer of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), said the meeting will be
jointly presided by AFP chief Lt. Gen. Joselin Nazareno and
Admiral Joseph Prueher, U.S. Commander-in-Chief for the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Fajardo said the defense board would discuss the regional
security situation, bilateral cooperative activities and the
results of a joint security seminar between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The board was created in May 1958 as provided for by the
Philippines-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty signed in August 1951.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the board has been conducting meetings on a regular
basis in Honolulu and Manila respectively.
</P>
<P>
The board is aimed at encouraging direct liaison and
consultation between the two countries on military matters of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Fajardo said the board would serve as a forum for the
coordination of bilateral activities such as joint training
exercises, humanitarian assistance, relief operations during

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Strategic Dialog With U.S. Wide-Ranging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Wednesday that the Egyptian-American strategic dialog in
Washington starting Friday would not be limited to discussions of
U.S. economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Expressing hope for the success of the talks, Moussa told an
Egyptian Television program that it would tackle not only the
current bilateral economic relationship, but also various spheres
of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"It is not right for the dialog to be limited to the next five
or 10 years of U.S. assistance to Egypt," he told "Good Morning
Egypt" program Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian economy is progressing and is moving away from
dependence on foreign aid toward self reliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
But like several other Egyptian ministers who have visited
Washington in the past few weeks, Moussa is most likely to discuss
how to use the U.S. economic aid to serve Egypt's switch to market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is considering cutting this aid according to its
policy of reducing foreign economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, as the first Arab country to seal peace with Israel,
gets a total of 815 million U.S. dollars in U.S. economic aid and
1.3 billion dollars in military aid every year.
</P>
<P>
The economic relationship with the U.S. is a key relationship,
Moussa said. "The U.S. is a big market and a strong ally in the
global economy, and it is beneficial to have an active and
positive U.S.-Egyptian relationship."
</P>
<P>
Moussa is to arrive in Washington Thursday and talk with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on creating a fast
communication channel between the U.S. State Department and the
Egyptian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said the dialog with the U.S. involves two aspects,
bilateral and regional.
</P>
<P>
At the bilateral level, Egypt is to open door for trade with
the U.S., and to increase investments in many fields. There are
other issues such as transfer of technology, and scientific,
educational and cultural relations, which will be discussed,
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, Moussa said the realization of Middle East
peace, which is Egypt's main interest, will be tackled. If the
process that was agreed upon in the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference
was steered off course, he said, "it is our task now to put it
back on track."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is becoming totally aware of the different aspects of
the current situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We all want peace, and we will turn the page when Palestinian
land is restored, their political rights are regained and Israel
and Arab countries receive their security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa met here Tuesday with Albright's envoy, Greg Craig, who
came to add final touches on the preparation for the upcoming
Egypt-U.S. strategic dialog in Washington.

HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Rapid population growth presents a
challenge to African countries which must provide health care,
housing, schools, employment and food for an increasing number of
people, a Zimbabwean minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a media workshop on population and
development here, Zimbabwean Minister of Information, Posts and
Telecommunications Chen Chimutengwende challenged communication
agencies to highlight implications of population dynamics.
</P>
<P>
"The shortcomings have now caught up with us and manifest
themselves with the characteristic pressure on almost all
resources," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He told journalists and other attendants that the world's
population growth is alarming and that the situation remains out
of control despite the implementation of sound population
policies by governments.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 97 percent of the increase in population for
the next 60 years would be in developing countries, while 34
percent is expected to be contributed by Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop was funded by United Nations Population
Fund.

<HEADLINE> Centralized Foreign Investment Board Proposed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Merchant
Banks in Malaysia (AMBM) has proposed the setting up of a
Centralized Foreign Investment Board along with other remedies and
strategies to actively bring back foreign investments into the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum submitted to the Ministry of Finance's ongoing
1999 Budget Dialogue Wednesday, AMBM said the setting up of the
one-stop centralized foreign investment board would serve not only
as a marketing and promotions authority but also act as a
centralized coordinator catering to foreigners wishing to invest
in any sector, thus playing a crucial role in the revival of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that the Foreign Investment Committee now be
reconstituted to carry out this role.
</P>
<P>
AMBM said that there was a capital outflow of about 20 billion
ringgit (5 billion U.S. dollars) from the country from mid-1997 to
end-1997 and added that reversing the capital outflow would lead
to a reversal in the depreciating trend of the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
It would also restore much needed funding to the economy and
therefore give rise to a sustainable reduction in interest rates,
it said.
</P>
<P>
AMBM said that the capital inflow would restore confidence,
stimulate the economy and strengthen the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Towards this end, AMBM said there is a need to address various
misperceptions about Malaysia's attitude to foreign investors and
ease the flow of accurate information on foreign investments
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Other measures proposed to attract foreign investments are the
promulgation of clear guidelines on foreign equity participation
and ownership, especially those related to property, clarifying
the issue of divestment of foreign owned assets to local entities
and removing bureaucratic bottlenecks, AMBM said.
</P>
<P>
It said the government should also consider reviewing the
existing framework for foreign venture capital companies to be
based in Malaysia and strengthening tax incentives relating to the
inflow of foreign capital and repatriation and reinvestment of
profits and the length of time foreign capital remains in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The key macroeconomic strategies should be targeted at reducing
the real and perceived risk premium on Malaysia, AMBM said, adding
that the pivotal requirement of this is the undertaking of a
systematic and meticulously outlined resolution of the large
domestic stock of outstanding debt.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Sets Minimum Reserves Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
has decided to require minimum reserves from commercial banks to
help steer interest rates and money supply for the 11 founding
countries of the single European currency, the euro, which is to
be launched next year.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the monthly meeting of ECB's governing
council in Frankfurt Tuesday, ECB president Wim Duisenberg said in
Frankfurt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, commercial banks are obliged to set aside a
certain percentage of their deposits at the central bank each
month, paving the way for the central bank to monitor bank lending
and fine tune money supply in the market.
</P>
<P>
The exact ratio of the required minimum reserves will be set
this autumn and could fall between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent,
said Duisenberg.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has met with reservations from some experts
fearing it would lead to less competitiveness among European
commercial banks against their U.S. counterparts which carry no
minimum reserves demand.
</P>
<P>
Defending the plan, Duisenberg said the ECB would pay interest
to commercial banks on their reserves lodged at the central bank
to offset the possible disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
The decision is viewed as a victory for the powerful German
central bank, the Bundesbank, which has persistently lobbied for
the system to ensure the stability of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland will launch the
euro in January next year.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Denmark have opted out of the first wave for the
euro, while Greece and Sweden were judged by the E.U. not
economically ready to join.

ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirate (UAE) has decided to
postpone 35 percent of the projects that should have been
implemented from 1998 to 2002 for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The UAE Planning Department said the projects need over 24
billion dirhams (6.5 billion U.S. dollars) while oil earnings
which constitute about 90 percent of the country's revenues
dropped dramatically due to sagging prices.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Trade volume between Jordan and Saudi Arabia has
jumped to 224 million dinars (about 316 million dollars) in 1997
from 80 million dinars (113 million dollars) in 1989, a report
released by the Amman Chamber of Industry Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's trade with Saudi Arabia represented 20 percent of its
total with Arab states in 1997, six percentage points up as
compared with 1989.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to Saudi Arabia accounted for 25 percent of
its total last year, as against 20 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian government has received three offers from the
Netherland, the U.S. and Australia for the construction and
management of the east Port Said harbor, which will cost 1.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian side will pay 40 percent of the cost, and foreign
companies bear the rest.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The final touches will soon be completed for the
signing of an agreement on the opening of the first navigation
line to link Egypt directly with Russian ports and harbors in the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language daily Alam Al Yom said Wednesday that the
project, which needs an investment of 40 million dollars, aims to
facilitate Egyptian exports.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia will host a two-day international conference
on July 14-16 to boost cooperation between African and Asian
countries.
</P>

Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Puts More Money for Intelligent City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government has
approved an additional 600 million ringgit (150 million U.S.
dollars) for the development of its Cyberjaya, the world's first
intelligent city.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya, a multi-million ringgit project, is part of
Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a 750 square kilometer
zone south of Kuala Lumpur designated as a hub for the development
of multimedia products and services.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday the
allocation reaffirmed the government's commitment to seeing the
MSC project through despite the current downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The additional allocation is expected to be drawn from the
5-billion ringgit (1.25 billion U.S. dollars) Infrastructure Fund
announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim last week, who had said that the fund would ensure that
provision of all basic infrastructure for the MSC would be on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The government is fully committed to the development of the
MSC and all the money we can afford will go into the project and
it will take off," Mahathir was quoted by Malaysia's national news
agency Bernama as saying after closing a conference on the MSC
here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described the MSC as a very important project for the
country and a logical step to take after attaining
industrialization, pledging "We are going ahead with the project."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir called on local small and medium scale information
technology companies to take advantage of the low cost in setting
up base within the MSC.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign participants are also welcomed. "We have always
laid out the welcome mat for them and we have been a good host,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said technologies and their applications were moving
so fast so much so that Malaysians needed to equip themselves to
face such development.

<HEADLINE> Half A Million People Visit China's New Commodity Market Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A website belonging to China's
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on the
Internet was visited 60,000 times on July 1, the first day it
opened.
</P>
<P>
There were 114,000 visits to the "China Market" site on
Tuesday, Ministry officials reported today. According to Xing Wei,
director of MOFTEC's China International Electronic Commerce
Center (CIECC), in the past week it was visited 562,000 times by
people from the United States, Canada, Japan, and dozens of other
countries and some regions.
</P>
<P>
"China Market" can be reached at http://www.chinamarket.com.cn
and MOFTEC can be reached at its official web site
http://www.moftec.gov.cn.
</P>
<P>
Xing Wei explains that "China market" has 6 major product
categories: electronics and machinery; textiles; light industry
and crafts; foodstuffs, native produce, and animal by-products;
hardware, minerals, and chemicals; and medicine and nutritional
products.
</P>
<P>
CIECC's Ma Yun says that businesses have been active on the
website but no deals are known to have been concluded so far.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng says that he believes that the website is a solid step
by China to move into the age of e-commerce. The United Nations'
International Telecommunication Union estimates that the world
could do 50 billion U.S. dollars worth of e-commerce this year,
and 300 billion by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> State-owned Enterprises Warned Against Brain Drain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Experts with the China Association
of Science and Technology today suggested that the state-owned
enterprises (SOE) should exercise controls on the number of
layoffs among their scientific staff members to avoid a brain
drain in their future development.
</P>
<P>
A survey, released by the association in Beijing today, showed
that in more than 400 SOEs surveyed across the country, people 50
and below accounted for more than two-thirds of the total number
of laid-off scientific workers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it will be beneficial to enterprises if they
give advanced training to young laid-off workers because they may
become the backbone of the future scientific work with improved
skills and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that the problem of laid-off
scientific staff members has plagued two-thirds of the SOEs
surveyed, and about 41 percent of those enterprises with good
economic returns still have the problem. The number of laid-off
scientific workers has already made up 5 percent of the total
scientific staff, or 5.7 percent of the total laid-off workers in
the 400 SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment of the laid-off scientific personnel seems
more difficult than that of the normal laid-off workers, since
most of the former do not want to find jobs in other cities or in
non-state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments at all levels should help laid-off
scientific workers change the traditional concept of working in
the same unit for their whole lives and encourage them to get new
starts in other units or in new careers, said Zhou Guangzhao,
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress, and chairman of the China Association for
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
He said the association will take it as a major task for this
year to help laid-off scientific workers find employment.

<HEADLINE> Coronary Artery Disease High in South Asia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Coronary artery disease that
reduces blood supply to the heart muscle and can lead to heart
attacks is more widespread in South Asia than other regions, said
a report in the recent issue of Current Science Journal.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that South Asians in general are most prone to
coronary artery disease than other ethnic groups, said J. Dhawan
and S. Petkar from the Seunthorpe General Hospital in the United
Kingdom in the report published by the journal.
</P>
<P>
South Asians tend to develop the disease manifestations at an
earlier age and respond less well to treatment.
</P>
<P>
Studies in India suggest that prevalence of coronary artery
disease is 10 percent, four times higher than that of the United
States and similar to other South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Prevalence of the disease in rural India, where incidence is
much lower than in urban regions, is twice that of the United
states.
</P>
<P>
The two Indian scholars said in their report that South Asians
tend to suffer more from diabetes, higher insulin levels,
abdominal obesity, and lower levels of physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
While the exact cause of the higher mortality rate in South
Asians is yet to be determined, both genetic and environmental
factors play a role, the report said.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Confident of Overcoming Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said here Wednesday
that the Airport Authority will be able to overcome the running-in
difficulties in the next few days and deliver back to the Hong
Kong people a world class airport.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions concerning the problems occurring at
the new Hong Kong International Airport since its commercial
operation on July 6, Tsang said that the Airport Authority had a
long period of running in and trial before the opening of the
airport, which was originally scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
"We must realize those trials were in very contrived
conditions, not tested with the number of passengers we handled
yesterday, and the amount of cargo. So it was a bit unlucky, and
the computer had a little bit of problem for them," the financial
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Since its opening Monday, there has been chaos at the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok mainly in flights display board, cargo
operation and broken-down auxiliary facilities. The most serious
problem now is cargo delay.
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, Tsang said that the Airport Authority has
been trying its very best. "They have been working day and night
and from the report I have received there have been very marked
improvements already over the last two days, particularly this
morning compared with yesterday," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure they'll be able to overcome this running-in
difficulties in the next few days. And we'll have to be fair too.
It is a first class airport. It's one of the largest airports in
the world... I'm sure they (the Airport Authority) are going to
deliver back to us the Hong Kong people a first class airport in
the next few days," Tsang noted.

<HEADLINE> China Examines 20,000 Prosecutors, Anti-Corruption Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide campaign has been
launched to scrutinize the conduct of China's 20,000 leading
officials working at county- and city-level procuratorates and
anti-corruption bureaus.
</P>
<P>
"The major target will be focused on chief prosecutors and
heads of anti-corruption bureaus," according to a circular
distributed during a national tele-conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The circular was jointly issued in June by the Organization
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (CPC)
of China and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. This
investigation is expected to be completed by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
This campaign was launched in response to directives given by
top Chinese leaders on preventing and curbing corruption inside
law-enforcement departments and to the "many pertinent opinions
and suggestions" put forward by delegates to the National People's
Congress earlier this year on procuratorial work, said Li Tielin,
deputy head of the CPC Central Committee Organization Department.
</P>
<P>
These officials will be checked for their political and
ideological quality, working style, self-discipline and honesty,
law-enforcement proficiency level, and procedures by which they
were elected and appointed, as well as the situations in the
departments under their charge, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, they will be asked to report on their own
work, and will be examined by their subordinates, deputies to
local people's congresses and party committees.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of the inspection campaign, which covers 3,700 local
procuratorates and anti-corruption bureaus, and the number of
people involved, up to 20,000, are unprecedented," said Li,
the Organization Department official.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Kehui, deputy prosecutor-general of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, city- and county-level procuratorates make
up 99 percent of the total number of prosecuting bodies in the
country, whose prosecutors account for 93 percent of the nation's
total, handling 95 percent of all criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
The leading officials of these bodies play a vital role in
safeguarding justice, she said.
</P>
<P>
Both Li and Hu told the tele-conference that the campaign,
under specialized leading groups in the localities, must avoid
perfunctory and superficial gestures, and expose real problems in
an effort to improve the working style and law-enforcement
proficiency of prosecuting bodies.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Sudan have agreed
to establish sea and air links, Malaysian Transport Minister Ling
Liong Sik said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed upon during talks between him and Sudanese
Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail here, he told reporters
later.
</P>
<P>
Ling said Malaysian and Sudanese officials and representatives
of both airlines would finalize the details within a month before
ratifying an air-link agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ling said for a start, their respective national flag carriers
-- Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Sudan Air -- would exchange
passengers at Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed that Sudan Air can sell MAS tickets
for traffic to Malaysia and beyond and likewise MAS can sell
tickets for Sudan-bound traffic and beyond, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
Ling said he explained to Mustafa the need for establishing air
links between the two countries because many Asians working in
Sudan would need an efficient air service to cater for their
traveling needs.
</P>
<P>
On sea links, Ling said both countries would encourage cargo
shipment from Port Klang, Malaysia, to Sudan especially through
the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa arrived here Monday on a five-day visit to Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Both Israel's inner cabinet and
the wider security cabinet convened Wednesday morning, but no
decision was taken concerning the further redeployment in the West
Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the inner cabinet, which groups Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky, was the first in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Both meetings took place following speculation in Israel that
a decision on the second withdrawal from the West Bank is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu spoke on telephone with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday night to
discuss the redeployment. It quoted "senior sources" in Jerusalem
as saying that Israel and the U.S. have narrowed their gaps "on a
number of issues" although key differences remain.
</P>
<P>
The report has coincided with remarks made recently both by the
U.S. and Israeli officials that an Israeli decision on the second
redeployment, which they said would help bring a breakthrough in
the deadlocked peace process, will be taken soon.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Tuesday
that U.S. President Bill Clinton, Albright and Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross "have all been actively involved" in trying to
break the stalemate in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Monday night that she had had intensive
telephone contacts with Netanyahu in recent days and tried to
work it issue by issue. "I think we are coming closer," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, Netanyahu contended Tuesday that the differences
which plagued his government's intermittent dealings with the
U.S. have been virtually resolved. Mordechai said a cabinet
decision on the redeployment could be made "within days."
</P>
<P>
The boldest prediction came from the Israeli newspaper the
Jerusalem Post, which on Wednesday quoted "a source" as saying
that at a forthcoming meeting, the inner cabinet would give a
conditional approval for the U.S. initiative calling for a 13
percent withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the ministers were likely to approve the
withdrawal package as long as the Palestinians agree to
Netanyahu's demands, including the arrest of terrorists and the
convening of the Palestinian National Council for the formal
revision of the Palestinian Covenant which calls for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian National Authority issued a statement
Tuesday rejecting the terms set by the Israeli prime
minister.

economy cannot take us anywhere," Muluzi said. "Donors will only
help if ourselves are in the forefront in forging developmental
endeavors."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges US, EU to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has urged the United States and the European
Union (EU) to lift their sanctions against Nigeria, which he said
has seriously affected the livelihood of ordinary Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the call Tuesday in Nigerian capital Abuja,
where he held talks with a high-level U.S. government delegation
headed by Thomas Pickering, the Under-secretary of State for
Political Affairs and former ambassador to the most populous
country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also includes General James Jamerson, Deputy
Commander of the U.S. European Command; Susan Rice, Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs and several other senior
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar told the U.S. visitors that time is now ripe for the
various sanctions to be lifted as the livelihood of the Nigerians
is at stake.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has done a lot in the areas of drug control and
fighting against financial crimes to be considered for
certification, Abubakar said, adding that it is time for Nigeria
and the U.S. to reestablish air links and normalize their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian head of state assured that he would continue to
encourage the participation of all Nigerians in the social and
political transition process, irrespective of their political
persuasions.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said he would strengthen the ongoing consultations to
ensure that no viewpoint is ignored as no useful purpose would be
served by alienating groups just because of their views.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Pickering reportedly said the composition of
his group is a reflection of the importance the U.S. government
attached to the need to develop a close working relationship with
Nigeria, which he described as a great country.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said his government was pleased by the steps already
taken by Abubakar, referring to the release of some political
detainees and the pledge to continue the transition to democracy,
but he made it clear that there would be still a long way to go
in normalizing the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He commended the Nigerian military's role in peace-keeping
operations in various parts of the world, and urged Nigeria not
to miss the chance of playing a significant role not only in
Africa but also in the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the media at the end of the meeting from 10:30
a.m. to 12:35 a.m., Pickering said that "it was an extremely
productive and very informative meeting with the head of state."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other Western nations imposed sanctions on
Nigeria after the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential
election and stepped up their sanctions further in 1993 after the
hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists by
the Nigerian government on charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include among others visa restrictions on senior
government officials, cut of air links, ban on sale of arms and
stoppage of training of Nigerian military officers.

<HEADLINE> EU to Reduce Air Pollution From LCPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission proposed
on Wednesday new limits for emissions of certain pollutants from
large combustion plants (LCPs).
</P>
<P>
The new limits for emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides and dust are twice as strict as the existing ones and will
apply to all new installations put into operation after January 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposal enlarged the emission limitation to
include gas turbines and to set limits for nitrogen oxide
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to encourage the use of combined heat
and power generation in new large combustion plants.
</P>
<P>
This form of generation is a technique that allows the use more
than 80 percent of the fuel's potential energy, compared with just
35 to 50 percent energy consumption in traditional techniques.
</P>
<P>
The extra costs resulting from the new limit values were
estimated to be at less than 2 billion European currency units
(ECU) over the first 10 years after their introduction.
</P>
<P>
The LCPs, with a capacity threshold of 50 megawatts, include
mostly large boilers used for the production of steam.
</P>
<P>
Around 500 power stations account for two thirds of the power
capacity of LCPs in the European Union while the other third is
divided among up to 2,000 installations on industrial sites in the
EU.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in S. Africa Hits 5-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
confidence plunged to its worst level in five years last month
amid turmoil caused by the falling Rand, high interest rates and
a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The Star newspaper Wednesday quoted the South African Chamber
of Commerce (Sacob) as saying that its business confidence index
dropped 5.7 points to 92.2 points in June against 97.9 points in
May. The index was unchanged at 99.1 in April.
</P>
<P>
"The recent speculation against the Rand and the concomitant
threat to financial stability emphasizes the vulnerability of
South Africa's financial markets in light of the country's
emerging market status and its balance of payments constraints,"
Sacob's Director-General Raymond Parsons said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Rand staged a surprise recovery to 6.10 Rand to one U.S.
Dollar Tuesday, after slumping to 6.75 Rand at its historic low
against the U.S. Dollar. It has lost over 30 percent of its
value against the U.S. Dollar since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
As South African Reserve Bank repeatedly hiked its lending
rate to save the Rand, commercial banks followed suit. The
country's major banks have raised their prime lending rates three
times since June 11, from 18.25 percent up to about 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mike Schussler, an economist, said: "It was expected that the
weaker Rand and increases in interest rates would knock business
confidence. The biggest problem is if the Asian crisis continues
and drags South Africa and our neighbors along."
</P>
<P>
The country was probably closer to the bottom of the business
cycle than a few months ago, Schussler said, adding that things
would change by the end of the year, with economic growth picking
up and more jobs being created.
</P>
<P>
Sacob maintained its growth forecast for the year at 1.5
percent and inflation at 5.8 percent. The government's growth
target for the year is 2.5 percent, according to the chamber of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Sacob's director-general said that he expected speculators
to maintain their attack on the Rand for a few months.

named his starting line-up in the match against France, the same one
he used in defeating Germany in quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Blazevic's decision is reasonable as the team beat Germany so

</P>

But that means there is still no place for Robert Prosincki.

Blazevic said he believed Zvonimir Boban might hold the key to
the match:"His is our best player. He is the symbol of the Croatia
team." Blazevic said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 business people and
experts from Hong Kong and Beijing gathered here today to attend a
symposium on trade and service cooperation between the two places.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium, the participants discussed and exchanged
views on the development of the public-service industry, the
management of tourism and hotels, the information industry and
infrastructure construction and real estate management in the two
metropolitan cities.
</P>
<P>
According to Yi Xiqun, director of the Beijing Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Commission, Beijing has focused on
developing the service industry in recent years. The revenue from
the service industry last year accounted for 53.8 percent of the
city's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Last year, Beijing earned 3.88 billion U.S. dollars from
foreign trade, but its hard currency income from non-trade sectors
reached 5.12 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yi said Beijing has great potential to tap its service industry
and has a lot to learn from Hong Kong in this respect. He said he
hoped the symposium would increase exchange and cooperation
between the two places.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by Beijing Foreign Trade and

<P>
Israel is under pressure from the United States and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to accept an American peace
initiative in a bid to break the deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which PNA has formally accepted, calls on
Israel to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank in
the second redeployment in return for the fulfillment of the
Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said on Tuesday that a peace agreement would be
reached in the near future if the PNA took necessary measures to
ensure the security of Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also noted early
this week that the peace process is progressing and the Israeli
government may make a decision on the further redeployment
soon.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Criticizes Some Ministers' Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government criticized
some of its ministers Wednesday for making statements concerning
the country's pre-supposed situation.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Myanmar Foreign Ministry
issued here Wednesday evening, the authorities said the ministers'
statements are found to be presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
However, the press release did not disclose on what issues the
ministers have made the statements.
</P>
<P>
"The Myanmar authorities have been exercising utmost restraint
in dealing with the aggressive and confrontational attitude of
certain elements with the hope of inviting outside interference in
the internal political development," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities will continue in exercising careful and
measured steps to safeguard and protect the stability as well as
constructive building of a system which the government has
committed to build with discipline," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities expressed regret that the ministers'
"presumptuous observation and remarks made on isolated and wrong
information could lead to misunderstanding and misconception not
only in bilateral relations but also in intra-ASEAN perceptions
which are against the inherent and ultimate objectives of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as a whole," the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
According to another official Information Sheet available here
Wednesday, "rumors have also been disseminated about imminently
spontaneous social unrest in Myanmar. The media and some
governments have also been engaged to believe that disturbances
and violence are to be expected on Martyr's Day (July 19) or
August 8 (the 10th anniversary of the 1988 incident)."

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Equal Exploitation of Caspian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday reiterated that a legal regime should be formulated for
the Caspian Sea and its littoral states should exploit the
resources on equal bases.
</P>
<P>
Before seeing Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov off at the
end of his three-day visit, Khatami said the Caspian Sea belongs
to the littoral states -- Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and
Turkmenistan -- and it should be a place for peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov's visit focused on the exploitation of the Caspian
resources, mainly oil, after Kazakhstan and Russia Monday signed
an agreement to divide the northern part of the sea between them.
</P>
<P>
Iran is not opposed to a fair share of the seabed resources by
the littoral states, Khatami said, stressing that any change in
the existing legal regime of the sea must be endorsed by the five
countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Kazakh-Russian agreement, Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on Tuesday that Iran
would not recognize any bilateral agreements aimed at dividing the
Caspian Sea for exploiting its resources.
</P>
<P>
The five nations bordering the world's largest inland water
have been at odds for years over the ownership of the oil and
natural gas in the seabed.
</P>
<P>
The three nations with oil near their coastlines -- Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan -- want the water divided into
national sectors so they can claim the oil for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Russia, two nations with little or no oil near their
Caspian coasts, want equal exploitation of the sea's resources.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Bank Develops Agent Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) has reported success in developing its agent
business for the country's young policy banks, a bank official
said.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC, China's largest bank, had now functioned as agents
for 584 projects financed by the State Development Bank (SDB), the
country's largest policy bank, founded in 1994 to finance the
construction of major national projects. The ICBC has acted as
agents in business transactions valued at 84.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC has also maintained excellent business relations with
the Export and Import Bank of China (EximBank), a policy-oriented
bank set up in 1994 to finance China's exports of capital goods
such as machinery, electronics and other equipment. So far,
EximBank has entrusted ICBC to act as agents for 30 export
projects with a total value of 3.3 billion yuan, about
one-third of EximBank's total business entrusted to other banks.
</P>
<P>
"Working as agents for the policy banks has both solved the
policy banks' problem of lacking operational subsidiaries and
settlement means and enabled us to expand our own business," an
ICBC official said.
</P>
<P>
ICBC has a wide subsidiary network across China and in many
large cities around the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Difficult to Meet Inflation Target: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The rebasing of the consumer price
index and the subsequent change in the inflation target will make
it more difficult for the Philippine government to meet its
inflation target and perhaps other economic targets set with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
This was the apprehension expressed Wednesday by Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson following the adjustment in the inflation
computation which now makes the inflation level much higher.
</P>
<P>
Singson pointed out that the inflation target set under the
Precautionary Arrangement with the IMF used the base year of 1988
and therefore projected an average inflation range this year of
between 7.5 percent and 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the National Statistics Office rebased its inflation
computation in May this year from the year 1988 to 1994 and will
officially use 1994 as the base year starting in August.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that it would be difficult to recompute the figure
earlier submitted to the IMF especially since the central bank
does not normally compute the inflation figures.
</P>
<P>
If the inflation numbers are skewed, Singson added, all other
assumptions for the macroeconomic targets may similarly be
affected and thus prevent the country from meeting its targets.
</P>
<P>
Singson suggested that the statistics office continue to issue
two inflation rates, one based in 1988 and the other using 1994,
until the end of the year so that the central bank can still
verify that it is meeting its targets with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Singson was confident that if the inflation rate still uses the
base year of 1988, the government would still be able to meet its
inflation target set with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Reasons Behind Booming Restaurant Business in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Extravagance and waste at public
expense represent the two major factors contributing to the
booming restaurant sector in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province,
according to today's edition of Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, a city with three million urban residents and a
transient population of 500,000 workers, has over 15,000
restaurants, or one for every 240 people.
</P>
<P>
The city's restaurants, including the most expensive, are
thriving in spite of their large number in the city.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Meiyuan Restaurant in the Jinling Hotel, the
city's only five-star hotel, generates a daily turnover of 40,000
yuan (4,819 US dollars), with the Seafood Restaurant on the
Jianianhua Club earning 120,000 yuan daily.
</P>
<P>
Reporters visited several restaurants and found that many
customers were discussing business over dinner, with some 80
percent paying for meals with either credit cards or checks.
</P>
<P>
They also found extensive waste in terms of uneaten food and
partially filled drink containers, including many expensive items.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that Nanjing is not only one of the
nation's fastest growing areas, but is also home to many
enterprises with financial problems and has a huge number of
laid-off workers. "The city's economic development calls for
practicing thrift. Please drink less alcohol, and work more,"
according to the report.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong (CMA) held a reception here Wednesday to
celebrate the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and other principal officials of the
SAR government, officials of the institutions of the Central
Government in the SAR, foreign consuls in Hong Kong and leading
figures of the local business community attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the function, CMA President Herbert Liang said that
although Hong Kong faces a difficult situation at present due to
the Asian financial crisis, it still retained its solid economic
fundamentals one year after it returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who visited Hong Kong respectively in the past week,
spoke highly of the achievements Hong Kong had made in the past
year and expressed their confidence in the future development of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During their visits to Hong Kong, President Jiang assured the
Hong Kong people that the Central Government will provide its full
support to the SAR and President Clinton said Hong Kong will be
among the first economies in the region to recover from the
financial crisis, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that after a period of adjustment, Hong
Kong will become more competitive, the economy will further
develop on a healthier basis and the adjustment will help Hong
Kong build a more solid economic foundation and put Hong Kong into
a new phase of development in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Indian Geologists Claim to Find Smallest Fossil Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Indian geologists claimed to
find for the first time the smallest fossil eggs dating back to
225 million years, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
What makes the finding unique is that the eggs are microscopic,
soft-shelled belonging to the late Gondwana Age, PTI quoted D. P.
Das and P. M. Datta as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fossil eggs of dinosaurs, birds and reptiles collected so far
are large, hard-shelled and two million to 180 million years ago,
belonging to the Pleistocene to the Upper Triassic Era.
</P>
<P>
The nest of eggs discovered from the south Rewa Gondwana Basin
in the central Madhya Pradesh shows remarkable similarity in shape
and structure to recent fish eggs, the two scientists from the
Geological Survey of India in Calcutta reported in the recent
issue of Current Science Journal.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said though the fossil eggs did not show any
specific features, they were similar in structure to fossil eggs
of ampharyngodon mola, a fish of recent times.
</P>
<P>
The new fossil eggs are, however, smaller than ampharyngodon
eggs, according to the geologists.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 24 people have been killed
and about 400,000 people have had to abandon their homes due to
mud slides and flooding triggered by heavy rains over the past
five days in southeastern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were the result of house collapse and mud slides in
the city of Chittagong and the hill districts in the region,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 people have been injured and 20,000 hectares of paddy
fields damaged, they said.
</P>
<P>
"An exact assessment of loss is not possible at this moment,"
Abul Bashar, an agriculture officer said.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall has lessened since Tuesday and the situation is
expected to improve soon, weather officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further damage if the rainfall stops," they
said.
</P>
<P>
The roads linking Chittagong and the resort town of Cox's
Bazar, and between Chittagong and the hill tracts have been
reportedly cut off as some sections of the roads have gone under
water.
</P>
<P>
An official in Cox's Bazar confirmed the deaths of 12 persons
in his district, saying the figure might go up as reports from
remote areas were not available at present.
</P>
<P>
Low-lying areas in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and hill districts
of Bandarban, Khagrachari, still remained flooded and thousands of
people were made homeless, a report said.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's duty-free maquiladora zone
is attracting a growing number of Canadian manufacturers, "The
Globe and Mail" newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the North American free-trade agreement took effect in 1994,
the number of Canadian-owned duty-free maquiladora plants has more
than tripled to 30 from nine, and they now employ more than 10,000
Mexicans, according to the survey of Canada's participation in the
Mexican trade scheme.
</P>
<P>
The study by the U.S. International Trade Commission also found that
the vast majority of the companies' products are then exported to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the maquiladora plan, companies can import any parts they
need, use cheap Mexican labor to assemble their products and then pay
duty only on the value added in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian plants are heavily concentrated in the automotive,
electronics and textile industries.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 350 Canadian companies in Mexico, but fewer
than 10 percent of those operate under the maquiladora plan.

DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The private sectors of Bangladesh and
Myanmar have agreed to set up a special processing zone as a joint
venture in Cox's Bazar district in the southeastern part of this
South Asian nation, the national BSS news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the private sector investors had sought
initiatives from their respective governments in this regard,
President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI)
Maksud Khan was quoted by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for a decision from the governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
A DCCI business promotion delegation during a recent visit to
Myanmar discussed with Myanmar industrialists and businessmen on
measures for expanding bilateral trade and investment, and made
recommendations to governments of the two countries for
implementation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar had a vast reserve of forests -- bamboo and soft timber
for paper and pulp, and mineral resources like limestone and
clinker for cement industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The finished products from the zone would be exported to other
countries including Myanmar to the benefit of both countries,
considering the economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar by some
countries, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is one of Bangladesh's two close neighbors, but trade
between the two countries has remained small in volume.

</P>
<P>
The statement said the prediction was reported "without
offering any scientific methods," terming it as void of any
scientific validity.
</P>
<P>
Due to the complexity of factors behind earthquakes, no
reliable scientific body has been able to predict the precise
location and time of a quake, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Tehran citizens have rushed to buy daily
necessities for fear of possible earthquakes.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market closed
marginally higher Wednesday as the government-backed takeover of a
local gas distributor Allgas Energy dominated an otherwise
directionless day of trading.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said there were no clear trends guiding trade as the
all ordinaries index closed 4.8 points stronger at 2,774.1.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial Average closed 6.8 points lower
Tuesday night at 9,085.0 but a stronger performance on Asian
markets helped the local market's confidence Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's turnover reached 248.4 million shares, worth 651
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Allgas shares topped the value table with 5.92 million shares
changing hands worth 84 million U.S. dollars as they closed at
1.28 Australian dollars, or just under six percent, higher at
23.00 Australian dollars.
</P>

The Allgas takeover overshadowed a record breaking rise in
Commonwealth Bank of Australia shares Wednesday, which climbed
27.9 Australian cents firmer to 19.97 Australian dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Above 62 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed above
62 U.S. cents for the first time in more than a week Wednesday as
financial markets held their breath in anticipation of market
friendly news from Japan.
</P>
<P>
John Reedyk, head of foreign exchange sales with ANZ bank, said
the local currency had a reasonably quiet session ahead of a
speech by Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 62.09 U.S. cents, up just over half a U.S. cent
from 61.62 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the local close, Hashimoto said his government would
bring in permanent income tax cuts next year, according to Kyodo
News.
</P>
<P>
Much of the upward movement in the Australian dollar was etched
out in overnight offshore dealings, with U.S. institutions adding
some flavor.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended unchanged at 86.15 Japanese yen,
and at 1.1281 German marks from 1.1177 marks Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Abiola's Death Sparks Violence in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The death of Nigeria's opposition
leader Moshood Abiola has sparked violence in Lagos and Ibadan
cities in the southwest, the strongholds of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The violence began Tuesday evening in several parts of Lagos
soon after the news of Abiola's death in Abuja Tuesday afternoon
spread to Lagos, with many of his angry and shocked supporters
taking to the street, attacking cars, shops and burning tyres.
</P>
<P>
A driver told Xinhua he saw hundreds of youths attacking cars
and motorists in the Oshodi area, on his way to the Lagos airport
Tuesday night. He said he saw some people were lying on the
ground, but did not known if they were dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
A foreign businessman who lived in the Ebute-Metta area said
he heard sporadic gunshots outside.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said at least seven people have died.
</P>
<P>
In Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, youths took to the
street, burning vehicles and chanting songs of protest around
Mokola and Gate areas, media reports here said.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Presidency said Abiola died of cardiac
arrest at 4:00 local time Tuesday in Federal capital Abuja, when
he was having a meeting with visiting United States
Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering and Nigerian leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar in the Aso Rock presidential villa on
his release after four years in jail.
</P>
<P>
According to Pickering, who was speaking to the Cable News
Network Tuesday, Abiola seemed to be clear and lucid in his
statement but mid-way through the meeting, in the early stages,
he (Abiola) had to restore his thought, took some tea and had
troubling breathing and then went into toilet.
</P>
<P>
"He came out obviously distressed and asked for cough medicine
and pain killer and sat on the couch and was overheated. He
removed his shirt and asked that the room be ventilated and
generally declined from there," he said.
</P>
<P>
In about seven to 10 minutes, Pickering said, a doctor was
called in and said the man was very ill and had to be admitted to
hospital immediately, upon which Abiola was rushed to the clinic
in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"They (the doctors) worked for over an hour and a half in all
conceivable way... to save his life but unfortunately at the end
of their efforts it was not possible and he died," Pickering
said.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the politician-businessman, was widely believed to be
winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections. His release
has been seen as of crucial importance to the military
government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Last week, visiting United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku said the
military government had agreed to free him very soon, along with
all the other political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who held a private talk with Abiola, said the man
looked hearty and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Some pictures Anyaoku exhibited to newsmen at a press
conference here a week ago showed a smiling Abiola who looked to
be in good health.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government was expected to announce Abiola's
release any time from Wednesday at the end of the one-month
national mourning for late head of state, General Sani Abacha who
died suddenly on June 8.
</P>
<P>
His family in Lagos have been expecting his release in the
last month, since Abacha's death after the release of some
political detainees by new leader Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Though indeed Abiola's death has taken people in surprise and
shock, Pickering said there is no reason to suspect that the
death was caused by anything but natural causes.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that suggests that it was anything
other than what it appeared to the (U.S.) team to be, that is
cardiac arrest," a senior U.S. official said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be a hard task for the Nigerian government to
convince Abiola's supporters that he died a natural death.
Abiola's daughter Wura Abiola has said that she believed her
father was murdered.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Abiola's personal doctor has been
summoned to the clinic at the Aso Rock presidential villa, where
the body lay, to be present at an autopsy if agreed to by the
family.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has extended his condolence
to the Abiola family and urged the military government to make
good on its pledge to release all remaining political detainees
and to define a credible process for the democratic transition to
civilian rule within a reasonable time frame.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council and the National Council
of States are expected to meet Wednesday in Abuja, at the end of
which a transition timetable is expected to be announced, after
one-month long of intensive consultations by the government
involving all sectors of the home society as well as the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abacha's death, Abiola's supporters have been
demanding for the cancellation of Abacha's transition program,
which is expected to usher in an elected civilian government in
October. Instead, they want a national unity government to be
headed by Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Now with Abiola passing away, the only thing that could be
expected from the Abubakar government is the extension of the
transition program from six to one year, as has been canvassed by
some groups.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Expresses Condolences on Abiola's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary
general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), issued a
statement Wednesday, expressing condolences on "the sudden and
most untimely death" of Chief M.K. Abiola of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here by the OAU
information division, Salim said "It is a great and irreplaceable
loss to his family and a serious setback to the Nigerian people"
and "it is particularly tragic that the death of this prominent
Nigerian leader has come at a time when his release to freedom
was imminent."
</P>
<P>
"Chief Abiola commanded the respect and support of millions of
Nigerians, cutting across ethnic, religious and other boundaries,
both for his political leadership and his philanthropic
activities," Salim said, adding that "His concern and activities
were not confined to Nigeria. He used his influence and
resources to support many legitimate African causes."
</P>
<P>
"We in the OAU," Salim said, "will always remember him for his
outstanding and dedicated leadership for the cause of reparations
for which he chaired the group of eminent persons."
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that in the last few years, Chief Abiola has come
to be an important symbol of the pro-democracy movement in
Nigeria. The most fitting tribute therefore that can be given to
him is to ensure that democratic government is restored in
Nigeria as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Given the encouraging and positive steps that have been
recently taken by the present government under the leadership of
the head of state, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, I am confident
that the current leadership of Nigeria is aware of the challenge
that lies ahead and will live up to the aspirations of the
Nigerian people," Salim added.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the Nigerian government to release all the
remaining political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Abiola died of a heart attack Tuesday afternoon at 4 p.m.
local time at the age of 60.

<HEADLINE> HK Puts Reclaimed Site to Tourism-Oriented Uses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government announced Wednesday to
grant a piece of reclaimed land to the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) for temporary uses until 2000.
</P>
<P>
Located on the waterfront of the Victoria Harbor and near the
Central Business District on the Hong Kong Island, the
2.56-hectare former Tamar site was granted under a short-term
tenancy for recreational, entertainment and tourism-oriented and
promotional purposes together with parking of cars for a term up
to June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government received a total of 19 submissions, most of
which proposed the recreational uses. A spokesman for the Lands
Department said Wednesday, "We consider the HKTA, being a statuary
and well-established body, is the most appropriate agent that can
quickly put the site to temporary uses."
</P>
<P>
"The HKTA will be tasked to manage the site and put together a
diversified program for the use of the site throughout the tenancy
period," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA welcomed the government's decision. "This is a unique
site which offers tremendous opportunities to stage events that
could otherwise not be held in Hong Kong," said HKTA Executive
Director Amy Chan.
</P>
<P>
She continued: "The harbor backdrop and central location make
this an ideal venue for major productions that can attract large
audiences both local and from overseas." The HKTA will lease the
site to suitable event organizers.
</P>
<P>
When the tenancy expires in June 2000, the government will
take back the site for the construction of the new Central
government complex.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Decreases in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports registered decreases in
May 1998 on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
According to external trade figures for May released by the
Census and Statistics Department Wednesday, the value of total
exports in May (comprising re-exports and domestic exports)
declined to 113.3 billion HK dollars (14.5 billion U.S. dollars),
3.2 percent lower than that of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the value of re-exports went down by 3.1 percent
to 97 billion HK dollars (12.4 billion U.S. dollars) while that of
domestic exports fell by 3.6 percent to 16.2 billion HK dollars
(2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports dropped by 7.5 percent in May over a year
earlier to 124.5 billion HK dollars (16 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 11.2 billion HK dollars (1.4 billion
U.S. dollars) was recorded in May, according to the statistics.
This figure was much lower than the 17.5 billion HK dollars (2.24
billion U.S. dollars) for May 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months combined in 1998, the value of total
exports was lower by 2.1 percent over the same period last year,
the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman said the export performance
remained slack so far this year partly due to the continued
strength of the U.S. dollar and the reduction in import demand in
Japan as well as in those crisis-hit East Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman noted, exports to a number of other key
markets, including the United States, Britain and Taiwan, should
have registered growth in the first five months taken together.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that the visible trade deficit
narrowed considerably in the first five months as the value of
imports was on a distinct decline amidst the consolidation in
domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Paris Not to Sell Eiffel to U.S., French Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Economy and
Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Wednesday that Paris will
maintain the control of Tower Eiffel instead of selling it to
Americans which will buy a French bank that owns the stocks of
the tourism business from the tower.
</P>
<P>
The French government plans to sell the public insurance bank
Credit Foncier de France (CFF) to the GMAC insurance company of the
United States, which manages the pension fund of the General Motors,
and Texas billionaire Robert Bass.
</P>
<P>
The CFF owns 50 percent of the stocks of tourism business from
Tower Eiffel.
</P>
<P>
The expected take-over of CFF by GMAC and Bass have triggered
fear among some Paris council deputies that the tower will be
also sold to the Americans, who they said could take it to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In response to the worry of the deputies, Strauss-Kahn said in a
communique that this monument is ``imprescriptible and inalienable''
from Paris.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that Paris has the full freedom to choose other
companies to run the tourism business of Tower Eiffel after CFF
changes hands in mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Australia Condemns Japan's Experimental Tuna Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia Wednesday condemned
Japan's experimental tuna fishing program, warning that Japan was
breaching international law if it went ahead with the plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan announced by Japan earlier Wednesday, 65
Japanese vessels will catch up to 1,400 tons of southern bluefin
tuna (SBT) between July 10 and August 31 in the Indian Ocean in a
bid to increase its catch quota.
</P>
<P>
Australian Resources Minister Warwick Parer called in Japanese
Ambassador Yukio Satoh Wednesday morning to condemn Japan's
decision to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's decision to go ahead with the experimental fishing
program is shortsighted, and will reduce the chance that the
southern bluefin tuna stock will recover from its present depleted
state," Parer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are now considering the formal dispute resolution
mechanisms that are available to press the matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese plan came as the Commission for the Conservation
of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has been deadlocked since a
meeting earlier this year where Australia and New Zealand denied
Japan's request to conduct experimental fishing and to increase
the overall catch quota by 3,000 tons from 11,750 tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year's 11,750 ton quota, which had been kept intact for
the past 10 years, allowed Japan to fish 6,065 tons of tuna,
Australia 5,265 tons and New Zealand 420 tons.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already banned Japanese tuna boats from fishing
in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone as well as from Australian
ports except in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
"Following the Japanese decision, Australia will continue the
ban and review it on a month-to-month basis," Parer said.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Japan and New Zealand are the founding members of
the CCSBT, an international organization which sets a total
allowable catch and national allocations for member countries.

<HEADLINE> Abiola's Children Agree on Autopsy, Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Three children of late Nigerian
opposition leader Moshood Abiola have agreed not to bury his body
until full autopsy is carried out, his personal doctor has said.
</P>
<P>
Ore Falomo, personal doctor of Abiola who died Tuesday
afternoon in Nigerian capital Abuja of heart attack, named the
three children as Kola, Deji and Agboola, according to
Wednesday's Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The doctor also said a team of pathologists from Britain and
Canada would arrive in Nigeria within 24 hours to carry out the
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
In a move to convince the opposition of its innocence, the
Nigerian government has ordered an autopsy in the presence of
Abiola's personal doctor, if agreed to by Abiola's family.
</P>
<P>
This means Abiolas' body will not be sent back to Lagos and
buried within 24 hours according to Muslim practices, as it was
indicated earlier.
</P>
<P>
Abiola's sudden death on the eve of his expected release has
aroused suspicions of foul play among his family and the
opposition. His daughter Wura Abiola, who is living in the United
State, said she believed her father was murdered.
</P>
<P>
His death has sparked violence in Lagos and Ibadan cities in
the southwest, the strongholds of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The violence began Tuesday evening in several parts of Lagos
soon after the news of Abiola's death Tuesday afternoon in Abuja
spread to Lagos, with many of his angry and shocked supporters
taking to the street, attacking cars, shops and burning tyres.
</P>
<P>
A driver told Xinhua he saw hundreds of youths attacking cars
and motorists in the Oshodi area, on his way to the Lagos airport
Tuesday night. He said he saw some people were lying on the
ground, but did not know if they were dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
A foreign businessman who lived in the Ebute-Metta area said
he heard sporadic gunshots outside.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said at least seven people have died.
</P>
<P>
In Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, youths took to the
street, burning vehicles and chanting songs of protest around
Mokola and Gate areas, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Presidency said Abiola died of cardiac
arrest at 4:00 p.m. local time Tuesday in the federal capital of
Abuja, when he was having a meeting with visiting United States
Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering and Nigerian leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar in the Aso Rock presidential villa on
his release after four years in jail.
</P>
<P>
According to Pickering, who was speaking to the Cable News
Network Tuesday, Abiola seemed to be clear and lucid in his
statement but mid-way through the meeting, in the early stages,
he (Abiola) had to restore his thought, took some tea and had
trouble in breathing and then went into toilet.
</P>
<P>
"He came out obviously distressed and asked for cough medicine
and pain killer and sat on the couch and was overheated. He
removed his shirt and asked that the room be ventilated and
generally declined from there," he said.
</P>
<P>
In about seven to 10 minutes, Pickering said, a doctor was
called in and said the man was very ill and had to be admitted to
hospital immediately, upon which Abiola was rushed to the clinic
in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"They (the doctors) worked for over an hour and a half in all
conceivable way... to save his life but unfortunately at the end
of their efforts it was not possible and he died," Pickering
said.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the politician-businessman, was widely believed to be
winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections. His release
has been seen as of crucial importance to the military
government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Last week, visiting United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and his Commonwealth counterpart Emeka Anyaoku said the
military government had agreed to free him very soon, along with
all the other political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who held a private talk with Abiola, said the man
looked hearty and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Some pictures Anyaoku exhibited to newsmen at a press
conference here a week ago showed a smiling Abiola who looked to
be in good health.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government was expected to announce Abiola's
release any time from Wednesday at the end of the one-month
national mourning for the late head of state, General Sani Abacha
who died suddenly on June 8.
</P>
<P>
His family in Lagos have been expecting his release in the
last month since Abacha's death following the release of some
political detainees by new leader Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
In a rapid reaction to Abiola's death, the U.N. chief has
extended his condolence to the Abiola family and urged the
military government to make good on its pledge to release all
remaining political detainees and to define a credible process
for the democratic transition to civilian rule within a
reasonable time frame.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council and the National Council
of States are expected to meet Wednesday in Abuja, at the end of
which a transition timetable is expected to be announced, after
one-month long of intensive consultations by the government
involving all sectors of the home society as well as the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abacha's death, Abiola's supporters have been
demanding for the cancellation of Abacha's transition program,
which is expected to usher in an elected civilian government in
October. Instead, they want a national unity government to be
headed by Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Now with Abiola passing away, the only thing that could be
expected from the Abubakar government is the extension of the
transition program from six to one year, as has been canvassed by
some groups.

<HEADLINE> Paris Will Maintain Control of Tower Eiffel: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Economy and
Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Wednesday that Paris will
maintain the control of Tower Eiffel instead of selling it to
Americans which will buy a French bank that owns the stocks of
the tourism business from the tower.
</P>
<P>
The French government plans to sell the public insurance bank
Credit Foncier de France (CFF) to the GMAC insurance company of
the United States, which manages the pension fund of the General
Motors, and Texas billionaire Robert Bass.
</P>
<P>
The CFF owns 50 percent of the stocks of tourism business from
Tower Eiffel.
</P>
<P>
The expected take-over of CFF by GMAC and Bass have triggered
fear among some Paris council deputies that the tower will be
also sold to the Americans, who they said could take it to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In response to the worry of the deputies, Strauss-Kahn said in
a communique that this monument is "imprescriptible and
inalienable" from Paris.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that Paris has the full freedom to choose
other companies to run the tourism business of Tower Eiffel after
CFF changes hands in mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Dates of Register for Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Interior Ministry has
announced August 28 as the date to start register applicants for
the third elections of the Experts Assembly, a powerful body to
determine the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The elections became a hot topic in the country as political
factions hold different views about the procedures of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for membership in the Experts Assembly can enroll
at the governor general's office in each province from August 28
to September 3, the morning daily Iran News Wednesday quoted a
statement from the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The elections for the Experts Assembly will be held on October
23 to choose 86 members from the country's 28 provinces. Each of
them has one to six seats according to their population.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not announced whether the Guardians Council
would screen the qualifications of the applicants as it had done
before in other elections.
</P>
<P>
The moderate factions called for nullification of the
conservative-dominated Guardians Council to screen the
qualifications of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Following the mid-term elections for the Majlis (Parliament)
in March, the moderates accused the conservatives of abusing the
Guardians Council's rights after a number of important moderate
candidates were rejected by the council.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the conservatives for creating hurdles for the
government of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, the
moderates expected to have more influence on other sensitive
bodies to pave the way for Khatami's reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Najmul Hasnain Shah of
Pakistan has won the SAARC Youth Award-1998 for his discovery
regarding the virulence of hemorrhage septicemia which causes
bacteria of cattle and buffalo, the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery describes the production of vacuolating cytotoxic
activity by pasteurella multocida serotype B and E affecting
macrophages, the secretariat said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It explains why these bacteria are not removed from the blood
and tissues of animals suffering from hemorrhage septicemia, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shah, 30, is a veterinarian at the Center of Animal
Biotechnology Veterinary Research Institute based in Peshawar, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The award carries a gold medal, a cash prize of 50,000 U.S.
dollars and a citation in English, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
It will be presented to Dr. Shah at the forthcoming session of
the SAARC Council of Ministers slated for July 27-28 in Colombo,
Sri Lanka, the secretariat added.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Youth Awards Scheme was initiated last year with a
view to encouraging the young talent in the member states to excel
in different fields.
</P>
<P>
The first award, presented to a Bangladeshi national in 1997,
was on the theme of "outstanding service in community welfare"
while the current one is under the theme of "new inventions and
discoveries."
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Thai Trade Fair 1998
opened here Wednesday aiming to boost trade between Thailand and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra
inaugurated the fair, which is also aimed at exploring business
potentials and familiarizing Thai businessmen with their
Bangladeshi counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five Thai companies and 60 Thai businessmen are
participating in the 40-booth fair, the second held in the
Bangladeshi capital by Thailand. The first Thai trade fair was
held here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, a symposium on "Trade and Investment
Opportunities in Bangladesh for Thai Businessmen" will be held.
</P>
<P>
A six-day "Thai Food Week" featuring authentic Thai cuisine is
now being held in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries amounted to 154 million U.S.
dollars last year, much in favor of Thailand, according to a
source of the Thai Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
And it was up to the businessmen of both sides to reduce the
trade gap, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which is undergoing economic difficulties, is looking
for new markets to boost its exports and Bangladesh could be
attractive to the country's businessmen and entrepreneurs, the
Thai Embassy source said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Carry Out Permanent Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said Wednesday his government will carry out permanent
income tax cuts in 1999 in an effort to shore up the sluggish
Japanese economy, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning tax system reform, We would like to implement
(permanent) tax cuts, starting next year, that will be supported
by the public," Hashimoto told a press conference in Nagoya,
central Japan.
</P>
<P>
Permanent income tax cuts are expected to spur consumer
spending, which accounts for about 60 percent of Japan's gross
domestic product (GDP), and to help spark an economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the statement after his vacillation on permanent
income tax cuts over the past several days drew attacks from
within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto apparently decided to make his policy line clear in a
bid to woo voters in Sunday's election for the House of
Councillors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys forecast that the LDP will unlikely realize its
nine-year aspiration of recapturing a majority in the upper
chamber and might even fail to retain the 61 LDP seats being
contested in the race due to the country's slow economy.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Expresses Shock at Abiola's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South African officials
Wednesday expressed shock and sadness at the death of detained
Nigerian politician Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, Nigeria's foremost opposition political figure who
spent the past four years in jail, died of an apparent heart
attack while in a meeting with Nigerian and United States
officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela expressed his "deep shock" at
Abiola's death. Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the
South African government was trying to get more information from
the Nigerian authorities about Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to make a comprehensive statement at this
stage, but there is no doubt that Abiola was a critical factor in
propelling Nigeria to democracy," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, 60, was "taken ill during a meeting which was being
held by Nigerian and United States officials with him," said a
statement from the chief press secretary to Nigerian leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry also expressed shock and regret
at Abiola's death.
</P>
<P>
"We think he could have played an important role in Nigerian
domestic politics," spokesman Machiel van Niekerk said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it was
unfortunate that the Nigerian military government had not seen
fit to release Abiola, a millionaire businessman.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, ANC secretary general Kgalema Motlanthe said:
"Yet we express our hope that Nigerian ruler General Abdulsalam
Abubakar and the Nigerian people will utilize this tragic
incident to forge ahead with speedy preparations for a democratic
election."

<HEADLINE> Fires Kill 54 Ugandans in First Half of 1998 in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-four people have been killed
in more than 140 fire outbreaks in the Ugandan capital Kampala
and its suburbs in the first six months of 1998, a report from
the fire station has said.
</P>
<P>
The undated report carried in Wednesday's New Vision daily
said January and June top the list of fire incidences, with 30
and 28 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mugisa, the chief fire officer, was quoted as
attributing the frequent fire outbreaks to the dry season and
unattended burning candles in residences.
</P>
<P>
Unclear reporting to the fire station is the main cause to the
bulk of destruction, he added.
</P>
<P>
"When a fire breaks out, people try to stop it. When things

<HEADLINE> Burundian Rebels Kill Civilians despite Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 8 (Xinhua) - As the second round of peace
talks for all Burundian warring parties is approaching, there are
still reports of rebels' killing of civilians and refugees
fleeing into neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said Wednesday that at least 19
Burundians were killed last week in two separate rebel attacks
and governmental counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi government and all the political parties as well
as rebel groups promised a ceasefire during their first round of
peace talks last month in Arusha, north Tanzania, and agreed to
resume the talks on July 20.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted an army spokesman as saying Tuesday that
rebels killed five civilians in a village some 100 kilometers
south of the capital Bujumbura, burning 15 houses before the
government forces intervened and killing about ten rebels.
</P>
<P>
Four other civilians were killed when their mini-bus was
ambushed by suspected rebels on a main road south of Bujumbura
along Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR)in Kigoma, west Tanzania, said some 20 to 30
Burundian refugees entered Tanzania daily.
</P>
<P>
"Many of them are uncertain about the truce. They fear of
being killed," a UNHCR official said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a UNHCR report said that as of April 30 this year,
Tanzania accommodates in its western regions a total of 328,737
refugees from neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi,
Rwanda and Somalia, 80 percent of whom are Burundians.
</P>
<P>
Only some 2,000 Burundian refugees have returned home since
Pieere Buyoya took power following a coup in July 1996 which
incurred the economic sanctions by the Great Lakes nations.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 Burundians, mostly civilians, were
reportedly killed since Melchior Ndadaye, first president elected
under a multi-party system, was killed in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 officers and
soldiers from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and armed police
units stationed in eastern, central and southern parts of China
are joining local militiamen to battle heavy flooding and provide
emergency relief.
</P>
<P>
Consecutive days of heavy rain have caused flooding in the
lower and middle of the Yangtze River, the nation's longest
river, and the Pearl River in south China, as well as numerous
other smaller rivers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's edition of People's Daily reported that rapid-response
brigades and emergency units formed by soldiers and local
militiamen in central China's Hubei Province rescued more than
15,000 local residents besieged by flooding, transferred more than
1,000 tons of materials and goods and reinforced dikes stretching
500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Heavy flooding along the Xiangjiang River and its tributaries
in late June ceded, with soldiers and militiamen in neighboring
Hunan Province rushing to repair some 8,700 heavily damaged areas
in preparation for the possibility of new floods.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers in Jiujiang, a popular scenic city in east China's
Jiangxi Province, and local militiamen are patrolling the Yong'an

<P>
Moreover, units of the armed forces have sent medical teams to
flooded areas to provide prompt medical care, distribute medicines
and prevent outbreaks of epidemic diseases.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Ready to End Instability in S. Asia: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is ready for talks to
end the situation of instability and insecurity in South Asia,
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's special envoy Akram Zaki
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Zaki said India's nuclear tests
on May 11 and 13 were a "clear breach" of the international law
and an "act of provocation."
</P>
<P>
After carefully examining the situation, his country conducted
nuclear tests for self-defense on May 28 and 30, he said. "There
was no any alternative for this."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has declared an unilateral moratorium on
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Zaki is in Nepal on a mission to brief the Nepali leaders on
his country's perception of the current situation in South Asia
after the nuke tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He earlier handed over a letter from Sharif to Nepali Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and met with other Nepali leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Nepalese leaders are very much worried about the nuclear
tests, but they agreed that there is a regional balance," Zaki
told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"It will help to understand the gravity of the situation and
resolve the crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the contents of the letter. "The postman
has no right to read the letter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Foreign Ministry has said the letter covered matters
of strengthening regional stability.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said Sharif attaches great importance to
peace and stability and gives top priority to economic cooperation
in South Asia as it is inhabited by most of the poor people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The Kashmir dispute has created difficulties in giving
concentration on economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zaki stressed that the Kashmir issue should be resolved through
discussions and that Pakistan is ready for third-party mediation
to help resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have fought three wars since their
independence in 1947 and two of them were over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out any outside mediation in its dispute with
Pakistan, including that by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On the economic sanctions imposed by the international
community on Pakistan after its nuclear tests, Zaki said, "It may
damage psychologically, but the nation is ready to face it."
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave for Bangladesh Wednesday after
concluding a five-day visit to Nepal. He will also visit Sri Lanka
and the Maldives.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The signing on Monday by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his Kazakh counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev of an agreement on
sharing the oil resources of the northern part of the Caspian Sea
will trigger a dominant politico-economic battle for years to
come. Former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski
even predicts that the Caspian and Central Asia region would
become a new "axis of the world" because of their tremendously
rich oil resources.
</P>
<P>
-- Day after day, the question of Kosovo is becoming more and
more inextricable. The Western powers meeting on Wednesday in Bonn
are faced with increasing difficulty as for what measures to take
to solve the crisis. The European capitals and Washington are
fully aware of the potential devastating consequences of the
Kosovo conflict, as it risks to spread to other countries of the
region, especially Macedonia, where live a great Albanian
community.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The stock exchange markets of Western countries continue to
benefit from the capitals flowing from Asia, where the economic
and financial situation remains unstable. Paris beat its 45th
record in stock index on Tuesday since the beginning of the year,
with its stock index CAC 40 attaining 4,333.09 points.
</P>
<P>
-- The prices of old houses in Paris rose by 1.5 percent in the
first three months of 1998, as compared with the same quarter last
year. This is the first rise of prices of real estate properties
in the capital in seven years. The average price of old real
estates in Paris now stands at 15,277 francs (2,546 U.S. dollars)
one square meter.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of Israel's
industrial companies reported a serious drop in sales to the
domestic market in the second quarter of 1998.

<P>
Local daily Haaretz Wednesday quoted a survey of the

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
According to a forecast of Israeli Finance Ministry, the
economic growth of Israel in 1998 would be only between one to two
percent, the lowest growth rate in decade.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Expels Russian Diplomat in Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean announced Wednesday the
expulsion of a diplomat of the Russian Embassy here in retaliation
for Moscow's deportation of a South Korean diplomat on alleged
espionage activities last weekend.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Sun
Joun-yung called in Valeri Suhinin, a minister-counsellor of the
Russian Embassy in Seoul, and told him that the South Korean
government has decided to evict Oleg Abramkin, a counsellor of
the Russian Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
The decision came just one day after Counsellor Cho Sung-woo of
the South Korean Embassy in Moscow returned here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry last Saturday declared Cho
"persona non grata" and ordered him to leave Russia within 72
hours after detaining and questioning him for hours on espionage
charge last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cho was accused of having engaged in espionage activity by the
Russian Federal Security Service as a Russian Foreign Ministry
official named Valetin Moiseyev was arrested when he was supplying
"confidential information" to Cho.
</P>
<P>
"I am not ashamed of what I did as a diplomat. I think the
Russian government expelled me because it regarded me as
unfriendly, " Cho said upon arrival at Seoul Kimpo International
Airport on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Monday, South Korea protested at the Russian expulsion of Cho,
saying that Russia's detaining of Cho for hours of questioning
last Friday violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
</P>
<P>
The expulsions are the first diplomatic fray in the relations
between the two nations since they set up diplomatic ties in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Legendary Chinese Woman Artist Sets up Foundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A young talented Chinese woman
calligrapher and painter set up a 10-million-yuan (1.2 million
U.S. dollars) foundation here today as part of her effort to
develop China's arts education.
</P>
<P>
Lou Zhenggang, 32, is perhaps the richest young artist in her
circle. As the daughter of an ordinary worker, she established her
name at the age of 12 when she was sent to Beijing's Central
Academy of Fine Arts as an unusually talented child.
</P>
<P>
When she was 22, one of her works sold for 400,000 U.S. dollars
on the Japanese market. Lou now resides in Japan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The successful artist was a guest of Boutros-Boutros Ghali,
former secretary general of the United Nations, and dozens of
Chinese top leaders.
</P>
<P>
There have been debates in China on her success, with many
people describing her as the proof of the theory of innate
genius. However, Lou attributed her success to hard work, and said
that is why she decided to set up the foundation, which aims to
serve young artists who have few opportunities to receive art
training.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes U.N. Resolution to Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League (AL) has
welcomed a resolution adopted by the United Nations General
Assembly on upgrading the Palestinian status in the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation Arab organization expressed hope on Tuesday that
the resolution would be followed by similar steps to bring a just
and comprehensive peace to the Middle East, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly approved an Arab-sponsored resolution
on Tuesday to upgrade the status of the Palestine Liberation
Organization from an observer to that of a near statehood.
</P>
<P>
The voting was 124 in favor, four against with 10
abstentions. Israel, the United States, and the Marshall Islands
and Micronesia, two Pacific island countries, voted against the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is "the most important step" to support the
Palestinian stance on the Israeli intransigence, AL Assistant
Secretary General Mohab Moqbel told MENA.
</P>
<P>
He said the AL will continue contacts and coordination with its
members and the international community to give impetus to the
Palestinian stand.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Kamal, AL assistant secretary general for Palestine's
affairs, said the resolution is an international message to the
Israeli government in the first place that came just in time.
</P>
<P>
The resolution conforms with the international will towards
recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and
the support for the Palestinian struggle for resuming the peace
process under the land-for-peace principle, Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian permanent representative to the AL
Mohamad Sobeih voiced welcome to the U.N. General Assembly
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"It affirms the Palestinians' right to establish an
independent state, with Jerusalem as its capital," Sobeih said.

<HEADLINE> Tinajin to Expand Import-Exports Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin municipality
plans to expand foreign trade in 1998 in order to achieve an
import and export volume of 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Wang Shuzu said the city is both a major
trade center and important foreign trade port in north China.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin exported products valued at 5.02 billion US dollars
in 1997, up 23.9 percent on the previous year, with its import
volume growing by 17.8 percent to 5.01 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city, which has thousands of enterprises engaged in foreign
trade, announced a list of its top 50 foreign trade companies
earlier this year. Of these companies, eight have annual exports
of over 100 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The top 50 enterprises had exports of 3.58 billion US dollars,
or 71.3 percent of the municipality's total export volume.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises, which account for close to one
third of the 50 firms, accounted for over half of the city's total
exports. Motorola ranks first amongst related firms with annual
exports of some 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city expects rapid foreign trade development this year and
has adopted a series of preferential policies to encourage related
activities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Introduce Pollution-free Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have introduced
a new pollution-free pesticide which extensive testing reveals is
safe for the environment, crops, human beings and animals.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology recently organized a
meeting in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu
Province, to promote the new product.
</P>
<P>
The pesticide -- Jingyebao -- was jointly developed in 1996 by
the Yuzhong County Pesticide Plant, Northwest China Agricultural
University and the Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The pollution-free nonchemical fertilizer leaves no poisonous
residue and is thus friendly to the environment, according to
agronomists. They also noted that the product is especially
effective for battling drug-resistant insects and reduces costs by
as much as 30 percent per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists said the environmentally-friendly pesticide, which
is made from nicotine in leaf tobacco, will serve as a replacement
for chemical fertilizers in the next century. They also noted that
Yuzhong County produces more than 40,000 tons of leaf tobacco
annually.
</P>
<P>
Only a small portion of the 2.8 million tons of pesticides used
in China each year reach international standards.
</P>
<P>
Recent tests conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences
revealed that poisonous residue levels for Jingyebao are
substantially lower than permissible levels. "Widespread
applications of the pesticide will contribute greatly to health
care protection," according to Dr. Liu Xinghai from the Ministry
of Agriculture.

ZHENGZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zhongyuan Oilfield, one of the

<HEADLINE> China Develops Large Oilfields in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up exploration of
two large oilfields in the central Bohai Sea in an effort to
achieve an annual crude production capacity of 4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, chief executive officier of the
China Offshore Oil Bohai Corp (COOBC), oil from the two oilfields
-- Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbao 35-2, will be piped inland through
the port of Jingtang in Tangshan City in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield, with 170 million tons of verified
geological oil reserves, is 100 kilometers east of
Tianjin. Eleven wells have already been drilled there.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2 Oilfield lies 20 kilometers south of
Tangshan. Four test-wells have been drilled and geological
reserves of 70 million tons have been identified. Nanbao's
reserves have been estimated at 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the distance between the two oilfields
is only 20 kilometers, making it possible for their joint
development in a 70-sq km oil-bearing area in the Bohai
Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said that seven standard platforms will be erected in the
two oilfields, two pipelines will be laid at the seabed to
transport oil inland, and terminals will be built in the Port of
Jingtang.
</P>
<P>
Also, requisition of 650 meters of coastline will be made for
building oil transport berths. The entire construction project
will cost 7.29 billion yuan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield will
begin production in 2003 and Nanbao one year later. By 2004, the
two oilfields are expected to produce four million tons of oil a
year.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph
Kamotho has urged to narrow the east African country's three
billion Shilling (50.8 million U.S. Dollars) trade imbalance with
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya imports goods worth five billion Shillings (84.7 million
Dollars) from Italy and exports to the European state goods worth
only two billion Shillings (33.9 million Dollars), he was quoted
by Wednesday's media as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Trade between the two countries is low and we would like to
see it increase because if trade and investment grow, we will
rely less on aid," he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Italy to offer more support to small-scale
enterprises in Kenya and use its position in the Group of Seven
and in the European Union to help Kenya expand trade in the
developed world.
</P>
<P>
"Promotion of small-scale enterprises is the only remaining
hope for Kenya," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya receives around 50,000 Italian tourists annually and
many Italians have invested in hotels in Malindi, a famous Indian
Ocean resort located in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement on promotion and
protection of investment last year.

MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada Wednesday reiterated that peace and order will continue to
be a priority under his administration to ensure that the country
will be an investment hub for local and foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada ordered Philippine National Police Director
General Roberto Lastimoso to restore peace and order and break the
backbone of crime syndicates in the country within six months.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered Lastimoso to prosecute a "big fish" in the

<P>
Kidnapping and other crimes are common in the Philippines. Last
year a total of 147 kidnapping cases occurred in the country with
241 people taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the economy can not flourish if crime gangs rule
the streets and sow terror with impunity, scaring away investors.
</P>
<P>
Before assuming the presidency on June 30 this year, Estrada,
as vice president, once chaired the Presidential Anti-Crime
Commission and scored a number of successes in combating kidnapper
and bank robber gangs.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Child Feeding Program Urges for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Child Supplementary
Feeding Program (CSFP) urgently requires 5.5 million U.S. Dollars
to restock its depleted reserves and save from collapse the
government scheme under which 400,000 children receive food
monthly.
</P>
<P>
Failure to raise the funds immediately will jeopardise efforts
by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare to control cases of
severe malnutrition in children, particularly in the drought-hit
areas, The Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Maize-meal and cooking oil, the main food components of the
program, have already run out, the CSFP said.
</P>
<P>
The CSFP has already presented the matter to the national
drought relief committee in the Ministry of Public Service, Labor
and Social Welfare to source the required funds from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The CSFP headquarters in Harare Tuesday confirmed the food
shortage and said it was worried that donors would only consider
assistance if the shortage was declared a national disaster.
</P>
<P>
The number of beneficiaries fluctuated over the years with
about one million children under the program at one point. This
had dropped to 300,000 during good seasons.

<HEADLINE> S. African Post Office Workers Strike for Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South African post office
workers are starting a nationwide strike Wednesday after a
dispute over wages, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The three-day industrial action of 40,000 employees threatens
to ground essential telephone and postal services throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The South African Post Office raised its concern Tuesday about
the strike, saying it would worsen the company's financial
situation and have a negative effect on customer service.
</P>
<P>
"The Post Office's delivery standards have improved
considerably and more than 90 percent national mail is being
delivered on time. A one-day strike could cause a drop of 2.5
percent in that month's delivery standards," the company said.
</P>
<P>
While the Post Office requested all employees to seriously
consider the consequences of participating in strike action,
unions threatened that should the Post Office and Telkom, a
cellular phone service, fail to meet their demands during the
three-day protest, they would embark on a nationwide full-blown
strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of registered
vehicles in the United States has surpassed 200 million for the
first time, according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Polk Co., which produced the study from state registration
records, said there have been more than 201 million cars and
trucks registered in the country by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years after the country's human population surpassed
200 million, the number of vehicles in operation has done the
same," said Glenn Forbes, vice president of Polk.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed the popularity of light trucks -- sport
utility vehicles, pickups, vans and mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the number of cars on the road has
risen 4.82 million, compared with a rise of 29.05 million for
trucks, said the annual Polk study.
</P>
<P>
However, in November 1997, the number of new light trucks
registered actually exceeded the number of new cars for the first
time, it added.

<HEADLINE> China to Connect Large Power Grids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Almost all of the power grids in
China will be interconnected before 2020 to allow power exchanges
nationwide, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing economy has brought a new stage in power
development characterized by large capacity and large grids, said
Huo Ji'an, deputy general manager of the State Power Grid
Development Co. Ltd. China now has six inter-provincial power grids
and a group of provincial ones, with 567,000 kilometers of
transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Power Station will create favorable
conditions for the interconnection of power grids nationwide. It
will provide power for the grids in Central, North China and in
Sichuan province and help form the Great Central China Power
Grid, spanning a distance of 2,000 kilometers from east to
west. The grid will also serve as a link to the North, Northwest,
and South grids, Huo said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, a framework of various inter-provincial grids will
take shape, involving completion of two grids of 500 and 330
kilovolts.
</P>
<P>
Huo said that the Three Gorges Power Station will be completed
by 2009, and a 500-kilovolt project ranging from there to the
Central, North and Sichuan power grids will be established with
9,100 kilometers of direct and alternating current transmission
lines.
</P>
<P>
Thermal-power production bases in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Jiangxi
provinces will ensure large power supplies for Beijing, Tianjin,
Tangshan, Baoding cities in north China and some cities in
northeast China, Huo said.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe, Chiluba on Renewed Angolan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
and his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba expressed concern
about the resurgence of conflict in Angola saying there was need
for a speedy solution to be found to guard against renewed
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Tuesday night there was need for Chiluba, who
engineered the Lusaka protocol, signed between the ruling
Movement for People's Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party and
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) movement to revisit the issue to try and establish the
problem resulting in the renewal of the conflict, the Daily
Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka protocol brought normalcy to the war-torn country that
had been rocked by a civil war for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
"It would be good if President Chiluba once again revisited
the protocol and get in touch with Savimbi and President Eduardo
dos Santos and try to read from him (Savimbi) what he says and
what his feelings are and what the problem is," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see any resort to fighting, to guns, the
people of Angola have had enough of dying and suffering," he
said, "they must go ahead with reconstruction and we want peace
and stability."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said, "all of us were surprised that there were still
conflicts, a solution to the problem in Angola has to be found...
this (the conflict) is simply because of bad behavior on the part
of Savimbi."
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president, who arrived in Zimbabwe aboard a
British Airways Boeing 747 400 plane and held private talks with
Mugabe at Harare airport, was on transit to London.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba added the two leaders also discussed the Eritrean and
Ethiopian border issue and the Organisation of African Unity's
efforts to bring peace between the warring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that guns are silent for the moment because of
the trip in which President Robert Mugabe was recently involved,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Restaurants Open Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China has a total of 120,000
Muslim restaurants nationwide and Muslim food has emerged as the
most popular ethnic food for the nation's 55 minority
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yunfu, deputy director of the Islamic Association of China,
told participants at the recent First National Symposium on Muslim
Food Culture that most Muslim restaurants in China's 30 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions are under private ownership.
</P>
<P>
He said the popularity of Muslim restaurants indicates that the
custom and traditions of China's minority groups are fully
respected. He noted that the Muslim catering trade has witnessed
rapid development, especially in northern and northwestern China
which are home to Muslims living in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
Muslim enterprises account for 80 percent of the total number
of restaurants in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, or "China's Muslim Province".
</P>
<P>
The number of Muslim restaurants in neighboring Shaanxi
Province has skyrocketed from 640 in 1990 to some 5,000
today, or 27 percent of the total number of enterprises in the
province's catering sector.
</P>
<P>
China's Muslim catering trade has a history of over 1,300 years
and the nation now has a Muslim population of around 20 million
people.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions, as well
as a number of provinces, have adopted local regulations to
protect the Muslim food industry and catering sector.
</P>
<P>
The China Cuisine Association established a Muslim division in
1996 to list and reintroduce traditional Muslim dishes and snack
foods. The association has since compiled a publication listing
nearly 2,000 Muslim dishes.

HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The seventh session of the
Zimbabwe/Botswana Joint Commission for Economic Cooperation ended
in Harare Tuesday with the two countries signing a cultural
agreement to extend areas of mutual interest, the Daily Herald
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Issues covered in the cultural agreement include trade,
finance, agriculture, transport, tourism, mining, education and
culture to which the commission urged speedy implementation of
all the agreements and bilateral programs the two countries have

</P>
<P>
To strengthen cooperation between the two countries further,
three draft proposals were submitted. These are memorandum of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Ruling Golkar Reforms for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to keep its long-time
political dominance by winning the general elections scheduled for
next May, Indonesia's ruling Golkar (Functional Group) will
convene an extraordinary congress here this week to carry out
important restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The congress to be held from Thursday to Saturday has been
described by the local press as an important event in Golkar's
history and is expected to set out a new format for the party's
organizational structure.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here Tuesday, chairman of the
extraordinary congress organizing committee Waskito Reksosoedirdjo
revealed that significant changes would be made in Golkar's
policy-making and advisory councils.
</P>
<P>
"We will include the abolition of Golkar's board of patrons,
board of advisors and board of councilors on the agenda of the
extraordinary congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is part of our commitment to total reformation," he said,
adding that the three bodies have such enormous power including
the authority to freeze Golkar's executive board.
</P>
<P>
Based on current Golkar rules and regulations, the board of
patrons headed by former President Soeharto has extensive
authority and the right to annul policies adopted by the head of
the Golkar executive board. Soeharto resigned on May 21 amid
strong public pressure calling for political reforms.
</P>
<P>
The veto right of the board of patrons means that even though
he has stepped down from the presidency, Soeharto still wields
considerable power over the organization.
</P>
<P>
Waskito said there were several options for replacing the board
of patrons, including the establishment of a new board with a
limited advisory role or the removal of the board of patrons' veto
rights.
</P>
<P>
Golkar members and analysts here believe that the upcoming
congress marks a turning point in the evolution of the
organization, particularly in its efforts to become more
independent from the Armed Forces (ABRI). For most of the
country's nearly 53 years of independence, the military has played
an important role in political life.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a congress of the Muhammadiyah Youth organization
last Friday, Minister of Defense and Security and ABRI Commander
General Wiranto said ABRI would be ready to forsake its
influential role in Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Election of Golkar's new chairman is another important item on
the agenda of the upcoming congress which was advanced from a
proposed October date. Several candidates have been proposed by
various sections to replace the current chairman, Harmoko.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian Retired Military Officers Union
Association and former Vice President Try Sutrisno told reporters
Tuesday that former Defense Minister Edi Sudradjat meets the
criteria for election as the new chairman.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Sudradjat, who has obtained support from
retired generals and other Golkar cadres, appears as the strongest
candidate in the field, followed by Minister/Secretary of State
Akbar Tanjung, Yogyakarta Sultan Sri Hamengku Buwono X and
Manpower Minister Fahmi Idris.
</P>
<P>
Golkar was established in 1964 as an amalgamation of seven
organizations which include the armed forces, labor organizations
and cooperative movements. It has been a dominant political
organization in nearly three decades. The organization, which won
all the seven general elections in the past, grabbed 325 of the
425 seats up for election in the House of Representatives in the
May general elections last year.
</P>
<P>
But local press reports said Golkar will face a big challenge
in next year's general elections which will be contested by more
political parties.
</P>
<P>
"If Golkar can remain united and re-direct its energies away
from the personal enrichment that has so soured its image, it
retains a chance of grabbing a majority of votes at any poll," the
Indonesian Observer commented.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's highest legal body, the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), will convene an extraordinary meeting on November
10 this year to set the date for next May's general elections.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exports Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian exports fell sharply in
the first two months of the current financial year beginning April
1, while imports went up by 9.71 percent, resulting in a trade
deficit of around 1.85 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released Tuesday, exports in
April and May are estimated at 4.994 billion U.S. dollars as
against 5.401 billion dollars in the previous corresponding
period, representing a fall of 7.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is noticeable that exports for May, when India conducted
nuclear tests, dropped to 2.369 billion U.S. dollars compared with
2.862 billion dollars a year earlier, down by 17.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a sharp depreciation of the Indian currency,
exports in rupee terms registered a 3.4 percent increase during
the two months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports in April-May amounted to 6.850 billion
dollars as against 6.243 billion dollars a year earlier, an
increase of 9.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Faced with this situation, Commerce Minister Rama Krishna Hegde
held an emergency meeting with Finance Minister Yashwant Singh
Tuesday to work out a package of measures to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
The sectors which are expected to be targeted for increasing
exports are the worst-hit areas like electronics hardware, cotton
yarn and food processing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Antarctica experienced a warm winter
with showers, instead of the usual snowfalls, in its coldest
month of June this year, a Polish scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Professor S.R-Suszczewski, a researcher in the biological
institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences, said this winter in
Antarctica was the warmest since 1977, the Polish Press Agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Polish observation station in Antarctica measured a record
high of 9 degrees above zero centigrade in June, the scientist
said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout June and in early July, the temperature stayed above
zero, bringing down warm rains and thus creating water ponds on
melting glaciers.
</P>
<P>
Only on July 4, a mild winter appeared with strong wind and
snowfall, and temperature fell to 6.5 degrees centigrade below
zero.
</P>
<P>
Researchers attributed the warm winter to the worsening El Nino
weather phenomenon, which brought abnormal conditions to a vast
area ranging from Antarctica to Alaska in North America.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's State Records Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Sarawak, Malaysia's largest
state, recorded a trade surplus of 5.99 billion ringgit (1.46
billion U.S. dollars) in the first five months of this year,
according to the state's Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 44 percent rise over 4.155 billion
ringgit (one billion U.S. dollars) during the corresponding period
last year, showed the preliminary figures released Wednesday by
the department.
</P>
<P>
During January-May, the total exports stood at 9.651 billion
ringgit (2.353 billion dollars), a 41 percent increase, while
imports were worth 3.662 billion ringgit (893 million dollars), a
fall of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) remained its largest export item in
value, netting 3.815 billion ringgit (930 million dollars) or 40
percent of the total exports during January-May.
</P>
<P>
The department said the 41 percent higher export receipts were
solely realized through the higher currency exchange rate during
the period.
</P>
<P>
Crude petroleum was the second largest revenue earner, netting
1.662 billion ringgit (405 million dollars) or 17 percent of
Sarawak's total exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, 87 percent of Sarawak's exports
during the period were channeled directly to foreign countries and
the rest to Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah in the form of
inter-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and transport equipment accounted for 39 percent of
the state's total imports, it said.

MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan and Belarus said Tuesday
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is an acceptable
format for cooperation among former Soviet republics in a
transition period.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique released before Belarussian Foreign

disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Antonovich, Belarussian President Emomali
Rakhmonov said reform is a must for the CIS, and every member
state of the grouping should live up to its commitments under
multinational treaties.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Banning Inland Shrimp Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has endorsed a
resolution of the National Environment Board (NEB) banning inland
shrimp farming in fresh water areas nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The ban will take effect 120 days after Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai publicly ordered the enforcement of the ban in the Royal
Gazette, according to a government press release received
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While environmentalists have applauded the development,
anti-government critics have been giving new ammunition saying the
ban would send the shrimp farm industry reeling at a time when the
government is supposed to protect viable businesses.
</P>
<P>
The NEB resolution was based on Article 9 of the 1992
Environmental Protection Act which gives the prime minister
absolute authority to ban any activity which might cause
environmental hazards.
</P>
<P>
To shrimp farmers and companies selling shrimp feed, inland
shrimp farming is a bonanza of high profits. But as they moved
farming locations further inland, salt water has been transported
to fill their ponds, thus threatening paddy fields and eroding
soil.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have relentlessly crusaded against inland
shrimp farming.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to trigger a major outcry from farm
operators. But Science Minister Yingphan Manasikarn said that
although he sympathized with the shrimp farmers, he could not
allow the farming to continue because of its hazards to the
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
"I know it brings very high income to the country but if we
allow the farming to remain in our fresh water area, foreign
governments may boycott our other exports and we will suffer
more," he said.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A Buddhist monk has handed over to
the Thai government 1.2 million U.S. dollars and other donations
from worshippers to help rescue the ailing economy, government
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Phra Maha Bua Yanasampanno of Wat Pa Bantad in Udon Thani on
the outskirts of Bangkok has collected 182.5 kilograms of gold
ornaments, 12 million baht (300,000 dollars) and 1.2 million
dollars in cash since he began asking his followers for donations
to the government on April 12.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, thousands of people thronged his temple to hand
in their valuables and cash.
</P>
<P>
This was the first lot of U.S. dollars handed over to the
government, said Col. Therdsak Chaiyasith, a member of the "Help
the Country Project."
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cash will be handed over later, Therdsak said,
adding that he wanted to raise at least one ton of gold.
</P>
<P>
"The gold will be handed over to the central bank when the
amount is big enough," Therdsak said.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor Chatumongol Sonakul said the "Help the
Country Project" will inspire the Thais to join forces in pulling
the country out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Every one should pray that the generous rich will donate their
assets to salvage the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has collapsed into a recession since the devaluation
of the baht on July 2 last year. Governmental and non-governmental
organizations have launched various campaigns to help resolve the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Belarus President Hopes to Maintain Military Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexandr
Lukashenko said on Tuesday his country should keep its military
strength amid NATO's continued eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
As quoted by an Interfax news agency report from Minsk,
Lukashenko said to a group of graduates from the National Military
Academy that he advocated prudence in downsizing the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its expansion despite the opposition from other
countries, he said, NATO was exerting pressures on those unwilling
to follow the Western bloc's political and economic lines.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstance, both Russia and Belarus should keep
military strength strong enough for defending their territories,
and work together in restructuring their military forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bound by a Russia-Belarus Union from 1996, the two countries,
however, have decided to keep their armed forces independent.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, which joined the NATO's Partnership for Peace program
of military cooperation in January 1995, has planned to cut its
currently 80,000-strong military personnel down to 65,000.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Exploration of Coal-Bed Methane Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China is hoping to establish an
improved industrial system for coal-bed methane by the year 2010,
one capable of producing 10 billion cubic meters of coal-bed
methane annually.
</P>
<P>
China now has 35,000 billion cu m of coal-bed methane
resources, 62 percent of which lie buried in the country's
northern regions. This untapped coal-bed methane has a volume
equivalent to that of China's conventional natural gas resources,
placing China third in the world in this resource.
</P>
<P>
During the ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000), two or
three coal-bed methane production bases will be constructed to
step up exploration of the country's plentiful coal-bed methane.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2000 the gap between supply
and demand for petroleum will be 40 million tons and that of
natural gas will be between two billion to five billion cu m. And
the supply-to-demand gap for petroleum will grow from 70 million
to 80 million tons, and 20 billion cu m to 40 billion cu m for
natural gas by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the State Council, China United Coal-Bed Methane
Co. Ltd. (CUCBM) was set up in 1996 to handle all activities
related to exploration of coal-bed methane resources in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Central Government has drafted and published a wide
range of preferential policies to speed up growth of the coal-bed
methane industry.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in attracting foreign funds and
technologies for the exploration of coal-bed methane resources as
exploration demands high investment and involves great risks.
</P>
<P>
Provinces like Anhui, Liaoning and Shanxi have been given
approval to cooperate with foreign transnationals of the United
States and Australia in developing coal-bed methane resources.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, CUCBM signed a contract with Texaco of the
United States to jointly explore coal-bed methane resources under
2,600 sq km of land in east China's Anhui Province. This land is
thought to contain 60 billion cu m of coal-bed methane, and the
cooperation project will require an investment of 500 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM also signed two separate contracts with the Atlantic
Richfield Company and the Phillips Petroleum Company of the United
States to develop coal-bed methane in 8,700 sq km of Hedong
Coal-Bed Methane Field in north China's Shanxi Province. This
cooperative prospecting project will involve an investment of 30
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hedong Coal-Bed Methane Field has an area of 16,000 sq km and
is estimated to contain 3,000 billion cu m of coal-bed methane
resources. By the year 2010 it will be able to produce five
billion cu m of coal-bed methane annually.

</P>
<P>
The Australian:

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The senate was poised to approve the government's Wik

percent of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The pressure being applied to BHP Crop. has been intensified

<HEADLINE> Primakov Stresses Russian-U.S. Cooperation on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Tuesday called for continuous Russian-U.S. joint
efforts to seek a political solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told the Itar-Tass news agency that Joint moves by
Russia and the United States were of special importance prior to
the six-nation Contact Group's discussions on the Kosovo crisis in
Bonn, which is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Together with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky visited Kosovo on Sunday and
held talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo ethnic Albanian
leader. It was the first joint action taken by the two envoys over
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Afanasyevsky also exchanged views with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on seeking a political way
out of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Primakov hailed the Afanasyevsky's mission as a key effort to
help solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that
Afanasyevsky had called on the Serbian authorities and the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo to resume negotiations which, he noted, was
the first step toward ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted Afanasyevsky as saying that the Serbian
side "has been ready for negotiations" but the ethnic Albanian
leaders "have neither responded to the call, nor guaranteed a
ceasefire."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province where 90 percent of the population
are ethnic Albanians, has sunk into chaos since February when the
illegal Kosovo Liberation Army clashed with Serb police. Several
hundred people have been killed in continuing conflicts.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Afanasyevsky would attend the Contact
Group meeting in Bonn and brief group members on his recent trip
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, Britain,
Germany, France and Italy -- has an international mandate to
monitor events in the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Elects Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, Tuesday ended a nearly two-month deadlock in finding a
new head by electing Alexandr Tkachenko as its speaker.
</P>
<P>
Tkachenko, 59, of the Peasants Party, finally won a 232-37 vote
after the unicameral legislative body had held over 20 rounds of
failed voting since May 12. Forty-five votes were declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ukrainian Constitution, at least 226 votes, or half
those of the 450-seat legislature, were required to be elected.
</P>
<P>
After his election, Tkachenko, the previous Supreme Soviet's
first vice-chairman since May 1994, said his priorities were to
form a leading group and improve the parliament's legislative work.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the parliament and the government should have
better relations, he said the two sides should work together to
take long-waited measures to defuse the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tkachenko was the former Soviet republic's agriculture and food
minister before 1991. He briefly served as Ukraine's agriculture
minister in 1992, and co-founded the Land and People agrarian
association.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Attract More Tourists From Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to organize more
travel shows in other neighboring countries, especially Thailand,
to attract tourists from there following its tourism promotion
campaign launched in Singapore recently.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's first two-day travel show in Singapore has brought
about initiation of tour arrangements for more Singaporeans and
tourists to visit the country, the official New Light of Myanmar
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among Myanmar's neighboring countries, Thailand plays a key
role in supplying tourists to the countries, ranking second after
Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year that ended in March, more than 7,000
tourists from Thailand visited Myanmar out of more than 246,000
from 24 countries and regions, according to the official monthly
Economic Indicators.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the entry point of Yangon International Airport,
Myanmar has also drawn visitors through border points, receiving a
large number of visitors through Kawthaung at the southern end of
Myanmar bordering Thailand, where some islands are opened to
foreign investors for building resorts.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's investment in Myanmar's hotels and tourism sector,
second only to Singapore, amounted to 200 million U.S. dollars in
eight projects at the end of March this year, compared to a total
foreign investment of more than 1 billion dollars in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Despite its "Visit Myanmar Year" campaign launched in 1996,
Myanmar has received a smaller number of tourists in the past two
years. The country is taking measures to attract tourists in the
forthcoming open tourist season beginning October.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Customs Boss Sentenced for Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A former Argentine customs
leader was sentenced to 10 years in jail on a charge of
"aggravated smuggling," Argentine judicial sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Guillermo Tiscornia said Juan Carlos Delconte, former
head of the Argentine National Customs Administration in
1984-1989, had caused "a multimillion damage" to the country.
</P>
<P>
The judge said Delconte created a "parallel register" in the
Ezeiza international airport to smuggle goods in the name of
non-existent individuals, or historical figures.
</P>
<P>
The former official undertook the smuggling along with two
accomplices who operated in the airport and were in charge of
securing the clandestine trading, Tiscornia said.
</P>
<P>
Delconte began smuggling in 1991 and subsequently served four
years in prison, but was set free in September 1994 on bail of
150,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sea Fish Species Affected By Sri Lankan Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Some sea fish species have been
adversely affected by a recent oil spill off Sri Lanka's Colombo
harbor, the official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report by the National Aquatic Resources Research and
Development Agency on the environmental impact of the spill said
there was still light crude oil spread over the surface of the
shore area.
</P>
<P>
Last week, more than 70 tons of crude oil were leaked into the
sea during unloading from an Iranian tanker five miles off the
Colombo port, causing a thick oil slick along the coast extending
about seven miles.
</P>
<P>
The oil made it difficult for some species of fish to move
especially near coral reefs and rocks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said if the oil gets deposited in the sea bed the
situation would be even worse. The impact of the oil spill on sea
birds is also being studied, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There had been no report of fish deaths in large numbers yet,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that damage to the environment caused by
the oil spill was estimated at 100,000 U.S. dollars.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian soccer fans
went absolutely wild on Tuesday after their team won a tense and
hard-fought World Cup semi-final against the Netherlands, 4-2 on
penalties.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the defending World Cup champions burst into
spontaneous street parties and horn-honking traffic jams while
firecrackers boomed across the country after goalkeeper Taffarel
saved a second penalty to put Brazil into World Cup final on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fans ran, hands outstretched, down the beachfront streets of
Brazil's famous carnival city of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Moments before, all eyes glued to televisions and screens set
up in bars, offices and on street corners around the city, as they
watched in breathless silence.
</P>
<P>
In Sao Paulo, the biggest city of the country, Brazilians
shouting "Five-time champions" and waving banners hung out of cars
careening down the wide Paulista Avenue, while another part of the
street was blocked off and filled with hundreds of thousands of
celebrating inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Most radio and television commentators predicted that if Brazil
played at the same level, they would probably defeat the winner of
the France-Croatia semi-final to take fifth World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
Emotion even overtook the usually sedate capital city of
Brasilia, where there were at least two major automobile pileups
as residents raced madly home.
</P>
<P>
A soccer fan, a longtime foreign resident here, said after
Brazil winning over the Netherlands that "That's the real Brazil
playing."

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government is keen
to expand its trade ties with European Union (EU) countries,
Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzowski said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, Guzowski said, Costa Rica hoped that the
EU's preferential system for Central American agricultural
products could be extended to the region's industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Europe, next only to the United States, is the second largest
overseas market for Costa Rica, which exports mainly its coffee,
banana, fruits and ornamental plants there.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's banana takes a 25 percent share in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, its exports to Europe totaled 847 million U.S.
dollars, up 0.7 percent from the previous year and nearly double
over the 1990 figure of 430 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guzowski said, the government would like to
attract more European capital into the country, especially in
areas involving latest technologies.

<HEADLINE> Lobbying Cost Reached 1.17 Billion Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Special interests in the United
States reported spending 1.17 billion dollars last year to lobby
Congress, the White House and the federal bureaucracy, according
to the first computerized study of year-end disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
In all, companies, labor unions, interest groups and
municipalities reported hiring 14,484 lobbyists, a contingent that
outnumbers members of Congress 27-to-1, according to an Associated
Press computer analysis of lobbying disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
The database, a joint project with the nonprofit, nonpartisan
Center for Responsive Politics, provides the most comprehensive
look at lobbying spending since federal disclosures began two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The most heavily lobbied issues in 1997 were the federal
budget, taxes, health, transportation and defense, the analysis
showed.
</P>
<P>
About 42 percent of the lobbyists listed the budget as one of
their interest areas.
</P>
<P>
The king of the lobbying crowd in 1997 was the American Medical
Association, which reported spending 17.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The nation's doctor lobby is pressing to give patients and
doctors more freedom under managed care health plans, and for
legislation to reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
Also lobbying on anti-smoking legislation was tobacco, beer and
food giant Philip Morris, the second-biggest spender at 15.8
million dollars. Part of that was spent trying to persuade
Congress to ratify a 368 billion-dollar deal between the tobacco
industry and a group of state attorneys generals. After the deal
was altered to add a 1.10 dollar-per-pack tax that the tobacco
companies opposed, the Senate shelved it last month.
</P>
<P>
Overall, major tobacco industry players reported spending 31.65
million dollars lobbying last year.
</P>
<P>
But that was only about half as much as the telecommunications
industry, which spent 63.96 million dollars. In that industry,
several giants are seeking approval for mergers, and local
telephone companies and long distance companies are pressing to
break into each other's markets.
</P>
<P>
Other major categories included the pharmaceutical industry,
oil and gas, defense, the automobile industry and business
groups.

<HEADLINE> China's Laid-off Workers Find Jobs in Consumer Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
workers laid off from manufacturing industries now find jobs in
consumer industries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liping, who lost job at a textile mill in Taiyuan,
capital of Shanxi Province, finds herself a place at free market
selling clothing every day and earns 4 to 5 times more than the
salary she used to earn from the mill. This is nothing
extraordinary in Taiyuan, where 24,000 unemployed workers have
relocate positions in free markets.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has spent 170 million yuan (20.5
million US dollars) investing in 181 free markets, opening up
channels to absorb more laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Some debt-ridden state-owned enterprises are also setting up
markets in their idle workshops or warehouses to provide jobs for
redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan Leather Shoe Factory, for instance, turned some of
its workshops into a large market where some 360 workers have jobs
again. The market earned a profit of 1.7 million yuan and paid the
local government 1.8 million yuan in tax last year.

<P>
KIEV, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The new Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine,
Zhou Xiaopei, presented his credentials to Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, the third Chinese ambassador to Ukraine, told Kuchma that
China will continue to support Ukraine's efforts in maintaining
its independence, sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Ukraine have built up a sound relationship of
mutual trust, mutual benefit and mutual support since the two
countries established diplomatic ties in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said it is important for Ukraine to develop a special
partnership with China. He said he is happy about the development
of bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
While thanking China for supporting Ukraine's efforts in
maintaining independence and territorial integrity, Kuchma said
Ukraine backs China's stand on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Ukrainian government will stick to the
"one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhou briefed Kuchma over the recent visit U.S. President Bill
Clinton made to China and the Ukrainian president welcomed the
improvement of the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that as two big countries and permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council, China and the United States
should be friendly, not hostile, to each other.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Kuchma said that Ukraine would join
hands with China to further relations between them.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Car production
totalled 876,958 units in the first six months of 1998, a 14
percent reduction from the same period last year when about 1.03
million cars were produced.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Auto Manufacturers said the sales
of cars on the domestic market dropped by 23.36 percent to 647,000
units in this period, compared with the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jose Carlos Pinheiro Neto, chairman of the association, said
the goal of two million cars was hard to fulfill this year, and
only 1.75 million cars were expected to be produced, a 15 percent
drop over last year.
</P>
<P>
Although production was down, the export of cars increased 10
percent, to 210,000 units, in the first six months of 1998, the

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Invest More in Tianjin's Agriculture, Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in north
China's biggest port city, Tianjin, remains stable although more
rises are registered in agriculture and infrastructure and
downfalls in real restate, according to the Deputy Mayor Wang
Shuzu.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that during the first five months, contracted foreign
investment in agriculture rose by 150 percent over the same 1997
period while that in real estate dropped by 67 percent. Investment
in infrastructure, especially in road communications facilities,
rose considerably to take up 35 percent of the total investment
and reach the level of the conventioanl manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
There is also an increasing number of larger projects, the
deputy mayor said. Forty-six projects, each involving 5 million
U.S. dollars or above, were approved in the first five months, up
50 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Asian financial crisis, investment from Japan, the
Republic of Korea and Southeast Asian countries dropped sharply,
but investment from the United States and Europe shot up, he said,
adding that in the first five months, the U.S. investment alone
more than doubled that of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Shuzu, from January through May, 378
foreign-funded enterprise were approved, a slight rise over the
same period last year. The amount of foreign investment totalled
804 million U.S. dollars, about the same level of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local statistics, foreign-funded enterprises which
have been operating in this city added 320 million U.S. dollars of
investment from January through May, which indicates the
successful operation of these enterprises and their confidence in
investing in China, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the municipal government plans to adopt a series
of new measures to further improve the environment for foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Report Says SFOR Needs to Remain in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) needs to remain in Bosnia for some time
to maintain a fragile peace, said a U.S. congressional report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of a self-sustaining peace process in Bosnia remains
elusive, primarily due to the continued intransigence of Bosnia's
political leaders," said the General Accounting Office of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The report said there's much still to be done to implement the
1995 Dayton peace accord, which ended a four-year civil war
between the Serbs, Muslims and Croats in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The report cites return of war refugees as a continuing problem
and says political and civil reforms are going slow, mostly
because of reluctant local Bosnian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"A substantial NATO-led force is still needed to provide
security for the civil aspects of the operation," the report said,
adding that "it will likely be some time" before the Dayton goals
are met.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, President Bill Clinton announced that
the U.S. military would continue to participate in the
peacekeeping force beyond June 1998, setting no new deadline for
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 U.S. troops remain in Bosnia as part of the
34,000-member SFOR, which NATO has agreed to maintain for at least
another year.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Shell Dike Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Huanghua City of Northern Hebei
Province is pulling out all the stops to save the only large-scale
ancient shell dike on the Pacific-Ocean's western shores,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It said that only one kilometer of the 31-kilometer
Huanghua-Haixing Ancient Shell Dike has survived people's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The dike consists of six separate parts parallel to the area's
modern coastline. It was gradually formed in the past 7,000 years
as tides and winds pushed shells onto land.
</P>
<P>
The dike is one of the world's three longest and oldest shell
dikes -- the other two are located in North America and South
America's Surinam. The Huanghua dike records important information
on environmental changes on the Bohai Sea's west shore.
</P>
<P>
The information is very important for calculating future
geological changes and setting a long-term development strategy
for the area, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chaoying, a Tianjin deputy to the National People's
Congress, submitted a proposal in 1995 pleading for immediate
protection of the dike.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, 1995, local government officially banned mining
of the dike.
</P>
<P>
Du Likai, director of the Huanghua County-Level Ancient Shell
Dike Protection Zone, and his two colleagues now go there twice a
day to make sure no one has dug the dike, chopped down trees or
dumped rubbish there.
</P>
<P>
Although "scars" are still obvious on the dike, grass and trees
are gradually covering them. Fences now keep cars and people from
the dike, and dike guardians have their own watch station so they
do not freeze at night.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is now well in the process of establishing a provincial
protection zone for the dike.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mount Merapi Shows Signs of Eruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Residents around Indonesia's most
active volcano have been on alert after deadly Mount Merapi showed
signs of a possible eruption, the Indonesian Observer reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Merapi's status had been raised from "normal" to "alert," said
Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of the directorate of Volcanology in
Yogyakarta in Central Java Province.
</P>
<P>
He said the alarm was raised after a rise in volcanic activity
had caused a large amount of magma moving closer to the top of the
2,968-meter-high mountain.
</P>
<P>
"The endless supply (of magma) will cause an accumulation of
volcanic material on the surface which can turn into hot gas and
ash," he said.
</P>
<P>
The volcano is about 20 kilometers from Yogyakarta and forms a
backdrop of the historical city of two million people.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994, Mount Merapi, 400 kilometers east of Jakarta,
erupted without warning and killed 60 people. In January 1997,
more than 8,000 nearby villagers had to be evacuated after the
volcano spewed hot gas, ash and lava.

<HEADLINE> Stopping Marine Environmental Degradation In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Deterioration of the marine
environment near the port city of Tianjin, about 100 km east of
Beijing, has been checked, according to Cui Yucheng, deputy
director of the Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The discharge of pollutants has been reduced, with inorganic
nitrogen discharges down to 89.4 percent from 99.5 percent in
1995; inorganic phosphorus from 78 percent to 63 percent; oil
pollutants from 63 percent to 57 percent, and COD from 13.6
percent to zero.
</P>
<P>
However, marine environment experts say that the ocean
pollution situation is still serious around the Dagukou and
Beitangkou river outlets.
</P>
<P>
The sea near Tianjin, near the lower end of Bohai Bay, covers
an area of 3,000-sq.km., into which the city discharges about 500
million tons of waste water each year, and marine oil exploration
and transportation make the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
The city has built three waste water treatment plants to handle
more than 40 percent of the city's waste water, and industrial
pollution has been reduced since the city closed a large number of
polluting enterprises. More than 80 percent of the city's
industrial waste water is treated and over 65 percent is up to
discharge standards, Cui told reporters.
</P>
<P>
All new enterprises have been told that they need to be
equipped with environmental protection facilities in the 1990s,
and the city will close all other polluters that don't meet
standards by next year.

<HEADLINE> White House: Closer Military Contacts With China on Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Closer military-to-military
contacts between the United States and China are "coming on line,"
said White House Spokesman Michael McCurry on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The development, McCurry told a press briefing here, is part of
the efforts to establish U.S.-China strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
When Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States
last October, the idea was discussed and "some of those things are
coming on line now," said the spokesman, who accompanied
U.S. President Bill Clinton in his recent visit to China.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the two countries have agreed to hold the first
annual meeting of the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement
Forum later this month, so as to promote safety in naval and air
operations and avoid incidents at sea.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have agreed to carry out search and rescue
operations together and exchange military observers to observe
military exercises on a reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
Military officials are also going to work on how the two sides
could work to de-conflict operations if they are responding to
some kind of national disaster.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of senior military observers and military visits
have served the purpose of helping both our sides understand
better the ways in which their militaries operate and project
force in a very sensitive region," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that closer military-to-military contact "has the
benefit of reducing tensions, of helping people understand better
what the military strategies of both sides are."
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Pentagon Spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon confirmed
that the United States and China have been working on ways to
improve military-to-military relationships since December 1996,
when Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian visited Washington. The
theme was discussed many times between the two sides later on.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the two countries had joint search-and-rescue air
exercises out of Hong Kong last December and a same exercise is
scheduled for this December involving the Hong Kong Civil Aviation
Department, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton flew back home last weekend from a nine-day
visit to China, where an agreement was reached on reciprocal
observer missions watching joint exercises in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the next weeks and months, Bacon said, representatives
from China and the United States will sit down to work out a
schedule in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He called the move "new and a breakthrough," and actually "a
rather important confidence-building measure."
</P>
<P>
At the U.S. State Department, Spokesman James Rubin commented
Tuesday that both on humanitarian grounds and in terms of
preventing unwanted risks and miscalculation, "these kind of
greater military-to-military contacts are of benefit both to the
security of the United States and to the Chinese as well."

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for More New Building Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have called for
increased production of new building materials in order to improve
the level of the country's thriving construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Today's edition of People's Daily reported that China
initiated the development of new building materials in 1979, but
is nonetheless far behind developed countries in the use of
related products.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the output value for new building
materials accounts for a mere 15 percent of the gross value for
related products.
</P>
<P>
For example, new waterproof materials are being used only in a
five percent of construction projects, compared to a usage rate of
between 75-90 percent in some foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
New insulation materials are used in 10 percent of projects,
with the usage rate for wallboard standing at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that the increased use of new wallboard and
materials will help the nation conserve arable land.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The central government and Sichuan
provincial government plan to earmark billions of yuan over the
next few years to develop transportation infrastructure in the
southwest China province.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Provincial Governor Zou Guangyan said that the state will
invest more than 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) in
railway construction between 1996-2000. And railways stretching
347 km have been added in the last two years alone.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sichuan will spend additional 4.15 billion yuan (500
million US dollars) to accelerate four railway projects, including
the multi-track railway from the city of Baoji to Chengdu, the
provincial capital of Sichuan, and the Chengdu-Kunming and
Chongqing-Daxian electrified railways. The railways are planned to
enter operations in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Plans through the year 2000 call for Sichuan to build new
expressways stretching 1,000 km. Recent reports indicate that
Sichuan has completed expressways covering 341 km in the past two
years, and the provincial government plans to allocate some 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) for related construction
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among other communications projects on the provincial
government agenda are an expansion project of Shuangliu Airport to
accommodate Boeing 747 with an annual flow of 13 million
passengers and construction of Mianyang, Jiuzhai and Huanglong
airports.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The city government of Guangzhou
in south China's Guangdong Province adopted a resolution on Monday
allowing the private sector to conduct foreign trade and economic
cooperative activities.
</P>
<P>
This is the country's first official effort to encourage the
sector to get involved in a field long dominated by state-owned
businesses.

Private businesses will be able to set up joint ventures with
overseas investors, and related government departments should
provide necessary services, according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Private firms can conduct foreign trade independently after

Those private companies that have the status of "legal person"
will receive the same favorable policies as state-owned
enterprises in conducting processing business supplied by foreign
partners.
</P>
<P>
The city also will organize trade inspection groups for the
sector to participate in world trade fairs and also provide

<HEADLINE> Beijing Further Strengthens Emission Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Spots checks on vehicles in the
Chinese capital are helping to make the air a little easier to
breathe, China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
In the three months from April 1 to the end of June, roadside
checks were carried out on more than 17,000 automobiles and 55
percent of them needed to have catalytic converters installed.
</P>
<P>
The spot checks are aimed at encouraging car drivers to keep up
maintenance of their vehicles to reduce exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
Li Tiejun, an official with the Beijing Environmental
Protection Bureau, disclosed that the percentage points of
automobiles reaching state standards in tail-gas emissions had
climbed gradually since the beginning of the check, possibly
because some car drivers were taking measures to maintain their
cars better.
</P>
<P>
The municipal environmental protection bureau has set up four
mobile inspection teams in Beijing's eight urban districts to
carry out daily spot checks on tail-gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the spot checks and the installation of
catalytic converters were just end-of-pipe control measures. A
significant improvement in tail-gas emissions could only be
achieved during the car-manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
In a tail-gas sampling survey of ten different models of new
cars, Beijing's environmental protection bureau found that only
Red Flag, Cherokee and Audi cars met all the state standards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 80 percent of the lead in the capital
city's air, 63 percent of tis carbon monoxide and 37 percent of
its nitrogen oxide come from tail gas.

<HEADLINE> Largest U.S. Human Rights Group on Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The largest U.S. human rights
group Tuesday blamed the governments at various levels in the
United States for turning a blind eye to chronic and widespread
brutality by police officers.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch, releasing a 440-page report on police
behavior in 14 cities, said the brutality was one of the most
serious, enduring and divisive human rights violations in the
United States. It said members of the black and Hispanic
minorities were the victims in disproportionate numbers.
</P>
<P>
"Police officers engage in unjustified shootings, severe
beatings, fatal chokings and unnecessarily rough physical
treatment in cities throughout the United States," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Their police superiors, city officials and the Justice
Department fail to act decisively to restrain or penalize such
acts or even record the magnitude of the problem," it added.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to launch the report, Kenneth Roth,
executive director of Human Rights Watch, said the United States'
record at home could damage the government's efforts to push for
improved human rights abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that the U.S. government's failure to address this
serious human rights problem risks undermining U.S. credibility in
addressing human rights abuses in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to make America's official tolerance of police
brutality the international scandal it should be," he added.
</P>
<P>
One recommendation in Human Rights Watch report is that the
Justice Department comply with a 1994 congressional requirement
that it collect data on police use of excessive force.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch recommended the federal government make
grants to police forces dependent on regular reporting and
improvements in oversight and discipline. It added that each
state should appoint a special prosecutor to deal with police
officers accused of human rights violations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Organized to Solve Their Own Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
farmers are no longer worried about selling their crops now that
farmers' associations are there to help them solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Weizhuang Township of Chengxian County in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, for example, are eagerly awaiting their
apple harvest because a local fruit association has guaranteed the
sales.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, local growers called their fruit "bitter apples"
because of marketing problems. Later, they organized among
themselves a farmers' fruit association to take charge of product
sales.
</P>
<P>
Now, the association has organized a marketing force of more
than 50 people, and established some information networks and
sales outlets in coastal areas and other parts of the country. So,
what is left for farmers is to take good care of their fruit.
</P>
<P>
As a result, farmers now call their fruit "golden apples," and
the association is widely accepted and trusted as it also provides
other services and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Fruits Growers' Association in Fengxiang County has opened
16 branches in villages as well as more than 50 sales outlets
elsewhere. By now, it has sold more than 30 million kilograms of
apples for farmers.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas of Qingdao in Shandong Province, east China,
farmers have formed 1,749 associations involving more than 70,000
members. While in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, herdsmen also
joined the effort, and set up some 1,000 technical associations.
</P>
<P>
Such associations in Yanshi in Henan Province have gone so far
as to send farmers to the local agricultural university for
training or to invite experts to give lectures and
guidance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- EAS International Transportation
Ltd, an established Chinese cargo shipper, announced yesterday
that it will use a high-tech computer network to process customs
claims at its Beijing center.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Wang Beipei, EAS general manager as
saying that "the establishment of the center will redue operation
costs and increase efficiency for both our company and our clients.
</P>
<P>
The computer network, the first international cargo forwarder
to ever get approval from Beijing Customs to launch such a
facility, which links customs, banks, airlines, cargo owners.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be far more advanced and streamlined than
traditional handing customs declaration and taxation by hand.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the EAS operates transportation business in 98
cities at home and 120 nations and regions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junyin, deputy director of Beijing Customs, said "we plan
to increase the proportion of computerized customs clearances to
total documents for import and export managed to up to 50 percent."
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Beijing Customs has started a pilot project using
the advanced system to handle customs clearance.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Find Philippines Attractive:Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines continues to be
attractive to foreign investors despite the ill-effects of the
ongoing regional financial crisis, Business World said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting a survey conducted among 84 chief
executive officers of multinational corporations based in the
country, said the Philippines was regarded as the third most
politically stable country next to Australia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Most of the respondents believed that President Joseph Estrada
was sincere in his efforts to strengthen the economy despite the
ongoing Asian financial crisis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors also believed that Estrada would continue
the economic policies and reforms initiated by his predecessor,
former president Fidel Ramos, but he would only be "partially
successful" in implementing these policies and reforms.
</P>
<P>
The challenge for the administration lies on its ability and
commitment to not only sustain the momentum of reform the Ramos
administration has started, but also ensure its proper
implementation, said Peter Wallace who made the survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wallace noted that the international community
continued to see the Philippines as the least affected by the
regional financial crisis and lauded the measures the country took
to handle the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Workers Slow in Using Legal Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's ordinary workers are slow in
using legal means to protect their rights compared with business
people, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
While most law firms dealing with commercial cases enjoy good
business, few handle exclusively labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
One major reason is that most workers involved in labor disputes
are simply unaware of legal protection and turning to law firms
for help, according to Han Zhili, of Beijing Labor Dispute
Arbitration Committee.
</P>
<P>
A lot of them ask elementary questions such as "What is listed
in the Labor Law?" on a new labor dispute hot line opened by Han's
committee.
</P>
<P>
The line has been busy since the number -- 26677160 -- was made
public in recent TV programs. More than 200 people called over the
weekend, which was the fourth anniversary of the passing of the
law.
</P>
<P>
But, Han is quoted as saying, many people rang only to find
that the period during which litigation was allowed had expired.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, people have been accustomed to talking their
disputes over with their employers and superiors instead of paying
some thousand yuan for a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that since China
restored its system of lawyers in 1979, the country has about
8,400 law firms with over 100,000 lawyers.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges U.S. to Ease Cuba Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman Sir Leon Brittan
of the European Union Commission said on Tuesday that the U.S.
Congress should approve a legislation to ease U.S. sanctions on
foreign companies doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Press Club here, Brittan said that if
the U.S. Congress eased restrictions, the 15-nation European Union
(EU) would avoid investing in companies holding assets that
include U.S. property seized by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
The EU made the obligation under an agreement, which was
reached last May with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the U.S. would grant European companies
permanent waivers to the Helms-Burton law while the EU agreed to
join in creating a global registry of property confiscated by Cuba
and other governments that would remain off-limits to investors.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law, which was proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms
and Rep. Dan Burton, needs to be amended to guarantee the waivers
for the EU. But the prospect appears to be slim.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. Congress did not act, "the pressure would be
enormous" to return the dispute to the World Trade Organization
(WT), said Brittan.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans suspended their action before the WTO in the
spring of 1997 to allow time for negotiations with the
administration.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Tuesday that he was shocked by the news of the sudden
death of Nigeria's detained politician Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
An official statement from Nigeria's presidency said Abiola,
detained since 1994 when he declared himself president, died of
apparent heart attack Tuesday during a meeting with Nigerian
officials and members of a visiting U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian government has confirmed to me this afternoon the
death today of Moshood Abiola," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he had expected Abiola's imminent release,
along with other detainees, and the beginning of a process to
restore democratic civilian rule to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to his family. I wish to express to them my
sincerest condolence," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the Government of Nigeria would make good on its
pledge to release all remaining political prisoners
unconditionally and to define a credible process for the
democratic transition to civilian rule within a reasonable time
frame," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Hockey Czar Freed after Six Months in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's disgraced hockey czar Alan
Eagleson came out of jail Tuesday on parole six months into an
18-month sentence for fraud.
</P>
<P>
Eagleson, 65, walked out of a correction center west of Toronto
early Tuesday morning and didn't make any comments before driving
away, reports said.
</P>
<P>
As a condition of his release, Eagleson will have to report to
a probation officer for 12 months, and is forbidden to leave the
province he is living during that year.
</P>
<P>
A former player agent and founder of the NHL Players'
Association, Eagleson pleaded guilty in Boston, the United States,
on January 6 to three counts of fraud and theft. He was fined one
million Canadian dollars (680,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On January 7, he also pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud
in the Canadian city of Toronto and agreed to an 18-month jail
term.
</P>
<P>
Eagleson has since been stripped of both his order of Canada
honor and membership in Canada's Sports Hall of Frame. He also
resigned from the country's Hockey Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
For the last two months, he has been on day parole working in a
sheet metal factory.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to continue working there for the next three to
six months, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Senator Fined for Influence-Peddling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Senator Michel Cogger was
fined Tuesday 3,000 Canadian dollars (2,040 U.S. dollars) after he
was convicted last month for influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
He was also put on 12 months' probation and order to do
community service for 120 hours, reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still unclear whether Cogger will be stripped of
his status in the upper chamber of the Canadian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Cogger was convicted of lobbying government for a private
client for two years after he was named to the Senate in May,
1986, by then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
His client, businessman Guy Montpetit, was reported to have
paid him 212,000 dollars in an unsuccessful bid for a
45-million-dollar government subsidy.
</P>
<P>
The client was convicted two months ago of buying Cogger's
influence, got a suspended sentence and was order to do 240 hours
of community work.
</P>
<P>
On his first trial in 1993, Cogger was acquitted on the grounds
he had no criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court of Canada ruled last year that the
senator must face a new trial.

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Croatian striker Davor Suker has sung
praises for his coach Miroslav Blazevic.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout his career, Blazevic has proven his exceptional talent.
With all his achievements, he has succeeded in bringing the players,
the fans, and the media together," said Suker on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Because of his psychological approach to the game, he
has been able to be flexible with us thoughout our 50-day stay here.
He's been everything but a dictator."
</P>
<P>
Suker said France may have sapped their energy after playing two of
their games into extra time.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have an advantage over France because two of their
matches have gone into extra time and so they've spent more energy...
We have 50-50 chance of winning the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sukor said he has got tips from teammate Zvonimir Boban on Marcel
Desailly if the French defender marks him in Wednesday's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Boban and Desailly are playing together in the Italian club side AC
Milan.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am not concentrating on being the top scorer, my
objective is to play in the final.
</P>
<P>
"Asking me if I am happy to be in the semifinals is a dumb question
-- a player at this level is not happy just participating. He's here
to win."

<HEADLINE> Third Night of Violence in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Protestant Orangemen
paraded in central Belfast as disturbances and protests continued
across Northern Ireland on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
By early Tuesday evening police reported widespread road
blocking, some vehicle hijackings and stone throwing by
pro-British loyalist gangs.
</P>
<P>
A bus was hijacked and set on fire in Belfast's Donegal Road
and cars burnt in North Queen Street.
</P>
<P>
In the most serious incident, a bomb was thrown at a police
patrol in Carrickfergus in County Antrim, but there were no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The riots across the divided province were touched off by the
banning of Orangemen from parading on Sunday through a Roman
Catholic part of Portadown. The marchers, however, continued their
parade in defiance of the ruling of the independent Parades
Commission. More than 40 police have been injured over the last
three days.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to bolster the political process, Prime Minister Tony
Blair agreed on Tuesday to meet leaders of the Orange Order on
Thursday but said the parade ban was not open for discussion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Changes Procedures for Generals' Retirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army has decided on
full disclosure of any problems or allegations that a military man
or woman may be facing at the time when such persons requests
retirement, a Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, there has to be full disclosure of any problems
or allegations that a person may be facing at the time he or she
requests retirement," spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters at a
Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when the Army's former deputy inspector
general, Maj. Gen. David Hale, was allowed to retire by Army Chief
of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer, even though Hale was being
investigated for possible improper conduct.
</P>
<P>
U.S. lawmakers have questioned whether a double standard exists
for higher-level officers who are allowed to retire while
lower-ranking military service men and women have faced harsher
treatment amid allegations of sexual misconduct, an Associated
Press report said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a separate investigation by the Pentagon's inspector
general concluded that Hale "engaged in a pattern of inappropriate
behavior" with the wives of four subordinates while he was the top
American military officer at a NATO base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Army announced last week that it was opening a criminal
investigation of Hale, 53, who retired earlier this year after
serving only four months as the Army's deputy inspector general.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Advance into Final with Penalty Shoot-out Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MARSEILLE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Brazil
advanced into the final after penalty shoot-out in a semi-final
match here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played to a 1-1 draw after 90-minute regulation
time and failed to produce a golden goal in the extra time.
</P>
<P>
In the penalty shoot-out, the Brazilian team proved they were
better technically as they converted all their first four shots.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Brazilian goal-keeper Taffarel also proved
he was definitely among the best goal-keepers in the world as he
punched out the shots by Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer.
</P>
<P>
It is the second match decided by penalty shoot-out. The first
one was between England and Argentina in the second round which was
won by Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the match, the Dutch team took an upper
hand as they dominated the midfield and produced handful of scoring
chances.
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Kluivert failed to grasp any of the chances as he
time and again headed the ball over the cross-bar.
</P>
<P>
After a 0-0 first half, the Dutch team suffered a blow only 21
seconds into the second half when Ronaldo scored with his first
attempt to put Brazil 1-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
But the Dutch team refused to give up and they finally hit in
the equaliser at the 87th minute through a header from Kluivert.
</P>
<P>
The extra-time was more exciting than the regulation time as
Ronaldo suddenly found his form and beat the Dutch defence line
several times.
</P>
<P>
But Edwin van der Sar, the Dutch goal-keeper, came to his team's
rescue and punched out Ronaldo's shots and took the match into
penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians are a better and luckier team in the penalty
shoot-out and that means they are just one match away from their
fifth World Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will play the final against the winners of another
semi-final match between Croatia and hosts France.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unhappy over U.N. Upgrading Palestinian Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it regretted a vote by the U.N. General Assembly to
upgrade the status of the Palestinian U.N. representation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly
to upgrade the Palestinian observer mission to a new, unique
status of a non-voting member in the 185-member assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We regret this decision. We think this was a mistake. We
think that this decision undermines the chances of bringing
peace to the Middle East," State Department spokesman James
Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"This is a unilateral action that we believe was unnecessary
and untimely, not to mention the precedent we think it
unfortunately set for those in the observer category at the
United Nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The vote on the resolution was 124 to four which include the
United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was disappointed that only four
countries opposed the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said supporters of the move "didn't understand the fact
that the way to make peace in the Middle East is to promote
dialogue between the two parties and not to pursue symbolic
steps that may feel good but do not do good."
</P>
<P>
Nasser al-Kidwa, the Palestinian U.N. observer, said the vote
"makes us feel proud, strengthens our convictions of the justice
of our cause and increases our confidence that right could still
be achieved in our contemporary world."
