<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Eating Chinese food and riding
a bicycle are nothing in particular for the Chinese, but seem to
symbolize a special feeling for former US President George Bush
about the most populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who served as head of the US Liaison Office in
Beijing from 1974 to 1975, became acquainted with China and its
people by tasting Chinese food and riding down streets and alleys
in Beijing on a bicycle. Even in his 1988-1992 presidential
tenure, Bush used to eat in Chinese restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years have passed, and the 74-year-old Bush, who
has visited China each year since stepping down as president in
1992, still pays close attention to Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Bush serves as honorary president of the China program of the
Volunteer Organization of America (VOA), which dispatches dozens
of US experts to China each year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush, together with former Chairman of the US Joint
Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, supports another program concerning
personnel exchanges between China and the US, in which Chinese
scholars are invited to the US.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who came to Beijing this time for a seminar on the Asian
financial crisis held on Tuesday, told the seminar that China has
received real recognition both for its active engagement in
providing "tangible assistance" to help regional economies
recover, and for its willingness to made the "tough decision" not
to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese economy will have a growing impact on
the global economy because of its size and growth rate, noting
that China's integration into the global economy will enable the
country to play an even greater role in terms of politics,
economy and security.
</P>
<P>
China has a lot of friends around the world, who praise China's
major role in dealing with the financial crisis, he said. "I am
one of them," he added. Bush wished China success in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is wise for the US to pursue a policy of active
engagement with China. He noted that a sound US-China
relationship is critical to world peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to China will "give a
strong push forward to the bilateral relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he believes that conducting more personnel exchanges
is very important for the promotion of mutual understanding between
the two influential countries with different social systems and
traditions.
</P>
<P>
The governments and non-governmental organizations of the two
countries should continue to make efforts in this area, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bush, a grandfather of 14, said that he hopes that his
grandchildren and Chinese children will live in a peaceful world
in the new century.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit to China is Right For U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here Thursday that his visit to China is the right thing to
do since China is making substantial progress in many different
fields and is fulfilling an important role in world and regional
peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Geographic Society, Clinton said that
over the past 25 years, China has entered a period of profound
change, "Emerging from isolation, turning a closed economy into an
engine for growth, increasing cooperation with the rest of the
world, and raising the standard of living for hundreds of millions
of its citizens."
</P>
<P>
He said China also has played a major role in safeguarding
peace in the Korean peninsula, throughout Asia and the rest of the
world as well.
</P>
<P>
It is notable that China has played a positive role in
stabilizing the Asian financial situation at a time when there is
an economic crisis there, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president also appreciated China's role in preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, in combating international
crime and drug trafficking, and in protecting the environment.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Announces Moratorium on Nuclear Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday announced a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing two weeks after the
country carried out its own nuclear tests in response to such
tests by neighboring rival India.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government, which repeatedly stated that it does
not wish to enter into an arms race with India, is making active
efforts to ensure avoidance of conflict and promote nuclear and
conventional restraint and stabilization measures between the two
countries, the Foreign Office said in a press statement Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that the government of Pakistan has
decided to announce a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to engage constructively with India and other
members of the international community to formalize this
arrangement," it said.
</P>
<P>
"In the first instance, we are ready to arrive at a no-nuclear
test agreement with India, as an important confidence building
measure at the regional level," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan expresses the hope that India will reciprocate and
contribute toward creating a conducive regional environment by
taking further effective steps to overcome the security crisis and
promote durable peace and stability in South Asia," it said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leader Calls for Regional Integration in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An ASEAN leader said here
Thursday that regional integration and cooperation are much needed
in pulling the battered Southeast Asian economies out of the
current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo C. Severino, secretary-general of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), told an economic conference:
"Today's crises and challenges call for tighter integration,
closer cooperation and stronger solidarity in ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Since ASEAN was founded 31 years ago, no disaster has hit the
Southeast Asian countries with such widespread impact as the
financial crisis, which first struck Thailand in July last year
and then spilled over to neighboring economies.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN has strongly reaffirmed its commitment to regional
economic integration and open regionalism," said the
secretary-general here Thursday at the Far Eastern Economic
Review's annual conference, adding that member countries are
continuing their efforts in building the ASEAN Free Trade Area,
which is now on the verge of completion.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, ASEAN countries have agreed to establish an economic
monitoring mechanism to keep track of capital flows and other
macroeconomic indicators and to use ASEAN currencies, instead of
hard currency, for the settlement of intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
Saying today's challenge is that of globalization, the ASEAN
official stressed: "ASEAN's response to global challenges has to
be not greater national assertiveness, as countries might normally
have reacted in the past, but greater regional integration and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He finally pointed out that the effectiveness of ASEAN's
response to the new challenges depends to a large extent on
Indonesia, the largest country in Southeast Asia, where political
uncertainty still exists.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from Clinton's China Policy Speech At NGS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are excerpts from the
speech made by U.S. President Bill Clinton on China policies at
the National Geographic Society on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
As all of you know, I will go to China in two weeks' time. It
will be the first state visit by an American president this
decade. I'm going because I think it's the right thing to do for
our country.
</P>
<P>
Today I want to talk with you about our relationship with China
and how it fits into our broader concerns for the world of the
21st century and our concerns in particular for developments in
Asia. That relationship will, in large measure, help to determine
whether the new century is one of security, peace, and prosperity
for the American people.
</P>
<P>
Let me say that all of you know the dimensions, but I think it
is worth repeating a few of the facts about China. It is already
the most populous nation. It will increase by the size of
America's current population every 20 years. Its vast territory
borders 15 countries. It has one of the fastest-growing economies
on earth. It holds a permanent seat on the National Security
Council of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, it has entered a period of profound
change, emerging from isolation, turning a closed economy into an
engine for growth, increasing cooperation with the rest of the
world, raising the standard of living for hundreds of millions of
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The role China chooses to play in preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction or encouraging it, in combating or
ignoring international crime and drug trafficking, in protecting
or degrading the environment, in tearing down or building up trade
barriers, in respecting or abusing human rights; in resolving
difficult situations in Asia, from the Indian subcontinent to the
Korean peninsula, or aggravating them; the role China chooses to
play will powerfully shape the next century.
</P>
<P>
A stable, open, prosperous China that assumes its
responsibilities for building a more peaceful world is clearly and
profoundly in our interests. On that point, all Americans agree.
But as we all know, there is serious disagreement over how best to
encourage the emergence of that kind of China and how to handle
our differences, especially over human rights, in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain
China because of its undemocratic system and human-rights
violations, and in order to retard its capacity to become
America's next great enemy. Some believe increased commercial
dealings alone will inevitably lead to a more open, more
democratic China.
</P>
<P>
We have chosen a different course that I believe to be both
principled and pragmatic, expanding our areas of cooperation with
China, while dealing forthrightly with our differences. This
policy is supported by our key democratic allies in Asia; Japan,
South Korea, Australia, Thailand and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Get in Line With EURO II Emission Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Starting July 1, imported
vehicles with emission limits higher than accepted in the European
Union, will no longer be matriculated in Romania.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the drastic measures taken by the Romanian
government to reduce emission of nocivious substances.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage, the imported cars, either new cars or
second-hand ones, will have to meet EU norms of pollutant
emissions for the period 1995-1998, namely EURO II norms. Measures
concerning Romanian cars, of which 80 percent are Dacia brand,
will be gradually implemented.
</P>
<P>
The cars already in circulation will run with their current
emission level until January 1, 2000, when the Romanians will have
to set to their cars the Bosch pollution avoiding system in order
to line up with the EURO II norms.

<HEADLINE> HK Takes Action Against Marine Pollution: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has taken various
steps to improve the marine environment for the past several years
and in future these efforts will continue, a Hong Kong official
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The work of enforcing legislation, building better environment
protection infrastructure and planning better to prevent pollution
will continue unabated," Secretary for Planning, Environment and
Lands Bowen Leung told an international conference.
</P>
<P>
"The sea is a major part of our life support system, not a sink
into which we can endlessly pour our waste without heed of
consequences," the official told the second International
Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology at the City
University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This is a truth which is relatively easy for Hong Kong, a city
built by the sea, to understand, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has already enacted the Dumping at Sea Ordinance to
prevent damage to the marine environment by dumping of waste into
local water, brought all of the coastal waters under the
comprehensive pollution controls provided by the Water Pollution
Control Ordinance, extended controls over livestock waste disposal
to cover the whole territory and built a sewage disposal
infrastructure, the official said.
</P>
<P>
With these measures, "we have seen significant improvements in
river quality and steady improvements in beach water conditions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, marine water quality in Victoria Harbor
has continued to deteriorate, entrophication remains a serious
problem and pollution of local waters by toxic substance has
become a cause of increasing concern.
</P>
<P>
"Building up knowledge about these issues and about techniques
for assessing the risks in order to establish control policies is
a key part of the work we are now doing," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong
province on the Chinese mainland are working closely to study the
environmental problems in the Pearl River Delta region as a whole
and to plan for sounder, more effective environmental management.

Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who arrived here this
morning by plane from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both China and Italy are countries with ancient

cultural relics, and said that he looked forward to more bilateral

renovation of historical and cultural relics, where he met with
dozens of experts from both sides and praised their work.
</P>
<P>
He said that the work being done by these experts once again
proved that there were links between the two peoples in ancient
times, and that such cooperation is a good way to enhance their
friendship and mutual understanding.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Historical Trend on Healthy Growth of Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin had
a successful state visit to the United States last fall, marking
the advent of a new era in Sino-U.S. relations. Amidst the sound
and stable growth of Sino-U.S. relations, the U.S. House of
Representatives, disregarding the consistent stance of the Chinese
government and the commitment by every U.S. administration after
1972, approved a motion last Tuesday in which it required
President Bill Clinton during his upcoming China visit to impose
pressure on the country and force it to abandon non-peaceful means
for the liberation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is not only a bold move which interferes in China's
internal affairs but also sets barriers against further developing
the improved Sino-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that the Taiwan issue, the most
important and sensitive problem in China-U.S. relations, will be
an unavoidable topic during the China-U.S. summit between Jiang
and Clinton due later this month.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Sino-U.S. Joint Statement signed by the two heads
of state at the previous Washington summit has already
demonstrated the basic stance of the two governments in this
regard. The Chinese side in the statement underlined that the key
to healthy and stable Sino-U.S. ties is to properly handle the
Taiwan issue in accordance with the three joint communiques signed
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The American side reiterated that the U.S. side adheres to "One
China" stand and observes the three communiques. President Clinton
and the U.S. government also clearly elaborated that the United
States did not support "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan",
nor the independence of Taiwan, or Taiwan's entry into the United
Nations.

Movement.
</P>
<P>
Liang Sili, son of Liang Qichao, one of the initiators of the
reform, also came to the exhibition with his wife.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Guangxu's edict, the petition the reformers submitted
to the emperor and many other related items on display are
original historical archives and relics.
</P>
<P>
"Look, this is the letter of appointment for my father issued
by Emperor Guangxu," Liang said to his wife.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 19th century, young Emperor Guangxu appointed
Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao and other officials to important
positions to carry out all-round political, economic and cultural
reform in order to avert the national crisis in which China faced
being partitioned by Western imperialist powers.
</P>
<P>
"I was only five years old when my father died, and I am not
very familiar with that period of history," said Liang, who is now
an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said, "My father's most profound influence on me was to
encourage me to strive to make China prosperous and strong, and
fear no dangers and difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The reform was carried out for only 103 days, until September
21, when Empress Dowager Cixi staged a palace coup. Emperor
Guangxu was put into house arrest, and many reformers were
arrested. Six noted "scholars" were executed, whereas Kang Youwei,
Liang Qichao and a few other reformers fled China and went into
exile in Japan.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Tax Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's people's courts at various
levels have finished trying 5,917 cases of tax evasion and
resistance, and sentenced 4,241 serious criminals, since the law
on the management of taxation was promulgated five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Luo Haocai, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, said
here today that the people's courts have consistently taken the
crackdown on tax crimes as the major task over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Cooperating with the taxation, procuratorial and public
security departments, the courts at various levels have launched
special campaigns to combat crimes on tax evasion and resistance,
as well as illicit issuing of value-added tax notices.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Supreme People's Court, the State General
Administration of Taxation, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and
the Ministry of Public Security have established a system of regular
meetings to exchange information to fight against tax crimes.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the people's courts actively accepted cases submitted
by the taxation organs on compulsory enforcement of delaying
payment of taxes and fines.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1997, the courts accepted a total of 8,153
cases submitted by the taxation organs in this regard, involving a
sum of nearly 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress has decided to conduct a nationwide inspection of tax
collecting and management in July.

<HEADLINE> Pollution on Qomolangma Causes Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The pollution on the highest
mountain in the world, Mt. Qomolangma, which was brought about by
an increased number of tourists and mountain climbers, has caused
public concern.
</P>
<P>
This reporter paid a visit last month to the base camp some
5,200 m above sea level, finding that the place was littered with
plastic boxes, drink bottles and waste paper left by visitors,
despite the fact that a garbage station has been set up.
</P>
<P>
"The site was grassland in 1972, when I first came here. But
there isn't any grass now," Yu Liangpu, secretary general of the
China Mountaineering Association, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that man has set foot on every corner of the earth and
his activities are inevitably re-shaping the environment.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 tourists, mountain climbers and scientists
visited Mt. Qomolangma last year.
</P>
<P>
Dobuje, deputy director of the Dingri County Administration
Bureau of the Qomolangma Nature Reserve, said that China has taken
measures to protect the environment in the region, and that he is
optismistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he recalled, the Tibet Autonomous Region set up
offices to oversee the environmental protection work around
Mt. Qomolangma, and the government has sent teams regularly to
collect rubbish left by climbers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 30 tons of garbage was moved down from the
mountain, he said, adding that "it is hard to find any rubbish on
the mountain itself now."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that oxygen bottles left at sites some 7,000 m
above sea level have not been disposed.
</P>
<P>
The local government is asking climbers to pay environmental
protection fees if they want to climb the mountain. In addition,
six core protection zones have been established where hunting and
tree felling are strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Dobuje said that some rare animals, including
snow leopards, wolves and antelopes, have returned to the foot of
the mountain recently.
</P>
<P>
"One of the urgent tasks is to spread environmental protection
information among local residents and tourists," Dobuje said.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Calls for Study of Deng Xiaoping's Theory on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that leading officials and all the people in the
educational field should take the study of Deng Xiaoping's theory
on education as an urgent task.
</P>
<P>
Attending a seminar on the study of Deng's theory on education,
which was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Li
urged leading officials at various levels to make a conscientious
study of Deng's theory, carry out the strategy of revitalizing the
nation with science and education, and do a better job of
educational reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, noted that
Deng's theory on education is a key component of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and a guideline for the country's socialist educational
task in the new period.
</P>
<P>
Deng gave great attention to education and took education and
scientific and technological development as strategic matters
concerning China's modernization and the fate of socialism
in China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory on education, China's
educational reform has been well under way over the past two
decades, and fast-developing education has made remarkable
contributions to the growth of the national economy, scientific and
technological advancement and social progress, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the study of Deng Xiaoping's theory on
education must be done in line with the practical and effective
implementation of the theory.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Closer cooperation between the
municipalities of Shanghai and Chongqing will not only boost their

central and western regions as well as the areas along the Yangtze
River, said the two municipalities' leaders.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of

Shanghai and Chongqing will help boost the development and opening
of cities along the Yangtze River, and accelerate the optimization
of the essential factors of production and the process of economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai has now more than 120 enterprises
funded by Chongqing, while it has launched nearly 100
cooperation projects in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
After discussion, they decided to increase cooperation in four
aspects, namely, the development of high-tech products, the
establishment of transregional large enterprises, infrastructural
construction, and market fostering.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Business Leader Confident of HK's Recovery (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese business leader
expressed here Thursday his confidence that Hong Kong would once
again sail through the current economic turbulence as it did
before.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, said Thursday morning that Hong Kong will rebound
from the current Asian financial turmoil sooner than most of the
Asian countries due to its own advantages and its special
relations with China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the morning session of the fifth annual conference
of the Far Eastern Economic Review, Jing, who is also
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, said Hong Kong will have a
brighter future but it will have to go through some kind of
adjustment as it did previously.
</P>
<P>
Jing noted that Hong Kong, like any other places in the world,
has not been immune to the financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Jing, who first came to Hong Kong right after he graduated from
 college in 1939 and has been to the region many times since
then, said he has seen how Hong Kong rode out a number of troubles
 such as recession, stock market crashes and bank failures in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter of this year saw a negative growth in Hong
Kong," Jing said. "This is also nothing new at all."
</P>
<P>
A similar situation arose in the mid-1970s and again in the
mid-1980s, not to speak of the earlier days, Jing recalled. But
Hong Kong was not down on its knees, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Like a man falling sick, Hong Kong, after making a painful
adjustment, including belt tightening, became healthier and
competitive again in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The reason that Hong Kong always has not only survived but also
pushed ahead lies in the people of Hong Kong, who are talented and
resilient, always ready to rise to challenges.

<P>
Different from most of the Southeast Asian nations, here in
Hong Kong, most of its fundamentals are good, Jing said.
</P>
<P>
They include the institutional and regulatory framework, the
rule of law, the free market economy, good infrastructure and the
world's third largest foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Above all, serving as an important bridge between China and the
rest of the world gives Hong Kong advantages not available to
others, Jing stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jing said that to deal with the financial turmoil in Asia and
ensure the success of China's further economic reform, the Chinese
government has set for this year the objectives of keeping the
nation's economic growth rate at 8 percent, the inflation rate at
less than 3 percent and the national currency RMB's exchange rate
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The three objectives combined are designed to keep China moving
on the track of "high growth, low inflation and progress with
stability."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has the advantage of extensive business and
information networks, which are extremely sensitive to customer
needs, market opportunities and the global trend of new and high
technology development.
</P>
<P>
It will thus be able to play a great role in helping the
Chinese mainland's overall economic development in the next five,
10 or 15 years, Jing said.
</P>
<P>
Jing noted that the current financial turmoil has a negative
impact on both the China's mainland and Hong Kong's economies
and the adjustment period will be even painful to many people who
are affected by the storm and the subsequent measures of reform
and adjustment.
</P>
<P>
"However, I firmly believe that China's mainland and Hong Kong
will zoom ahead like a jumbo jet irrespective of occasional
turbulence," Jing said to the dozens of local and foreign business
leaders present at the conference.

"Although the reform was aborted, for the first time in China's
2,000-year feudalistic history, it set forth the idea of reform
and took the first step toward modernization," said Qin Guojing, a
historian visiting the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yan Hongbin, one of the organizers of the
exhibition, noted that China has suffered lots of setbacks in its
100-year-long modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the ongoing political and economic reform
and opening-up, initiated two decades ago, is sure to succeed, for
it is under the correct direction of a collective leadership which
enjoys wide support from the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
"This is the major difference between the ongoing reform and
the one initiated 100 years ago," Yan said, adding that the reform
and opening-up awareness of the whole nation is the guarantee for
the success of the country's current reform and opening-up.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Historical Trend on Healthy Growth of Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government has repeatedly announced its willingness
to reunify the country by peaceful means, but cannot undertake not
to use armed means to resolve the Taiwan issue. The stance of the
Chinese government in this regard is targeted at foreign
interference and so-called "Taiwan independence" instead of the
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
It is the set guideline for reunifying China by peaceful
means. However, every sovereign state has the right to take all
means it deems essential, including military means, to safeguard
its national sovereignty and territorial integration. On how to
handle its internal affairs, the Chinese government is not obliged
to make any commitment to any foreign country or any party,
especially those aiming to split China.
</P>
<P>
Many far-sighted people in the U.S. hold that Sino-US relations
would be stalled, and even see some setbacks if the Taiwan issue
is beset with troubles. Such a move is itself not in the realistic
and long-term interest of the U.S. They suggest that the U.S. look
squarely at China's position on the Taiwan question, effectively
observe the Sino-U.S. joint communiques and Sino-US Joint
Statement as well as the commitment made by the U.S. government,
so as to maintain the good momentum of development in Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
Only by dispelling all interference and uproar in Sino-US
relations can statesmen in both countries stand higher and see
farther in dealing with Sino-US relations, as a reformer in
China's Song Dynasty said in a poem: "Unafraid of floating clouds
blocking the view, because you stand at the pinnacle." And only by
grasping the fundamental interests of the people of both countries
and having an overall world situation in mind can a prosperous,
stable and peaceful world be properly brought into the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> NATO Announces Air Exercises in Albania, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO announced Thursday that it
would conduct air exercises as soon as possible in Albania and
Macedonia to demonstrate its ability to project power rapidly into
the region.
</P>
<P>
The air exercises were announced after NATO defense ministers
met for a whole day discussing a range of military options the
Western military alliance could take if Slobodan Milosevic
continued indiscriminate use of force against the civilian
population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers gave the go-ahead to NATO military
authorities to conduct an appropriate air exercise both in Albania
and Macedonia as quickly as possible with the consent of the two
countries and with the aim of demonstrating NATO's capability to
project power rapidly into the region.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers also instructed NATO military authorities
to assess and develop as soon as possible a range of military
options for further consideration and decision by the North
Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the 16-nation
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers council expressed deep concern at the
deteriorating situation in Kosovo and called upon all parties to
avoid actions which prolong the violence.
</P>
<P>
NATO continues to support, the defense ministers stated, a
political solution which brings an end to the violence, provides
an enhanced status for Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and safeguards the human
and civil rights of all inhabitants of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers also decided to accelerate the provision
of advice mandated by NATO foreign ministers who met late last
month on possible support for the United Nations and athe
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitoring
activity and on possible NATO preventive deployment of troops in
Albania and Macedonia, both member countries of NATO's Partnership
for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the day's council meeting said that NATO still
lacks a U.N. Security Council resolution as the legal basis for
its military presence in and around Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from Clinton's China Policy Speech At NGS (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are excerpts from the
speech made by U.S. President Bill Clinton on China policies at
the National Geographic Society on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
As all of you know, I will go to China in two weeks' time. It
will be the first state visit by an American president this
decade. I'm going because I think it's the right thing to do for
our country.
</P>
<P>
Today I want to talk with you about our relationship with China
and how it fits into our broader concerns for the world of the
21st century and our concerns in particular for developments in
Asia. That relationship will, in large measure, help to determine
whether the new century is one of security, peace, and prosperity
for the American people.
</P>
<P>
Let me say that all of you know the dimensions, but I think it
is worth repeating a few of the facts about China. It is already
the most populous nation. It will increase by the size of
America's current population every 20 years. Its vast territory
borders 15 countries. It has one of the fastest-growing economies
on earth. It holds a permanent seat on the National Security
Council of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, it has entered a period of profound
change, emerging from isolation, turning a closed economy into an
engine for growth, increasing cooperation with the rest of the
world, raising the standard of living for hundreds of millions of
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The role China chooses to play in preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction or encouraging it, in combating or
ignoring international crime and drug trafficking, in protecting
or degrading the environment, in tearing down or building up trade
barriers, in respecting or abusing human rights; in resolving
difficult situations in Asia, from the Indian subcontinent to the
Korean peninsula, or aggravating them; the role China chooses to
play will powerfully shape the next century.
</P>
<P>
A stable, open, prosperous China that assumes its
responsibilities for building a more peaceful world is clearly and
profoundly in our interests. On that point, all Americans agree.
But as we all know, there is serious disagreement over how best to
encourage the emergence of that kind of China and how to handle
our differences, especially over human rights, in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain
China because of its undemocratic system and human-rights
violations, and in order to retard its capacity to become
America's next great enemy. Some believe increased commercial
dealings alone will inevitably lead to a more open, more
democratic China.
</P>
<P>
We have chosen a different course that I believe to be both
principled and pragmatic, expanding our areas of cooperation with
China, while dealing forthrightly with our differences. This
policy is supported by our key democratic allies in Asia; Japan,
South Korea, Australia, Thailand and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Announces National Agenda Against Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif announced Thursday that his government will confiscate all
the land given to feudal landlords by the British before the
partition.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling a national agenda against sanctions in a televised
speech Thursday evening, the prime minister said all the 1.2
million acres (about 486,000 hectares) of land to be confiscated
will be re-distributed among landless poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in Pakistan's history that the government
has decided to confiscate land from the landlords.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the various measures envisaged in the national
agenda to counter the economic sanctions imposed by the West after
the country's nuclear tests in late May.
</P>
<P>
"Time has come for us to stand on our own feet. We should end
our dependence on others," Sharif said, appealing to the people to
support the government's decision in the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of any sanctions. We have been facing

</P>
<P>
Pakistan has no other option but to go nuclear to defend
national security after the Indian nuclear tests, he said.

</P>
<P>
The government expenditure will be cut by 50 percent in the
forthcoming budget for the next fiscal year, he said.
</P>
<P>
No foreign visit on public expense can be undertaken by any
government official without special permission from the prime
minister, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
No official function can be held in hotels without the
permission of the prime minister and the chief ministers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the government will launch special
education programs to promote literacy in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Every child will get education in the next five years," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he will move out from the grand Prime
Minister's House to a smaller one to save money.
</P>
<P>
He said all the houses of governors and chief ministers will be
converted into guest houses and all the governmental guest houses
will be sold out to pay the country's foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-chairman Donates 1,000 Yuan to China's Anti-Drug Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Wang Guangying, Vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
donated 1,000 yuan to China's anti-drug campaign here today at the
ongoing national anti-drug exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of the memorial to the anti-drug martyrs in
the exhibition hall, Wang listened to the heroic deeds of the
martyrs and shed tears.
</P>
<P>
He demanded the staff of the exhibition buy a wreath and
present it in honor of the martyrs.
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply moved by the exhibition," said Zou Jiahua,
another vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC, adding
that China should conduct a ``harsh and long-term battle against
drugs."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the publicity of the anti-drug campaign be
further intensified so as to make more ordinary people know about
the danger of drugs.
</P>
<P>
All staff members of the anti-drug division of the Beijing
Municipal Public Security Bureau laid a wreath in front of
the memorial to the anti-drug martyrs this morning, and solemnly
declared that they would continue the unfinished work
of the martyrs and strike hard against drug crimes.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from Clinton's China Policy Speech at NGS (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a reason for this. Seeking to isolate China is
clearly unworkable. Even our friends and allies around the world
do not support us -- or would not support us in that. We would
succeed, instead, in isolating ourselves and our own policy.
</P>
<P>
Most important, choosing isolation over engagement would not
make the world safer; it would make it more dangerous. It would
undermine, rather than strengthen, our efforts to foster stability
in Asia. It will eliminate, not facilitate, cooperation on issues
relating to weapons of mass destruction. It would hinder, not
help, the cause of democracy and human rights in China. It would
set back, not step up, worldwide efforts to protect the
environment. It would cut off, not open up, one of the world's
most important markets. It would encourage the Chinese to turn
inward and to act in opposition to our interests and values.
</P>
<P>
First, think about our interest in a stable Asia, an interest
that China shares. The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan are a
threat to the stability we seek. They risk a terrible outcome. A
miscalculation between two adversaries with large armies would be
bad; a miscalculation between two adversaries with nuclear weapons
could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the world to recognize that both India and
Pakistan have security concerns that are legitimate. But it is
equally important for India and Pakistan to recognize that
developing weapons of mass destruction is the wrong way to define
their greatness, to protect their security, or to advance their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
I believe that we now have a self-defeating, dangerous and
costly course under way. I believe that this course, if
continued, not moderated and ultimately changed, will make both
the people of India and the people of Pakistan poorer, not richer
and less, not more, secure. Resolving this requires us to
cooperate with China.
</P>
<P>
Last week, China chaired a meeting of the permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council to forge a common strategy for moving
India and Pakistan back from the nuclear arms race edge. It has
condemned both countries for conducting nuclear tests. It has
joined us in urging them to conduct no more tests, to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to avoid deploying or testing
missiles, to tone down the rhetoric, to work to resolve their
differences, including over Kashmir, through dialogue. Because of
its history with both countries, China must be a part of any
ultimate resolution of this matter.
</P>
<P>
On the Korean peninsula, China has become a force for peace and
stability, helping us to convince North Korea to freeze its
dangerous nuclear program, playing a constructive role in the
four-party peace talks. And China has been a helpful partner in
international efforts to stabilize the Asian financial crisis. In
resisting the temptation to devalue its currency, China has seen
that its own interests lie in preventing another round of
competitive devaluations that would have severely damaged
prospects for regional recovery. It has also contributed to the
rescue packages for affected economies.
</P>
<P>
Second, stopping the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons is clearly one of our most urgent security challenges. As
a nuclear power with increasingly sophisticated industrial and
technological capabilities, China can choose either to be a part
of the problem or a part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
For years, China stood outside the international arms-control
regimes. In the last decade, it has joined the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the
Biological Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test-Ban
Treaty, each with clear rules, reporting requirements and
inspection systems.
</P>
<P>
In the past, China has been a major exporter of sophisticated
weapons-related technologies. That is why, in virtually all our
high-level contacts with China's leadership and in my summit
meeting with President Jiang last October, nonproliferation has
been high on the agenda. Had we been trying to isolate China
rather than work with it, would China have agreed to stop
assistance to Iran for its nuclear program? to terminate its
assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, such as those in
Pakistan? to tighten its export-control system? to sell no more
anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran? These vital decisions were all
in our interests, and they clearly were the fruit of our
engagement.
</P>
<P>
Third, the United States has a profound stake in combating
international organized crime and drug trafficking. International
criminal syndicates threaten to undermine confidence in new but
fragile market democracies; they bilk people out of billions of
dollars, and bring violence and despair to our schools and
neighborhoods. These are problems from which none of us are
isolated and which, as I said at the United Nations a few days
ago, no nation is so big it can fight alone.
</P>
<P>
With a land mass spanning from Russia in the north to Vietnam
and Thailand in the south, from India and Pakistan in the west, to
Korea and Japan in the east, China has become a trans-shipment
point for drugs and the proceeds of illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a special liaison group that President Jiang and I
established, brought together leading Chinese and American law
enforcement officials to step up our cooperation against organized
crime, alien smuggling and counterfeiting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Students Defy Order to Return to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Students from institutes of higher
learning in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, Thursday
defied a government order to return to classes, and continued
with demonstrations, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Their class boycott is aimed at pressing the government to
reopen the University of Zimbabwe and Harare Polytechnic which
were close last week following demonstrations against corruption
which degenerated into anarchy.
</P>
<P>
President of Zimbabwe National Students Union Hopewell Gumbo
told the news agency, ''we are not going to comply with the
ultimatum. The demonstrations will continue.''
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Deputy Minister of Higher Education and
Technology Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said students should return to
classes Thursday or face unspecified consequences.
</P>
<P>
''If students decide not to attend classes,'' he said, ''the
ministry will assume they are not interested in learning, and the
government will not stand idlely by while the situation
deteriorates.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of students from Masvingo Technical
College and Masvingo Teachers' College in south Zimbabwe Thursday
disrupted traffic during a demonstration to press for the
reopening of two institutions of higher learning closed by the
government in Harare.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Privatization Will Go on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday expressed the government's keenness on carrying on the
privatization process in the interest of the nation, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In statements to reporters after the inauguration of Mubarak
Military Hospital in Arish, the largest city in Northern Sinai,
Mubarak said the steps of privatization are "accurately
calculated."
</P>
<P>
"The state does not take any decision in privatization that
could stand against its interests or make any group to have the
upper hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Privatization is an essential part of Egypt's economic reform
program which started in 1982 when Mubarak took office.
</P>
<P>
Since it launched its privatization program in earnest in 1996,
the government has sold majority stakes in scores of firms,
divested its interest in mobile telephone network and offered
infrastructure and utilities projects to private investors.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is selling 10 companies every three months and 105 out of
314 state-owned companies have been offered for sale under the
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The president said privatization is carried out for the
interests of the nation regardless of any calls by international
institutions to hasten such process.
</P>
<P>
"We did not sell our country. we are even more keen on this
nation than those who claim that," he emphasized, dismissing
"astonishing, ridiculous and false reports" on privatization of
the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's inauguration ceremony was attended by Prime Minister
Kamal al-Ganzouri, Minister of Defense and Military Production
Hussein Tantawi and other high ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from Clinton's China Policy Speech at NGS (Part III) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourth, China and the United States share the same global
environment, an interest in preserving it for this and future
generations. China is experiencing an environmental crisis
perhaps greater than any other nation in history at a comparable
stage of its development.
</P>
<P>
It is a fool's errand to believe that we can deal with our
present and future global environmental challenges without strong
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, I will explore with President Jiang how American
clean energy technology can help to improve air quality and bring
electricity to more of China's rural residents. We will discuss
innovative tools for financing clean energy development that were
established under the Kyoto climate change agreement.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, America clearly benefits from an increasingly free,
fair, and open global trading system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, trade has generated more than
one-third of the remarkable economic growth we have enjoyed. If
we are to continue generating 20 percent of the world's wealth
with just 4 percent of its population, we must continue to trade
with the other 96 percent of the people with whom we share this
small planet.
</P>
<P>
One in every four people is Chinese, and China boasts a growth
rate that has averaged 10 percent for the past 20 years. Over the
next 20 years it is projected that the developing economies will
grow at three times the rate of the already developed
economies. It is manifestly, therefore, in our interest to bring
the Chinese people more and more fully into the global trading
system, to get the benefits and share the responsibilities of
emerging economic prosperity. Already China is one of the fastest
growing markets for our goods and services. As we look into the
next century, it will clearly support hundreds of thousands of
jobs all across our country.
</P>
<P>
We could erect trade barriers. We could deny China the normal
trading status we give to so many other countries with whom we
have significant disagreements. But that would only penalize our
consumers, invite retaliation from China on 13 billion dollars in
United States exports, and create a self-defeating cycle of
protectionism that the world has seen before.
</P>
<P>
China's remarkable economic growth is making China more and
more dependent on other nations for investment, for markets, for
energy, for ideas. These ties increase the need for the stronger
rule of law, openness and accountability, and they carry with them
powerful agents of change; fax machines and photocopiers,
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The licensing of American commercial satellite launches on
Chinese rockets was approved by President Reagan, begun by
President Bush, continued under my administration, for the simple
reason that the demand for American satellites far outstrips
America's launch capacity and because others, including Russian
and European nations, can do this job at much less cost.
</P>
<P>
It is important for every American to understand that there are
strict safeguards, including a Department of Defense plan for each
launch, to prevent any assistance to China's missile programs.
Licensing these launches allows us to meet the demand for American
satellites and helps people on every continent share ideas,
information and images, through television, cell phones and
pagers. In the case of China, the policy also furthers our efforts
to stop the spread of missile technology by providing China
incentives to observe nonproliferation agreements. This policy
clearly has served our national interests.
</P>
<P>
Over time, I believe China's leaders must accept freedom's
progress because China can only reach its full potential if its
people are free to reach theirs. In the Information Age, the
wealth of any nation, including China's, lies in its people; in
their capacity to create, to communicate, to innovate.
</P>
<P>
We do not ignore the value of symbols. But in the end, if the
choice is between making a symbolic point and making a real
difference, I choose to make the difference. And when it comes to
advancing human rights and religious freedom, dealing directly and
speaking honestly to the Chinese is clearly the best way to make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
China has known more millennia than the United States has known
centuries. But for more than 220 years, we have been conducting a
great experiment in democracy
</P>
<P>
China will choose its own destiny. But we can influence that
choice by making the right choice ourselves; working with China
where we can, dealing directly with our differences where we
must. Bringing China into the community of nations, rather than
trying to shut it out, is plainly the best way to advance both our
interests and our values. It is best way to encourage China to
follow the path of stability, openness, nonaggression; to embrace
free markets, political pluralism, the rule of law; to join us in
building a stable international order where free people can make
the most of their lives and give vent to their children's dreams.
</P>
<P>
That kind of China, rather than one turned inward and
confrontational, is profoundly in our interests. That kind of
China can help to shape a 21st century that is the most peaceful
and prosperous era the world has ever known.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Visiting China, Right Thing for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here Thursday that it is the right thing to do for him to
visit China as China has made a lot of progress in various fields
and is playing an important role in world and regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Geographic Society, Clinton said that
over the past 25 years, China has entered a period of profound
change, "emerging from isolation, turning a closed economy into an
engine for growth, increasing cooperation with the rest of the
world, raising the standard of living for hundreds of millions of
its citizens."
</P>
<P>
He said China also has played a major role in safeguarding
peace in the Korean Peninsula and the region of Asia as well as
the world.
</P>
<P>
It was noticeable that China has made a positive role in
stabilizing the Asian financial situation at a time when there is
a crisis there, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that China's role "will powerfully shape
the next century" in preventing the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, in combating international crime and drug
trafficking, in protecting the environment, and in resolving
difficult situations in Asia, from the Indian subcontinent to the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"A stable, open, prosperous China that assumes its
responsibilities for building a more peaceful world is clearly and
profoundly in our interests," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the principle for the United States to be
"expanding our areas of cooperation with China, while dealing
forthrightly with our differences."
</P>
<P>
Referring to some voices for isolating and containing China,
Clinton said, "Seeking to isolate China is clearly unworkable.
Even our friends and allies around the world do not support us --
or would not support us in that. We would succeed, instead, in
isolating ourselves and our own policy."
</P>
<P>
He further elaborated that "choosing isolation over engagement
would not make the world safer; it would make it more dangerous.
It would undermine, rather (than) strengthen, our efforts to
foster stability in Asia. It will eliminate, not facilitate,
cooperation on issues relating to weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
"It would cut off, not open up, one of the world's most
important markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States can work toward China's
admission to the World Trade Organization on commercially
meaningful terms and renew normal trade treatment for China as
every president has done since 1980 and strengthen U.S. economic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"In each of these crucial areas, working with China is the best
way to advance our interests," stressed Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Students Suspended for Boycotting Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,034 students
have vacated the state-run Sokoine University of Agriculture
(SUA) following an official suspension for their boycotting the
annual exams, an official of the administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua on a
telephone interview that peace came back to the campus in
Morogoro, some 200 kilometers west of Dar es Salaam in the
morning and the armed policemen, the well-known Field Force Unit
(FFU), withdrew.
</P>
<P>
The students at various degrees and fields were ordered out of
the SUA, which was founded in 1984 as the second largest
university in Tanzania, following their strike against the final
exams on claims that they were served with the results of their
course work very late, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I announce to all undergraduate students who boycotted
examinations from June 8 until today that you have been suspended
until further notice," a statement by the SUA Vice-Chancellor
Anselm Luoga said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official report said that less than one hundred students
took part in the exams in SUA which accommodate 1,252
undergraduate and postgraduate students majored in farming,
forestry, veterinary medicine, environmental conservation, soil
science and etc.
</P>
<P>
It said that apart from the boycott, there has been several
destructive incidents on the campus where some female students
were beaten for writing the papers and a laboratory was
vandalized since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some parents arrived at the SUA to collect their children and
the FFU personnel came to mount tight security while the SUA
administration met to try to find a way out for ending the
crisis.

BUCHAREST, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Romania's software industry is
one of the first fields having big chances to develop besides
agriculture, tourism and mineral waters, the Romanian national
news agency Rompres reported Thursday.
</P>

Romania exports at the moment software amounting to about 10

Romania as a possible leader of the information technology
market," said Florin Talpes, the General Manager of Softwin
Company.
</P>
<P>
The informatics expert ratio for every thousand inhabitants in
Romania is seven times larger than in India, a world-famous
software exporter. Romania counts 5,000 informatics graduates a
year. This level is five times smaller than that in India, whose
population is 35 times larger, Rompres said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli-allied Militiamen Killed in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli-allied South Lebanese
Army (SLA) members were killed and at least three others wounded
in separate attacks by Lebanese anti-Israeli guerrillas in south
Lebanon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio said a roadside bomb killed an
SLA and injured three others when an SLA patrol passed by in
Jezzine, just north of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon enclave.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed the
responsibility for the attack, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Hours before, another SLA member had been killed in a mortar
attack launched by Hezbollah guerrillas on an SLA post also in
Jezzine. Hezbollah said in a statement that the attack also
wounded others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for Hezbollah's attack, Israeli warplanes staged
a raid on the guerrilla stronghold in the Iqlim Toufah area, near
Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon in alliance with its proxy SLA since 1985 to
allegedly protect its north from Lebanese guerrilla attack. Since
then, Israeli troops have met a strong anti-occupation movement
spearheaded by Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Increase Pensions for Gurkha Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
decided to increase the pensions for former Gurkha soldiers who
served in the British army and their families, the British Embassy
here said in a press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The revised pensions with rises ranging from 23 to 51 percent
depending on rank, years of service and date of retirement will be
distributed from October 1998, the embassy said, adding that the
former Gurkha soldiers can get an increased pension from January
1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
There are 26,375 ex-Gurkhas and their families who are
receiving pensions worth 6.9 million British pounds (about 11
million U.S. dollars) every year from the British government, the
embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Many retired Gurkha soldiers are receiving as little as 24
pounds (38 dollars) per month while their British counterparts are
getting 475 pounds (760 dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the ex-Gurkhas have been demanding
pension parity with their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Their other demands include the right to live and work in
Britain and pensions for those dismissed without pensions.
</P>
<P>
They have been pressing hard for their demands and have even
threatened to file a case at London courts.
</P>
<P>
The British army drafted Nepalese in 1816 under the Sugauli
Treaty signed between Nepal and the East India Company of Britain.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Nepalese soldiers fought during the First and
Second World Wars and 15,000 of them were killed, figures show.
</P>
<P>
Under a tripartite agreement reached in 1947 between Nepal,
India and Britain, the British and Indian armies can recruit
Nepalese, who have been popularly known as Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 2,500 to 3,000 Nepalese are serving in the British
army.

<HEADLINE> NATO Still Needs U.N. Mandate to Act in Kosovo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson hinted Thursday that NATO still needs a United Nations
resolution to go with its planned military presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister told the press that he could not see why
NATO could not get a U.N. Security Council mandate but clarified
that the Western military alliance would not produce any timetable
for itself or for Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that NATO defense ministers were considering
"inevitable use of air power" to rein in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, however, Robertson told reporters that days
and not weeks is the timetable set out for Belgrade to stop its
indiscriminate use of force against the civilian population in
Kosovo or NATO may have to resort to military intervention to help
solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, who asked not to be named, said earlier
Thursday that NATO defense ministers reached consensus on
inevitable military intervention to force Milosevic to stop his
action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
When asked what other military options NATO defense ministers
had considered during the day apart from possible air strikes
against Serbian military facilities in Kosovo, the British defense
secretary said that NATO did not rule in nor ruled out any option.
</P>
<P>
He cited no-fly zone, electronic warfare and humanitarian
manouver as other options discussed by the defense ministers
during their council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Robertson stressed that it would be "rash and foolish for
Milosevic" to slight international calls to refrain from abuse of
force and urged Belgrade to think again and change tactics.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Milosevic's planned trip to Moscow had
anything to do with the announcement of only air exercises instead
of more drastic NATO actions, the British defense minister said
that it would be good for the Russians to be involved in the
peace-making process.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, he said, have been heavily engaged in the process
already.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that what NATO defense ministers meant in their
message is an even-handedness by asking for an end of violence on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there will be the eventual military back-up
for the diplomatic and economic pressure exerted on the parties in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Britain has initiated a draft resolution to work through the
U.N. Security Council.

LUANDA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Mose Tjitendero, Chairman of the
Parliamentary Forum of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), who doubles as Namibian Speaker, said here Thursday that
SADC concerns over the delay of Angola's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Tjitendero made the remarks after meeting the Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos, and said that SADC members
concerned over the fact the the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol is not

the future of the region could not be bright without peace in
Angola.
</P>

The SADC countries urged the parties in Angola to observe the
peace protocol and bring peace to the land and the southern
African region as soon as possible, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Unity to Deal With "Main </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Thursday strongly called for unity of the nation
to deal with the "main enemies" of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei issued the call at a speech to a large crowd during
his inspection tour in Amol, northern province of Mazadaran,
according to the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that unity and following the guidance of Islam and holy
Koran are the two principles for the progressive process of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the call at a time when the Iranian powerful
conservatives launched new offensives against the moderate
government by putting Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi on
open trial and demanding an impeachment of Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary started the trial on Karbaschi
on Sunday, but the accused rejected all charges leveled against
him.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 31 Majlis (parliament) deputies proposed a motion
to impeach Nouri. They said in the motion that "continuation of
Nouri's service at the post of interior minister is detrimental
to tranquillity and stability of the country."
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on Wednesday expressed
welcome to the challenges, saying that the process of impeachment
would help bring about the necessary transparency in the
government's stance.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Nouri has the necessary capability to
elaborate on the stance and issues related to the Interior
Ministry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made no comment on the factional struggles, saying
that the enemies of the Islamic revolution are trying in vain to
make the nation forget the main enemies and sow discord among the
people.
</P>
<P>
He said that an independent and free nation is one that is
capable of standing on its own feet and tread the right path with
unity, adding that the Iranian nation has done so in the past 19
years and has made great achievements.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader reminded the people of the will of the late
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini who called on
the nation to resort to Islam and solidarity and not to neglect
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the enemy does not always penetrate through
geographical borders, sometimes it may infiltrate through the
cultural borders, something which requires more care on the part
of the people to deal with it.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Conduct Air Exercises in Albania, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO announced Thursday that it
would conduct air exercises as soon as possible in Albania and
Macedonia to demonstrate its ability to project power rapidly into
the region.
</P>
<P>
The air exercises were announced after NATO defense ministers
met for a whole day discussing a range of military options the
Western militaly alliance could take if Slobodan Milosevic
continued indiscriminate use of force against the civilian
population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers gave the go-ahead to NATO military
authorities to conduct an appropriate air exercise both in Albania
and Macedonia as quickly as possible, probably within days, with
the aim of demonstrating NATO's capability to project power
rapidly into the region.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said after the defense
ministers council meeting that the alliance had already got the
consent from Albania and Macedonia for the air exercises which are
expected to be held "very soon."
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers also instructed NATO military authorities
to assess and develop as soon as possible a range of military
options for further consideration and decision by the North
Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the 16-nation
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers council expressed deep concern at the
deteriorating situation in Kosovo and called upon all parties to
avoid actions which prolong the violence.
</P>
<P>
NATO continues to support, the defense ministers stated, a
political solution which brings an end to the violence, provides
an enhanced status for Kosovo, preserves the territorial integrity
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and safeguards the human
and civil rights of all inhabitants of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers also decided to accelerate the provision
of advice mandated by NATO foreign ministers who met late last
month on possible support for the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitoring
activity and on possible NATO preventive deployment of troops in
Albania and Macedonia, both member countries of NATO's Partnership
for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
Solana condemned the deteriorating situation in Kosovo and
urged both sides to refrain from violence.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting, the NATO chief said, was to show that the
alliance was ready for action and action plans included possible
use of NATO air power.
</P>
<P>
When asked where is the point to which NATO air strikes will be
triggered, the alliance chief said that how to proceed will have
to depend on the development of the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that NATO would not rule out the possibility of
eventual deployment of ground troops in Kosovo itself.
</P>
<P>
In a separate press briefing, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said that most defense ministers agreed that a U.N. Security
Council or an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
mandate would be desirable but a U.N. mandate is not "imperative."
</P>
<P>
But the American defense chief said that NATO did not want to
send out a wrong signal that it was supporting Kosovo
independence.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Contact Group are to meet Friday
in London to study the development of the situation in Kosovo and
the planned actions by NATO.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Promises to Stay on in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Special Envoy to
Angola, Blondin Beye, said here Thursday that he would stay on in
Angola until final peace is crystalized in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on returning here from his U.N. Security Council
meeting on Angola, Beye said that peace here needs a mediator,
but whether his mission could be completed hinges on the
resumption of trust by both sides of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Beye said he would continue his southern African tour to
solicit support for the peace effort, so as to end the four-year
long peace process in Angola as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Angola is experiencing a critical period
as militiamen of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) are still carrying out sabotage activities in
parts of the country, and the UNITA leaders refuse to hand out
the four sensitive areas to the government.

BORDEAUX, France, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy tied with Chile 2-2 in
their Group B opener in the soccer World Cup finals here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Christian Vieri put Italy ahead in the 10th minute, blasting the

</P>
<P>
Chile equalized in the last minute of the first half when striker

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Announces Measures Against Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday unveiled a package of austerity measures to
counter the economic sanctions imposed by the West against the
country for its nuclear tests following those of India last month.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation Thursday evening, Sharif
said he was presenting before the nation a portion of his agenda
of self-reliance, development and nation-building and change.
</P>
<P>
In reality, it is a sweeping agenda under which he wants to
bring about revolutionary changes in social, economic, judicial,
administrative, political fields and in fact in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Reminding the nation that the country's present system has
become obsolete and outdated, the prime minister called for basic
changes in this system.
</P>
<P>
"Time has come for us to stand on our own feet. We should end
our dependence on others," Sharif said, appealing to the people to
support the government's decision in the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of any sanctions. We have been facing
sanctions for over 10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has no other option but to go nuclear to defend
national security after the Indian nuclear tests, he said, adding,
"It is not an easy decision."
</P>
<P>
Unfolding the wide-ranging national agenda, the prime minister
said top priority will be given to the development of the
agricultural sector and full implementation of two previous land
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Under the agenda, 1.2 million acres (486,000 hectares) of land
illegally occupied and saved from the land reforms will be
retrieved for distribution among landless poor farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The measure also covers lands granted by British colonial
rulers to feudal landlords for their loyalty to the rulers and
treachery with the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said such lands have already been identified and he has
directed the federal and provincial governments to take over the
possession of such lands for immediate distribution.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in Pakistan's history that the government
has decided to confiscate land from the landlords.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has imposed a ban on the purchase of
everything for official and semi-official departments and the
government will not buy any new car, furniture, air conditioner
and other things.
</P>
<P>
The government expenditure will be cut by 50 percent in the
forthcoming budget for the next fiscal year, he said.
</P>
<P>
All the cabinet ministers will not draw their salaries in the
coming months and all the parliamentarians agreed to cut their pay
and allowances, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
No foreign visit on public expense can be undertaken by any
government official without special permission from the prime
minister, he said. And no official function can be held in hotels
without permission of the prime minister and the chief ministers.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he will move out of the grand Prime
Minister's house to save money and all the houses of governors and
chief ministers will be converted into guest houses and all the
governmental guest houses will be sold out to pay the country's
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
He said his family have decided to pay back their loans and for
this purpose they are handing over their assets to banks to
recover the loaned amount by selling them.
</P>
<P>
He gave a strong warning to tax evaders and those involved in
gas and electricity theft, saying their place would be the jail.
</P>
<P>
He gave a four-week period to loan defaulters to settle their
accounts with banks and after the period, the government will take
measures to recover these loans and in future no one would dare to
pocket loans obtained for business.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he also announced that the government will launch
special education programs to promote literacy in the country.
"Every child will get education in the next five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister's national agenda was announced
two weeks after the country was provoked by neighboring rival
India to have detonated its own nuclear devices, triggering strong
condemnations and severe economic sanctions from Western countries
including the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the economy of Pakistan, which has just 1.2
billion U.S. dollars of foreign exchange reserves, will be hit
particularly hard by the sanctions as its depressed economy is too
dependent on foreign aid and loans.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to deal with the post-nuclear blast sanctions, the
Pakistani government has already imposed a six-month state of
emergency in the country.

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports Peace Efforts Toward Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy Thursday expressed his country's support for finding a
solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after his meeting here with his Cypriot
counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides, during which they discussed the
latest development of the Cyprus problem and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy, who arrived here Wednesday night for a one-day
visit, pointed out, however, that Canada does not have a specific
role as a broker or any particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to underline the importance of finding a way of
engaging in a dialog and developing a serious examination of the
issues," the Canadian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern part of the island in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process has remained deadlocked since last
summer when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of a
U.N.-sponsored peace talks with President Glafcos Clerides in
protest against the European Union (EU) decision to open accession
talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has refused to attend the intercommunal talks unless
his breakaway entity in northern Cyprus is recognized and Cyprus
suspends its accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on President Clerides' proposal for the
island's demilitarization, Axworthy told reporters that
"certainly I think that would be a major step forward to
demilitarize and download the confrontation areas."
</P>
<P>
He said he also discussed the issue during a meeting Thursday
in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia with
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a form of guarantee of security because of
the past history which perhaps the international community can
provide," he added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides described his meeting with Axworthy as
"productive and interesting" and expressed appreciation for the
Canadian minister interest in Cyprus, its problem and efforts
toward its resolution.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Set Tight Budget: Nyachae </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae presented Thursday to parliament the 1998/99 budget aimed
at reviving the country's battled economy but also sending a
signal of an belt-tightening area.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the fiscal year of 1998/99 (July 1/June 30) is
focusing on cutting public spending especially on civil servants
wages and raising taxes with a view to curbing domestic debt,
interest rates, and finally the mounting budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
"The 1998/99 budget... reflects two principles that can be
summarized in a few words -- fiscal restraint and a balanced
budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking all of you to tighten your belts so that we can
achieve a balanced budget this year and thereafter achieve
surpluses," Nyachae said.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the east African country fell from 4.6
percent in 1996 to 2.3 percent last year. Analysts say the
darkest shadow brooding over the economy is that of the national
debt estimated currently at 160 billion Shillings (2.67 billion
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nyachae also vowed in the draft budget to speed up
privatization, enforce the tax system, cut governmental borrowing
requirements by at least five percent, improve infrastructure
especially roads and keep inflation within the single digit
level.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to fight corruption and tax evasion will be
intensified," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, "expenditure will bear most of the required
adjustments," he announced, targeting that "a total expenditure
of 12,087.1 million Shillings (2 billion Dollars) will have to be
financed in 1998/99 fiscal year."
</P>
<P>
"The combined public sector wage bill, assuming civil servants
are given similar increment, would absorb 67 percent of total
revenue," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He asked for an additional reduction of 59,000 civil servants
over the next three years and renegotiating the Teachers Pay
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It will be necessary to freeze pay adjustments in 1998/99 for
all categories of public service, except for normal annual grade
increment of about four percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he proposed a series of taxation proposals with a
target that "ordinary revenues, mainly from taxes, will be
maintained at or below 24 percent of GDP."
</P>
<P>
The measures include raising the penalty of uncustomed goods,
raising the duty rate on a selected range of processed
agricultural produce and their substitutes, and strengthening the
fight against goods dumping on local markets.
</P>
<P>
The budget is announced after Kenya's tourism earnings is down
and the country has been hard hit by the El Nino weather pattern,
resulting in the decrease in agricultural output.

<HEADLINE> Baggio Saves Italy With Late Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BORDEAUX, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Roberto Boggio, who entered the
World Cup finals at the last minutes, pulled Italy back from the
brink of defeat with a penalty kick late in the match against Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team, who was trademarked with slow warm-up in major
international tournaments, were badly off form in the opening match
of Group B which also includes Cameroon and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean team, led by deadly duo Ivan Zamorano and Marcelo
Salas, showed that they were the better prepared team in the first
20 minutes of the match.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean team took control of the midfield with smooth
combinations while the Italian team appeared sluggish.
</P>
<P>
But it was the Italians who opened the scoring. Captain Paolo
Maldini launched a quick counter-attack with an accurate long-range
pass and Christian Vieri beat the Chilean goal-keeper Tapia with a
left-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
The Italians played a little bit better in the remaining time of
the first half. But the Chilean team came back into the match and
forced a corner in the injury time. Salas slamed home a rebound to
level the score 1-1.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Chileans played a more aggressive and
effective game with their quick and accurate pass. Salas scored
again on a head pass from Zamorano.
</P>
<P>
The Chileans seemed very likely to win the match as the match
approaching to its end. But Baggio saved the Italian team as his
pass hit the hand of Chilean defender Ronald Fuentes at the 84th
minute. The Nigerian refree Lucien Bouchardear awarded the penalty
kick to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Baggio, who missed a penalty shot four years ago in the final of
the World Cup in the United States, scored from the spot with a low
right-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team missed their ace striker Alessandro Del Piero
who is still not one hundred percent fit.
</P>
<P>
Later on Thursday, Cameroon and Austria will play the other
Group B match at Toulouse.

<HEADLINE> Mortality Rates of Iraqi Children, Elderly Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Death toll among children under
five years and elderly people over 50 is still heavy, according
to the latest statistics released by Iraqi health ministry.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that in May, 4,897 deaths were recorded
among children under five years old, of whom nearly 2,000 died of
malnutrition, compared to 347 infant deaths in May 1989 before the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As for the elderly people aged over fifty, the statistics show
that 2,443 death cases over the same period were registered, of
which 706 caused by hypertension, 307 by diabetes and 1,430 by
cancer. In May 1989, only 533 death cases were recorded.
</P>
<P>
The ministry put the blame on sanctions-spawned dearth in
food, medicine and other essentials of life.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive sanctions were imposed by the United Nations
in 1990 to punish Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. They can only be
lifted when U.N. inspectors verify that the country is free of
weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia claimed that
Eritrean aircraft attacked civilian targets at Adigrat Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by the Office of the Ethiopian

used to bomb civilian targets at Adigrat, 35 kilometers south of
the Ethio-Eritrean border, "killing women and children."
</P>

The news release said, "Thursday afternoon after being heavily
defeated militarily on two fronts, Eritrea attacked Adigrat from
the air."
</P>
<P>
"Casualty figures are not yet available but will be announced
soon," it said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down due to Monetary Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Romania's economy is still
unfunctional and price increases are avoided although the
inflation rate is down thanks to restrictive money policies
pursued by the National Bank, said economic analysts here.
</P>
<P>
The National Board on Statistics recently said the inflation
rate was 2.3 percent in May, lower than that in the previous
month. "May inflation figures came as no surprise in view of the
concerted policies of the National Bank and the Finance Ministry
aimed at keeping price increases at bay by sucking up the national
currency lei from the market and issuing T-bond for individual
savers," said economic analyst Ilie Serbanescu, former minister of
reform.
</P>
<P>
"Taking the figures as a yardstick, Romania is sitting pretty,
yet what is worrying is that the decrease in the inflation rate is
a mere facade and was caused by a falling consumption rate and
lower profit margins for the commercial companies," said Gabriela
Sendroiu, analyzing director for Romania of the Austrian
Creditanstalt group.
</P>
<P>
The government has projected a 2 percent monthly inflation rate
for the next period, which Serbanescu believes is realistic for
the summer months only. He said, "The problem is that more dangers
will add up in autumn: the skid of wage benefits if the
government gives way under social pressure; the recoupling of
money economy with real economy after the National Bank gave up
its policy of attracting deposits from commercial banks and thus
obliged them to use their liquidities to relaunch credit
operations."
</P>
<P>
"To ease inflation is the priority of the National Bank.
Romania will be lost if it does not win the war against
inflation," stressed Adrian Vasilescu, director of the bank's
Communication Department. "Some say that Romania should play an
inflation game. I reply that their theories come from old books
and do not apply to our times. Presently, the global economy
operates in an environment of low inflation. Keeping Romania on an
inflationary peak will prove catastrophic. If our policies were
changed right now, we would be taking too great a risk," Vasilescu
said.

<HEADLINE> Jacquet to Be More Cautious Against South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MARSEILLE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- French coach Aime Jacquet will be
more cautious in the match against South Africa which will be played
in the soccer-mad city Marseille on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After two months of working with a three-man defence and an
attacking midfield, Jacquet is set to revert to four defenders at
the back while at the same time field two defensive midfielders.
</P>
<P>
"The result before all, then it comes down to content," said
Jacquet, who predict that all the first-round matches would be close
and stressful.
</P>
<P>
French play-maker Zinedine Zidane agreed with his coach:"The
important thing is to win."
</P>
<P>
Jacquet's revision of tactics means that full-backs Bixente
Lizarazu and Lilian Thuram will be told to refrain from their
attacking instincts.
</P>
<P>
French can expect a tough challenge from the South African team
who announced earlier that they would play a physical game against
the French team.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government and the European Investment
Bank (EIB) Thursday signed two agreements, under which the EIB
will provide the kingdom with loans of 83 million ECU (about 91.3
million U.S. dollars) to fund water and potash production projects
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Forty million ECU (44 million dollars) will be used to finance
the restructuring and rehabilitating of the drinking water
distribution network in Amman, Jordan's official news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The rest is to finance the expansion project of the Arab Potash
Company to help it increase production capacity from 1.8 million
tonnes of potash per year to 2.11 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The oil price slump caused 6.8 billion U.S. dollars of
economic losses to the Arab Gulf countries in the first quarter of
this year, Arab economists said in a report published by
Thursday's Al-Alam Al-Youm newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The oil price went down by six U.S. dollars per barrel during
that period.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A 250 million-dollar financing contract was signed
in Dubai Thursday between the United Arab Navigation Company on
one side and the International Gulf Bank, the Arab Banking
Establishment and the National Bank of Kuwait on the other.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) news agency, the
loan will be used to cover part of the 660 million-dollar contract
between the company and a Japanese ship-building group to build
ten new ships for the company.
</P>
<P>
Each of the ships will have a capacity of carrying 3,800
standard containers with a speed of 24 knots.
</P>
<P>
The remaining cost, namely, 410 million dollars, will be self
financed by the company. By signing this contract, the company
aims to enhance and develop operation services.
</P>
<P>
The company, owned by some Arab states including the UAE,
currently owns and operates 51 ships. The company services cover
most world trade to the Gulf and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Petroleum Cooperation Committee of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states will meet next Tuesday in
Riyadh to assess and support the Amsterdam oil accord,
well-informed petroleum sources announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the meeting is aimed at making a
comprehensive assessment of the agreement reached by Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico on June 4 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on
cutting their oil production by 450,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf countries will support and back this accord at the
forthcoming conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) due to take place on June 24 in Vienna, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also consider at its one-day meeting
regional cooperation among the GCC states in petroleum industry,
and coordination of their stances regarding developments in the
world oil markets.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.S. Right Ring's Cold War Rhetoric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- As President Bill Clinton is
preparing his visit to China later this month, right-ring
politicians in Congress are gathering things to create a "Chinese
plot" and whipping up a new China scare.
</P>
<P>
Among the sins being blamed on China are campaign
contributions, exploding satellite missiles, and the lease of a
shipping terminal in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
But as a Chinese philosophical concept goes, things turn into
their opposites when they reach the extreme. The "Chinese plot"
seems untrue to knowledgeable people, who also become skeptical of
the politicians' intentions of making a big deal out of nothing.
</P>
<P>
Columnist Robert Scheer called GOP's China card a "red joker."
In an article on Los Angeles Times Tuesday, he said that "on the
question of missiles, congressional partisans whip up a bogus
storm over a nonissue."
</P>
<P>
"There's no Clinton administration culpability or threat to
national security, despite lurid claims by Republicans," said
Scheer, citing an article written jointly by George Bush's
national security advisor Brent Scowcroft and undersecretary of
state Arnold R. Kanter. The two former officials said that the
Chinese government never requested information or other assistance
from the U.S. government to improve the space boosters they use to
launch satellites.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese do not need U.S. expertise to be able to hit an
American city with a nuclear-armed missile," Scheer wrote. "They
were already quite expert at rock technology back in 1988, when
Ronald Reagan authorized the launching of made-in-America
satellites atop Chinese rockets."
</P>
<P>
In all, he said, there was no Chinese plot to get the Clinton
administration to help Beijing with its rockets. In fact, "the
attempt by Republicans to make a big deal out of military
technology transfers to China is pathetically partisan and wholly
bogus. It represents a desperate recycling of Cold War rhetoric
that riles old fears but denies the new world reality."
</P>
<P>
This Cold War concept was shared by Ames O. Goldborough, who
wrote an article on San Diego Union Tribune on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing all the things conservatives in Congress used to blame
on China, Goldborough said that "ninety percent of this feigned
hysteria about China is political and the rest is the right wing's
frustration over America's lack of enemies."
</P>
<P>
The author made his point with the Long Beach-China Ocean
Shipping Company (COSCO) affair. When the Navy recently vacated
its base and shipyard in Long Beach, Southern California, the Port
of Long Beach decided to turn them into a cargo terminal. And part
of the new terminal would be leased to COSCO. But some House
conservatives decided the nation could not have Communists at a
former Navy base, although such officials as the defense
secretary, the navy secretary and the national security adviser
all assured them that COSCO, which operates in 36 U.S. ports, was
no threat to America's national security.
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to give up the Cold War when you've had it all your
life," said Goldrorough, as if there is nothing he could do about
it.
</P>
<P>
But he is sure that "despite our differences, the United States
and China can create friendly and cooperative post-Cold War
relations, as we are doing" and that "we shouldn't allow it to be
undermined by a handful of partisan politicians and Sinophobes
nostalgic for the Cold War."
</P>
<P>
Said Scheer in his article: "The Cold War is over and those who
now attempt to use fear of China to smear Clinton are lost in
time."

<HEADLINE> Malawi Can Benefit From Mozambican Corridors: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Malawi can greatly benefit from
using the economic potential of Mozambvique's Nacala and Sena
Development Corridors, a visiting Mozambican official told the
Malawi News Agency MANA Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's Beira Vorridor's Project Manager, Samuel Geza
said in Malawi's capital Lilongwe Thursday that the two corridors
would among other benefits "offer Malawi a vital transport leeway
taking into account Malawi is a land-locked country."
</P>
<P>
Malawi has for long relied on Mozambican port facilities of
Beira, Nacala and Maputo for her external trade, MANA reported in
a dispatch sent to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
However, reliance on the ports was further dealt a severe blow
when movement on the rail lines linking the two friendly nations
was halted by the historical 16-year Mozambican civil war that
had devastated much of the lines.
</P>
<P>
The rail lines have since been reopened.
</P>
<P>
Geza feels Malawi should as well, take advantage of the Nacala
and Sena development corridors' partially tapped potential in the
areas of tourism, mineral resource development, infrastructure
development and manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
The corridors, if fully utilized, said the Mozambican
official, could create employment opportunities for both
countries currently facing high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Geza is in Malawi as part of the delegation of investors from
the "special development initiative group" based in South Africa,
making a follow-up to Malawi's President Bakill Muluzi's visit to
South Africa last week that was also meant to discuss business
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Inspector Urges Iraq's Continued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, executive chairman
of the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM,
said Thursday he hoped Iraq would continue to cooperate in getting
the UNSCOM's "small remaining job" done.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who arrived here Thursday, said at a press conference
that he would meet with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
this weekend to discuss what Iraq should do to show it has met all
the requirements under the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we will be able to agree in our forthcoming talks
on the steps we can take together that will enable me to enter
that report (October report), saying Iraq has taken all the
actions that are required of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said if Iraq provides all information and materials that the
UNSCOM needs, his bi-annual report due to be presented to the
Security Council in October would be "very different from many
previous reports."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibility of conducting new visits to
Iraq's presidential sites, the chairman replied that the UNSCOM
has no such plans at the present time.
</P>
<P>
On the so-called road map the UNSCOM has drawn for Iraq, Butler
said "every item on the list of road map is well known to Iraq,
the materials involved we believe do exist. It is a clarifying
list, it is very concrete, it is the remaining things that are
needed to be done."
</P>
<P>
"I think both sides want to get it done. We have not come to
impose some lists on Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Iraq has not given adequate information to the
UNSCOM with respect to its biological program, adding Baghdad had
provided clearer account on its missile and chemical programs.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the long time that the UNSCOM spent on
disarmament in Iraq to several reasons, including Iraq's earlier
attempt to conceal the existence of biological weapons and the
difficulties the UNSCOM is facing to complete its disarmament job.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a big job remains for the UNSCOM to do, which
is to take some time. "What remains now is relatively small. With
Iraq's full cooperation, we can get this relatively small
remaining job done, I hope in a very short time, and the so-call
road map lists those things that we need to do to get that job
done," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief inspector noted that Iraq has promised
cooperation to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and had kept the
promise in every respect so far. He expressed hope that Iraq would
continue to be cooperative.
</P>
<P>
"I earnestly hope they keep it in this respect on this
weekend, and if they do, they will find we are absolutely
cooperative and competent to verify what they have shown us or
given us, and we'll get the job over very quickly," said Butler.

<HEADLINE> Israel Creates Civilian Guards for Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army ordered Thursday to
set up a force of civilian guards to protect Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, an army statement announced.
</P>
<P>
Under an order signed by Uzi Dayan, commander of Israeli Army's
Central Command, the civilian guards will be operational within
the next few weeks, first at some large settlements such as Ma'ale
Adumin, Ariel and Givat Ze'ev, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ale Adumin is situated by the road linking Jerusalem and the
West Bank city Jericho, Ariel located between Ramallah and Nablus,
and Givat Ze'ev between Ramallah and Jerusalem. They are the three
largest settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although the army did not give the reasons for setting up such
forces, it is believed that this step is aimed at strengthening
the settlements and allay security concerns by the settlers.
</P>
<P>
Since its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
1967 Mideast War, Israel has created over 190 Jewish settlements
in the Palestinian territories, of which 173 are scattered across
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The total population of Jewish settlers stands at around
150,000 and this figure does not include those settlers living in
the Arab East Jerusalem, which has also been occupied by Israel
since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements is one of the outstanding obstacles that
block the progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, that
has been halted since Israeli construction of the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government's move to create the civilian guards forces
also came amid reports that Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority are close to reaching an agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
If Israel accepts the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback,
about 18 Jewish settlements in the West Bank are likely to be
turned into isolated islands surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
areas. Citing their security concerns, the settlers have been
lobbying rightwing members of the government to disrupt any
agreement on further redeployment.

<HEADLINE> UK Scheme to Infiltrate Industry, Win in World Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A new scheme which aims to place
young overseas professionals with UK companies was jointly
launched here Thursday by the Department of Trade and Industry and
the British Council.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the British Overseas Industrial Placement (BOND)
scheme is that these young overseas professionals will return to
their own country and give contracts and opportunities to their UK
host company.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme, in the first year, it will focus on
the key sectors of oil, gas and petrochemicals, healthcare, power
generation, telecoms, environmental services, construction and
food &AMP; drink.
</P>
<P>
Initially it will concentrate on the following countries:
China, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Vietnam, Argentina, Brazil,
the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Egypt and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of the scheme, Minister for Trade
Lord Clinton Davis said, "Providing overseas professionals with
knowledge of, and contracts in, the UK has clear long-term
commercial benefits for Britain."
</P>
<P>
"Equally there can also be clear long term benefits for British
business. The placements will help to establish lasting
relations," he added.

Annan Thursday welcomed the announcement by Pakistan on a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement of Pakistan Thursday declared a

</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief noted with satisfaction that together with the
statement by India to refrain from conducting nuclear testing, a
de facto moratorium on nuclear testing is established in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general expressed the hope that India and
Pakistan will now also take necessary steps to join the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
India conducted nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, which where
followed by Pakistan's nuclear tests on May 28 and 30. The
international community condemned the nuclear tests by the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is to visit Italy on Friday to discuss with Italian leaders the
latest efforts in reviving the deadlocked peace process with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat will discuss with the Italian leaders the ways
of getting the peace process out of its dangerous impasse and he
will also meet with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican to discuss
with him the Israeli violations of Palestinian holy sites," an
official close to Arafat told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Italy, Arafat will also be presented with a
prize for his efforts to bring about peace in the region, the
official said on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He added that a joint Palestinian-Italian ministerial committee
will meet in Rome to discuss arrangements for the Bethlehem 2000
celebrations, during which millions of Christian pilgrims are
expected to visit the holy site of Jesus' birth.
</P>
<P>
The official also confirmed that Arafat postponed his scheduled
visit to Egypt on Thursday due to "technical reasons."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening before his departure for Rome, Arafat will
chair the weekly meeting of the Palestinian leadership in Gaza to
discuss the crisis of the peace process, the Israeli government's
evasion of the signed agreements and its increasing settlement
activities on Palestinian lands.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hails Russia's Position on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday expressed welcome
to Russia's position on the protracted Cyprus problem that the
current impasse on the island has nothing to do with the
Cyprus-Russia missile contract.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed Wednesday that
"we are convinced that the reason for the deadlock in efforts for
a solution to the Cyprus problem is not the contract for the S-300
(missiles) but the maintenance of the unacceptable status quo on
the island."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to foreign press reports on the
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Cyprus has the undeniable sovereign right to
have the exclusive responsibility for its own defenses, since it
is a victim of international law violations due to the Turkish
invasion and occupation of a part of its territory," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statements, Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides described them as "a correct position," a
view that Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides had also expressed.
</P>
<P>
The statements "reaffirm the solid position of the Cypriot
government that the issue of its defense is an exclusive right of
the Republic of Cyprus, something it exercises on a daily basis
because of the maintenance of the unacceptable status quo,"
Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides reiterated that the Cypriot government will only
cancel the deployment of S-300 defense system if considerable
progress is made toward a comprehensive Cyprus settlement or an
agreement for the island's demilitarization is reached.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered S-300 surface-to-air missiles
from Russia in January 1997. They are expected to be delivered in
mid-August this year.
</P>
<P>
The deal was opposed by countries including the U.S. and
Britain, while Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if
they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the threats made by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash Wednesday, Stylianides said the Cypriot government "does
not accept any blackmail from Rauf Denktash."
</P>
<P>
Denktash told journalists in Istanbul, Turkey Wednesday that
"we will announce that the Cyprus problem is closed and invite
Turkey to fully establish itself in the northern part of the
island" if Russian missiles are delivered.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that the Cypriot government will exercise its
foreign policy for the benefit of all Cypriots, reiterating that
Denktash's threats "will in no way affect the Cyprus Republic's
sovereign rights."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Uganda: New Budget Presented to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Finance Minister Gerald
Ssendaula presented the budget for 1998/1999 fiscal year to
parliament Thursday afternoon, with emphasis on security,
education, roads, poverty eradication and pay reforms.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech delivered at the Conference Center in
Nile Hotel, Ssendaula said that the new budget is aimed at
promoting rapid economic growth targeted at seven percent real
gross domestic product growth and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget, spendings for the five priority
sectors will be increased at different rates.
</P>
<P>
Education spending will increase 49 percent to 253 billion
Uganda Shillings (253 million U.S. Dollars), the highest increase
rate among the five sectors, closely followed by security with
164 billion Shillings (164 million Dollars), an increase of 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that education has been neglected
over the past few years. The new budget will enable the number
of primary school teachers to be increased by 20,000 from the
level in 1997 when free primary education was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in the northern and western regions,
which have been plagued by brutal rebel attacks on civilians,
necessitates a one-off increase in defense spending of 26
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The budget is also characterized by a 4-million-U.S.-Dollar
increase for road construction and a five percent pay increase
for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the budget, the minister said that emphasis is
put on some areas instead of touching each sector as they had
done before.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the development and recurrent
expenditures will remain at the previous level in the coming
fiscal year which begins from July.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Suspends Arms Deal With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has suspended an arms deal
worth 145 million U.S. dollars with France under the impact of the
recent political tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Necati Utkan said a meeting between
the defense industries of the two countries could not be held on
Turkey's purchase of Eryx antitank missiles from France's
Aerospatial due to the negative process witnessed in the
Franco-Turkish ties.
</P>
<P>
This was just one of the deals Turkey reportedly put on hold
because of the political tension triggered by a French
parliamentary bill approved on May 30 to recognize historical
claims of an Armenian genocide in 1915 by Turks.
</P>
<P>
On June 4, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel sent a letter to
his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, asking him to use his power
to correct French legislature's decision on the alleged Armenian
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has denied that the deaths of some 1.5 million
Armenians in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1923 constituted a
genocide, insisting that massacres occurred on both sides as the
result of a civil war.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Economic Growth Expected at 3.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DODOMA, Tanzania, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's economic
growth rate in the 1997-98 fiscal year is expected to arrive at
3.5 percent, below the target of 4.5 percent, Finance Minister
Daniel Yona said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the budget session of parliament in the new capital
of Dodoma in central Tanzania, Yona said the growth rate leaves
much to be desired, particularly when compared with an annual
population growth rate of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the real increase in per capita income of
Tanzanians is less than one percent," he told members of
parliament and foreign envoys at the two-month session which
began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister also predicted that the country's revenue
collection for the whole year from July 1, 1997 to the end of
this month will reach 627,500 million Tanzanian Shillings (about
946 million U.S. Dollars), about 10 percent below the target of
678,000 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The slower economic growth and lack of revenue collection were
mainly attributed to the El Nino-charged heavy rains which have
destroyed key cash crops and severely damaged much of Tanzania's
transport infrastructures, causing long delays in moving exports
and imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for spendings, Yona said the total expenditures for the
year is likely to reach 866,951 million Shillings, 11 percent
less than the budget estimates consistent with resource
availability.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the developments in financial sector, he said the
Bank of Tanzania has effectively managed to control money supply
and inflation by using market-oriented policies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the inflation rate, which reached 13.5 percent
by the end of April, is expected to fall to 10 percent by the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget plans for the 1998-99 fiscal year, Yona
said the government plans to collect 695,165.9 million Shillings
from its domestic sources and spend 1,007,786 million Shillings.
The government will cover the budget deficit from domestic
sources, external assistance and various revenue measures.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the budget frame for the year
1998-99 has been prepared with a view to achieving a gross
domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3.5 percent and keeping
down inflation rate to 7.5 percent by the end of June, 1999.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A plane loaded with 1 million
U.S. dollars worth of aid from the Catholic Church took off from
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and flew directly to Cuba in nearly two
years.
</P>
<P>
The flight, which will ship medical facilities, food and other
humanitarian aid directly to Cuba, is the first since the Clinton
administration eased restrictions on flights in March.
</P>
<P>
The aid was to be delivered to the Cuban Catholic Church's
charity arm Caritas Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Washington suspended direct flights for Cuba after Cuban air
force jets shot down two Cuban exile planes in the Florida Straits
in February 1996, killing four people.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration also allowed Cubans in the U.S. to
post cash to their relatives in Cuba and approved faster
procedures for medical sales. The measures marked changes in the
36-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Offers Assistance to Solve Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem has offered assistance to solve the Kosovo issue in a letter
sent to his British counterpart Robin Cook, a government spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Necati Utkan said at a
weekly press briefing here that Cem briefed Cook on the results of
the meeting of the Balkan Foreign Ministers, held on June 8-9 in
Turkish largest city Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Cem offered Turkish assistance to Cook, who will
host the Contact Group meeting in London on Friday, on solving the
Kosovo conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Turkey's position in case of the intervention
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which Turkey is a
member, Utkan said that "Turkey would bring its own contributions
within the ideas in NATO in case of such an intervention."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question if Turkey would impose political
sanctions on Yugoslavia like some other countries, the spokesman
declined a direct answer, saying the measures that each country
would take will be different.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement issued Thursday said that
Turkey hopes that closer contact will be established between the
regional countries and the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"To this end, we have expressed our wish to establish a
mechanism that would provide a powerful flow of information," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue has been worsening since last February when
bloody clashes erupted between Serbian police and ethnic
Albanians who demand independence from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Reduce Duty Rates on Fuel, Drinks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has decided to reduce the
duty rates on fuel as well as drinks to boost sales of these
products in the country, Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ssendaula said this in his new budget speech to members of
parliament Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to his budget speech, fuel duty rate will be reduced
by 30 Uganda Shillings per liter for petrol and household
kerosene while that for diesel will drop by 60 Shillings per
liter.
</P>
<P>
"Tax reductions will benefit consumers," Ssendaula said. "I
have decided to make further modest reductions in the excise duty
rates for beer and sodas."
</P>
<P>
"For beer, the excise rate is being reduced from 65 percent to
60 percent and for soft drinks, the reduction is from 30 percent
to 25 percent," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The basis for making these reductions is that higher sales
will also produce bigger revenues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ssendaula said that the measures will take effect from the
midnight. At present, about 1,150 Uganda Shillings equal to one
U.S. Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Finland Supports U.N. Efforts for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Finland supports U.N. efforts in
reaching a peaceful Cyprus solution and the island's course for
European Union (EU) accession, a Finnish envoy said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jaakko Blomberg, special representative of Finland for Cyprus,
was speaking to reporters following a meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit here is aimed at preparing for Finland's turn
of EU six-month rotating presidency due to start on July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"For Finland, the question of Cyprus has two basic meanings,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
These, he explained, are the U.N. framework for a peaceful
Cyprus settlement and the EU context for Cyprus' accession
process, both of which Finland is supporting.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that the two courses "affect each other." If
a settlement is not reached before the accession, the EU "will
then have to decide its position with the view to the accession of
Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blomberg pointed out that a solution under the U.N. aegis
would facilitate the accession of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish envoy also expressed the hope that U.N.-led Cyprus
peace talks will soon be resumed and the Turkish Cypriot community
will finally be represented in the accession negotiations, which
Cyprus started in March with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process came to a standstill last summer when
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of a
U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations with Greek Cypriot leader,
President Glafcos Clerides, in protest against an EU decision to
open accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he would not return to the negotiating table
unless his breakaway entity in northern Cyprus controlled by the
Turkish Cypriots is recognized and the Cypriot government
suspends accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed its troops and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Votes on Campaign Finance Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Acting on the first of many
votes on highly controversial campaign finance legislation, the
U.S. House of Representatives Thursday rejected a proposed
constitutional amendment that would have given Congress and the
states power to restrict campaign spending and contributions.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 345-29 against the proposal, which required a
two-thirds majority vote for passage. Fifty-one Democrats voted
"present," but took no position on the measure.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a Republican, who voted against
the proposal, said he offered it for a vote to show that pending
proposals would actually limit Americans' right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
Such an amendment, he argued, would be needed to enact any of
the 11 reform proposals awaiting consideration because the Supreme
Court has equated spending with political speech.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of reform criticized opponents of distorting the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Every time the anti-reformers say `free speech,' they really
mean big money," said Rep. Tom Allen, a Democrat and sponsor of a
popular reform bill drafted by freshman class members.
</P>
<P>
Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat, said Delay was "for
free speech as long as it is expensive."
</P>
<P>
House Democrats' leader Dick Gephardt, who has accused
Republicans of delaying campaign finance legislation, urged
Democrats to withhold support for the amendment and to vote for a
leading reform bill sponsored by Representatives Christopher
Shays, a Republican, and Marty Meehan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which would ban so-called "soft money," -- the
unregulated donations to national and state political parties from
corporations, labor unions and individuals, and regulate issue
advertising by third parties and expand disclosure requirements,
will be debated at a later date. The bill, which is supported by
U.S. President Bill Clinton, is similar to reform legislation that
died in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
The competing proposal by first-term members would "ban soft"
money only at the federal level, increase contribution limits and
require additional disclosure by outside groups.
</P>
<P>
Debate on campaign finance reform is expected to drag on for
weeks as House Republican leaders, who oppose the bill, have
approved several hundred possible amendments to the 11 reform
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders attempted to suppress the issue earlier this
year, but agreed to a second round of debate after falling under
intense pressure from a handful of rank-and-file members who
joined Democrats in forcing the issue.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Swazi economy grew by
3.8 percent last year, the highest since 1990, Southern African
Broadcasting Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The high growth rate was a result of recovery of the
agricultural sector, the report quoted Swazi Minister for
Economic Planning Absalom Dlamini as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said that expansion of large firms also contributed to
the economic achievement.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not specify when the remarks were made.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said that the population growth rate had also declined
in the country, which he described as another positive aspect to
the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the unemployment of the southern African
land-locked country continues to grow at 12 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland has a population of less than one million people,
whose livelihood depends on agriculture and livestock.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Intervention only a Temporary Option for Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin suggested on Thursday that the United States would not
intervene to boost the weak yen, but later clarified his remarks
that intervention was an option at a time but in the long it was
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Testifying to a Senate committee, Rubin said the key to
restoring the yen's fortunes was to promote growth in Japan and
insisted that intervening in currency markets -- central banks
buying yen in the open market in a bid to drive up its value --
would not fundamentally change "anything."
</P>
<P>
"The weakness of the yen reflects the economic conditions in
Japan, and can only be remedied by restoring economic strength
in Japan," Rubin told the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Intervention is a temporary tool and not a fundamental
solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders interpreted his remarks as all but ruling
out the possibility of joint intervention by major industrial
powers to bolster the yen, prompting a wave of yen selling. The
Japanese currency plunged to 143.65 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
After aides hurriedly slipped him a note following the yen's
slide on the back of his remarks, Rubin clarified his statement,
insisting he did not want to "mislead" markets by implying
intervention was not an option.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone to infer though that we were suggesting
that in all cases intervention was not an appropriate strategy
for short-term effects. We have often said in the past that we
will intervene when appropriate or not intervene when it's not
appropriate. It's always a tool that's available," he told the
committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
"I may have implied that in some sense we have taken
intervention off the table. That certainly would have been a not
correct implication," Rubin later emphasized to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's bid to rephrase his earlier remarks briefly took some
pressure off the yen, but the battered currency quickly resumed
its slide and traded below 14350 to the dollar.

Japan's real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal year
fell an inflation-adjusted 0.7 percent from the previous year,
marking the biggest contraction since the current calculation
method's adoption in 1955, the EPA said in a preliminary report.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Launches New Roadside Air Pollution Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental Protection
Department (EPD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) said here Friday that, from Monday on, a new roadside air
pollution index (API) would be released daily in addition to the
existing general API.
</P>
<P>
When announcing this, Assistant Director of Environmental
Protection (Air) Tse Chin-wan said the aim of releasing roadside
API is to arouse more public awareness on air pollution caused by
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The current API follows the practices in many other cities and
reports the quality of the air which people usually breathe in
their homes and offices. Considering that there are many busy
roads in Hong Kong's urban area and that motor vehicles are the
major sources of the air pollution, the EPD has decided to extend
the current API to report also the level of air pollution by the
side of those busy roads, Tse said.
</P>
<P>
The EPD has been operating a monitoring station to measure the
air pollution in Mongkok for many years and the measurement data
have been published on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
A new monitoring station has been built in Causeway Bay and
another is being built in Central, both on the Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
The stations are to measure air pollution very close to the
tail-pipes of motor vehicles and the new information collected
through the stations would be of most use to those people who have
to spend long periods of time at roadside locations.
</P>
<P>
Tail-pipe emissions from motor vehicles not only pollute the
air but also often cause direct harm to passing pedestrians. The
control of air pollution from motor vehicles is thus one of the
top priorities of the SAR government, said Tse.
</P>
<P>
Together with the new roadside API, the EPD will now also be
reporting the general API for each of the monitoring stations as
well as using a new set of descriptors to describe different
levels of air pollution, he added.
</P>
<P>
API is a simple way of describing air pollution levels to
provide timely information about air pollution to the public and
to enhance awareness. Since June 1995, the EPD has been reporting
the daily API and making a forecast for the following day.
</P>
<P>
The API forecast serves also as an alert to the public before
the onset of serious air pollution episodes. It helps the general
public, especially susceptible groups such as those with heart or
respiratory illness, to consider taking precautionary measures
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The EPD reports both general and roadside APIs plus a forecast
for the following day. These indices are calculated by comparing
the measured concentrations of the major air pollutants including
nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide and
respirable suspended particulates, with their respective
health-related Air Quality Objectives (AQOs) established under the
Air Pollution Control Ordinance.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Assures Smooth Transition of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Friday promised what he called "the smoothest transition of power"
the country will ever see when he hands over the reins of
government to President-Elect Joseph Estrada on June 30.
</P>
<P>
"This, as your president, I have guaranteed, and this
commitment I shall deliver," Ramos told a huge crowd attending the
celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Philippine independence
at the Quirino Grandstand at the Luneta Park, Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the country's 13th president, will formally assume the
presidency and lead the country for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
He won by a landslide of more than 6 million votes in the May
11 elections in a 10-cornered presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Even before the elections were held, Ramos had pledged that
there would be a smooth turnover of power to the next president
whoever he or she might be.
</P>
<P>
Since Estrada was proclaimed by the Senate as the duly elected
president of the Philippines, Ramos wasted no time to congratulate
the incoming president and held a series of transition meetings to
brief the president-elect on the vast functions of the presidency
in running the government.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ramos also stressed the need to uplift the poor
with the government pursuing people empowerment by involving every
citizen in productive enterprise.

BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of foreign tourists
standing near the Tiananmen Square flagpole the morning with hands
raised in the air were not participating in a rally, but were
instead responding to a roll call conducted by their guide.
</P>
<P>
The initially nervous tour guide from the Dynasty Travel Agency
was noticeably relaxed after verifying the presence of all members
of the group visiting the world's largest square.
</P>
<P>
However, another young guide from the Beijing-based Jinhui
Travel Agency was not as lucky and was anxiously looking for a
missing tourist. "It's extremely difficult to find one person in a
massive square filled with people," said the guide.
</P>
<P>
Beijing continues to enjoy pleasant early summer weather and
crowds of domestic and foreign tourists visiting the square busily
snapped photos of the Monument to the People's Heroes, the Great
Hall of the People and the resplendent Tiananmen Rostrum with its
huge portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Tim Olsson, a 32-year-old tourist from Sweden, referred to a
guidebook as he cycled around the square on his new bicycle
purchased at local store. "The first thing I did after arriving in
Beijing was to visit the giant square. It's really beautiful and
fascinating," said Olsson.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianguo and his family from northern Shanxi Province found
accommodations in a small hotel near the square. Li and his wife
cited their desire to watch a national flag-raising ceremony held
in the square at sunrise.
</P>
<P>
While his wife grumbled about the high costs in the Chinese
capital, Li insisted on bringing their little girl to Tiananmen
Square which he regards as the symbol of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei, an official from a grain supply department in Nanyang
city in central Henan Province, strolled around the square with
video camera in hand. "I visit the square every time I come to
Beijing. Tiananmen and the square symbolize the dignity of the
nation," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zedong stood on the Tiananmen Rostrum on October 1, 1949,
to announce the founding of the People's Republic of China. The
rostrum faces the gigantic square which covers 440,000 square
meters.

The Chinese government organizes major activities in the square
to mark special occassions. Most days, however, the square
resembles a giant entertainment venue with local residents flying
kites, children scurry to and fro and young men donning
fashionable sportswear taking advantage of the open area for
rollerblading.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of people also enjoy visiting the cool square on
summer evenings.
</P>
<P>
The plaza at the east entrance to the Great Hall of People
located on the west side of the square is placid when compared to
the hustle and bustle associated with Tiananmen. People are
prohibited from strolling along the plaza which is one of the most
important diplomatic venues for the government. Chinese leaders
have rolled out the red carpet in the plaza to greet several
hundred foreign leaders over the past two decades. Related
ceremonies held in the Great Hall of the People during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
"I know that welcoming ceremonies are scheduled when the
national flags of China and various countries are displayed on
Chang'an Avenue which separates the Tiananmen Rostrum and
Tiananmen Square," said Liu Caizhen, a cleaner who works in the
square.
</P>
<P>
"Ceremonies were held a few days ago to welcome the Italian
president, and I understand that President Jiang Zemin will
welcome U.S. President Bill Clinton in the plaza," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
"My friends say some U.S. senators are opposed President
Clinton's participation in welcome ceremonies scheduled for
Tiananmen Square. It seems they lack any sense of protocol and
propriety," said Yang Yueru, a young teacher from the China
Agricultural University.
</P>
<P>
Yang referred Tiananmen Square to China's big parlor, and said
that how can a host receive a guest not in the parlor.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side warmly welcomed President Jiang (last fall) and
hospitable Chinese will in return leave a deep impression on
President Clinton during his China visit," said Yang, a 1989
graduate from the English Department at Central China Teachers
University.
</P>
<P>
Visitors and nearby residents gradually left the square later
in the evening. Many returned home to watch the live telecast of
the soccer World Cup under way in France.
</P>
<P>
The night wore on and the giant "M" designating the fast-food
McDonalds franchise store sparkled in the sky to the south of the
square.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Almost Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar clawed its
way above the key 59 U.S. cent level Friday to close almost
steady.
</P>
<P>
But foreign exchange dealers said that by no means was the
local currency out of the wood.
</P>
<P>
"There is little on the immediate horizon to lighten the heavy
baggage that the Australian dollar is carrying at present," the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Michael Blythe said.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney the Australian dollar was trading at
59.17 U.S. cents from 59.18 U.S. cents at Thursday night's close.
</P>
<P>
A trader said the Australian dollar was also helped by
unsupported rumors that a mining company was buying Australian
dollars to make a takeover bid for Australia's leading company BHP
Co. Ltd. and also by purchase of the Australian dollar ahead of
Monday's float of Australia's insurance giant AMP.
</P>
<P>
In a commotion-filled week the battered domestic unit plumbed
to lows last seen in the "banana republic" days of 1986 and fell
to its lowest ever closing level.
</P>
<P>
On June 10 the Australian dollar dropped to as low as 58.09
U.S. cents, the lowest level reached since July 28, 1986, when it
hit a record post-float low of 57.1 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"The risks on the currency front remain skewed to the downside
reflecting the Australian dollar's role as a barometer of
attitudes toward Asia, continued pressure on the Japanese yen,
concerns about trends in the current account deficit and commodity
prices and general negative market sentiment," Blythe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the downside risks for the battered currency had been
heightened by renewed concerns over the outlook for Asia which has
been reflected in fresh weakness in Asian equity markets over the
past week.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates Friday, the Australian dollar was trading at
85.16 Japanese yen from 83.88 yen at Thursday night's close.
</P>
<P>
It was also trading at 1.069 German marks from 1.0636 marks, at
0.3627 British pounds from 0.3634 pounds and 1.1787 New Zealand
dollars from 1.1792.

<HEADLINE> 39 Parties to Participate in Cambodian Assembly Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 39 political parties
will field candidates in the forthcoming elections in Cambodia,
the National Election Committee (NEC) announced Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The parties, which were registered on May 7, were formally
approved, including Prince Ranariddh's Funcinpec party, after an
examination that lasted one month, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
After the second discussion on the reintegration of troops
loyal to Prince Ranariddh failed on Wednesday, some analysts
suspected that Funcinpec would not be allowed to take part in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Prince Ranariddh warned in Phnom Penh that the
international community would withdraw its support from the
elections and would not recognize the results if he and his party
could not run.
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask "the friends of Cambodia" to help mediate
the reintegration of resistance forces, as well as pardons for his
top military commanders before the election.
</P>
<P>
All the 122 seats in the National Assembly will be contested
in the July 26 elections.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993 elections, which was monitored by
U.N. representatives, Funcinpec won 58 seats out of the 120 seats,
while Hun Sen's opposition Cambodian People's Party gained 52
seats.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 parties took part in the last elections.

<HEADLINE> Poverty to Be Reduced through Macroeconomic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
reduce poverty through combination of macroeconomic policies, high
economic growth and strengthened links and coordination among key
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Annual Development Plan for 1998-99, the first
year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, released here Friday, the
government will focus its attention more on the development of the
social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to further improve social development,
increase budgetary allocations for social development and boost
inter-governmental coordination and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government has made an overall increase of
18 percent in allocations for the vital Social Action Program
(SAP) for the new fiscal year (July 1-June 30).
</P>
<P>
The total size of allocations for SAP is estimated at 77.112
billion rupees (about 17.5 million U.S. dollars), a rise of 18
percent over that in the outgoing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
For the next fiscal year the SAP will mainly focus on
integrating social sector policies, mitigating institutional
rigidity and overcoming procedural inadequacies and consolidating
and expanding the services and programs launched and benefits
achieved during the last several years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Annual Development Plan, the government will
play a catalyst role in policies and programs of poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The government during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998-2003)
period will reinforce the process of sustained and integrated
economic growth and social development toward the enhancement of
the quality of life for all people.
</P>
<P>
The government's social agenda during the next five years will
be based on the three core areas of poverty alleviation,
employment expansion and social integration.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Special arrangements are being
made to permanently display the enormous gifts presented by the
Chinese mainland to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) on its establishment last year.
</P>
<P>
The gifts, presented by 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, will be shown at major public facilities, such as
the spacious new airport and the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center (HKCEC), as well as government office buildings
and museums, a government spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The HKCEC and the VIP lounge of the new airport will each
eventually have seven and four gifts for permanent display and the
large concentrations of the gifts should help create a positive
visual impact for visitors to Hong Kong, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Another major recipient is the Hong Kong Heritage Museum in Sha
Tin, the "New Territories," which will have six pieces on
permanent display when it is completed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
All of the gifts are "gems of superb craftsmanship,
representing the best of contemporary Chinese art," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Security, public exposure and the proposed venues' size and
floor loading are among factors considered when allocating the
gifts of embroidery, ceramics, lacquer work, tapestry and stone
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
Some of the items will be on display here for a month to
commemorate the first anniversary of the reunification of Hong
Kong with China.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 people gathered at
a reception here Friday in commemoration of the 60th anniversary
of the founding of the China Defense League by Soong Ching Ling.
</P>
<P>
The league is the predecessor of the China Welfare Institute, a
non-governmental organization engaged in medical, social and
educational work for the Chinese people and in particular for
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Founded by Soong Ching Ling in Hong Kong on June 14, 1938, the
China Defense League was aimed at collecting large amounts of
medical and material supplies from overseas to help China in the
War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
The relief organization also undertook the task of reporting to
the outside world the true situation of struggle in China. Based
in Hong Kong for three years, it received full support from Hong
Kong compatriots, overseas Chinese and many foreign friends.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's reception, Huang Hua, chairman of the
Shanghai-based China Welfare Institute, spoke highly of the
tradition of patriotism of the Chinese people in Hong Kong and
their deep concern for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee Hwa was present at the gathering, which was attended by
more than 200 representatives of all sectors from Beijing,
Shanghai and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Indian Talks Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday termed the
Indian offer for resumption of talks on June 22 as a "traditional
gimmickry of Indian diplomacy" and reiterated its call for active
international engagement in the dialogue process between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Thursday made an offer for the resumption of talks to
India on the basis agreed upon by both countries on June 23 last
year, a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement Friday
evening, responding to the Indian Foreign Ministry's offer earlier
in the day to resume bilateral talks on June 22.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of responding positively to this offer of talks on the
agreed basis India has asked for the resumption of talks on the
basis of the proposals made by New Delhi in January 1998," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"These proposals were not acceptable to Pakistan as a working
basis for resumption of talks as these were totally unrealistic
and reflected India's consistently negative and non-serious
approach toward dialogue," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indians have also rejected Pakistan's offer of a
formal test ban treaty between the two countries to defuse nuclear
tensions in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Even this rejection does not surprise Pakistan. India is
averse to any constructive proposal which it deems may serve as a
check on her provocative and hegemonistic policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This yet again highlights that bilaterally the dialogue will
remain deadlocked or non-productive."
</P>
<P>
"It forcefully underscores the imperative of the engagement of
the international community with this process in some form, namely
good offices, mediation or initiatives by the U.N. secretary
general," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pakistan formally conveyed its proposal for
resumption of talks to the Indian high commissioner here, saying
the Pakistani government invites India to send its foreign
secretary to Islamabad for talks on June 20. Meanwhile, Pakistan
declared a unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, an Indian Foreign Ministry announced in New
Delhi that the country would host foreign secretary-level talks
with Pakistan on June 22.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India agreed in their
talks here on June 23, 1997, to discuss eight issues including
Jammu and Kashmir and peace and security in their future parleys.
This was the first time that the two countries had agreed to put
Kashmir on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"By ignoring the agreed basis for talks and calling for
resumption of dialogue on the basis of its own proposals India has
in effect once again sabotaged the dialogue process," the
Pakistani spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It may be recalled that the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council in their meeting in Geneva last week as well as
the U.N. Security Council have urged resumption of dialogue for
addressing the root-cause of tension in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary general is also actively engaged in
promoting the dialogue process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"All these efforts are now being negated by India with her
obstructionist policies in defiance of the will of the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has welcomed the proposed visit of the U.N. secretary
general's special envoy to the region. However, India has rejected
any third-party engagement in the two countries' dialogue process.

HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kwai Chung Container
Port handled 3.79 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of
containers in the first five months of 1998, up 4 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
But the container throughput edged up just 1 percent in May,
Richard Yuen, secretary to the Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Combining container terminals at Kwai Chung and mid-stream and
river trade together, the container throughput was 2 million TEUs
for January and February this year, an increase of 4 percent over
the same period last year, Yuen said. Figures for March to May are
not yet available.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Southeast Asian financial turmoil is expected to
have some impact on the Hong Kong port this year, we still expect
a positive, healthy growth for our port this year," Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong maintained its position as the world's busiest
container port for the sixth year in a row in 1997. Including
container terminals and mid-stream and river trade, it handled 4.5
million containers in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Future railway infrastructure
development will bring more job opportunities in the next few
years, Hong Kong Secretary for Transport Nicholas Ng said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 64-billion-HK-dollar (8.2 billion U.S. dollars) West Rail
(Phase 1) project would create about 7,000 jobs in the employment
market in the coming 18 months, he told a ceremony to mark the
completion of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Hung Hom Station
renovation and expansion project.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Tseung Kwan
O extension and other railway development projects including
consultancy, the number of jobs will exceed 10,000 when all these
projects enter their peak construction phase," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Government figures showed that unemployment hit a relatively
high level of 3.9 percent between February and April due to
stagnant economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Ng pointed out that the government has taken an active approach
toward railway development to meet the demand of the traveling
public.
</P>
<P>
About 110 billion HK dollars (14.1 billion U.S. dollars) will
be spent on the three priority railway projects -- West Rail
(Phase 1), MTR Tseung Kwan O Extension and Ma On Shan to Tai Wai
Rail Link. They will all be completed within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the government is now examining other
new rail links to cope with the long-term land and housing
development in Hong Kong.

BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing No.1 Intermediate
People's Court will become the nation's first intermediate court
to enhance external supervision by opening trials to the public.
</P>
<P>
A Wednesday announcement stipulated that Chinese citizens over

<P>
The practice will also help increase the transparency of
trials, self-discipline the judiciary, and protect the legitimate
rights of individuals facing trial, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Chinese laws stipulate that all cases with the exception of
those involving national secrets, personal privacy and minors
should be tried openly. And, verdicts for cases not tried openly
must be announced to the general public.
</P>
<P>
However, few people were allowed to attend hearings in the
past, because of a small number of courts, insufficient functions
in the design of the court, a large number of cases, and the
length of trials.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing court invested over 200,000 yuan ( 24,000 US
dollars) to install an electronic screen and security gate in
order to guarantee the safety of the court and ensure convenient
access to those attending hearings.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton issued a broad defense of his
decision to seek closer relations with Beijing, arguing that
expanding cooperation is critical to preserving U.S. security and
"building a stable international order."
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan announced a moratorium on further nuclear weapons
tests, joining arch-rival India in calling a halt to underground
detonations that have prompted international condemnation of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton, responding to Congressional criticism of
his forthcoming summit meeting in China, described his policy of
cooperation with Beijing as "principled and pragmatic."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

<HEADLINE> China Introduces Strict Limits On Auto Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government
announced strict limits on automotive emissions today.
</P>
<P>
However, officials pointed out that the full effectiveness of
the new standards will require strict regulations on automotive
service stations and repair shops.
</P>
<P>
A bulletin released by the State Bureau of Machinery Industry
(SBMI) stipulates that all automobiles rolling off the nation's
production lines after July 1 this year will be required to reach
the new emission control standards equivalent to requirements in
European nations during the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
All automobiles weighing less than 3.5 tons will be subject to
a reduction of between 43 percent and 66 percent in emissions of
CO, HC and NOx.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin also contains emission standards for petroleum
and diesel engines produced domestically. Plans for 2002 call for
raising the standards to the levels in European nations during the
1990s, and still further to the global level by 2010.
</P>
<P>
SEMI Deputy Director Zhang Xiaoyu told a press conference today
that emission control standards will be complemented by
standardizing maintenance services.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China lacks a national regulatory system
for automotive maintenance and repair services. Zhang said the
common problem of related services is their failure to meet
technical standards set by automobile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Experts from relevant government institutes claim that proper
servicing will ensure that Chinese-made automobiles maintain
emission standards for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
They also note that joint experiments conducted by Chinese
government departments and US-based Ford Motor Company prove the
point.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts note that many automobiles fail to meet
emission standards due to improper servicing.
</P>
<P>
China plans to invest some 2.6 billion yuan (313 million US
dollars) to develop its ability to produce electronically
controlled fuel injection engines. In addition, the use of
unleaded gasoline is spreading throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
A joint Sino-US research and development project on emission
gas converters has entered the road testing phase.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Manufacturing to Grow by 7.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has set an overall
growth rate target of 7.2 percent for 1998-1999 in the
manufacturing sector with 6.5 percent in large-scale industries
and 8.4 percent in small ones.
</P>
<P>
Under the Annual Plan 1998-99 issued here Friday afternoon, an
allocation of 597 million rupees (about 14 million U.S. dollars)

1998-99 as compared with the estimated expenditure of 650.69
million rupees (14.8 million dollars) during 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic survey 1997-1998 issued on Wednesday,
the country's manufacturing sector grew by 7 percent during
1997-1998 while growth of large-scale manufacturing recovered from
last year's negative 2.3 percent to 6.2 percent. However,
small-scale manufacturing maintained its previous growth of 8.4
percent.

<HEADLINE> China Exhibits Mature Securities Market Management  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's maturation into an able
regulator of its securities market is best indicated by the
market's smooth operation and steady growth during a period in
which neighboring markets have been shaken by financial
instability.
</P>
<P>
The economists and stock analysts in China share the view and
note that the country's growing capability can be seen in the
improved management of the securities management system, as well
as proper policy orientation and maturing expertise in regulating
supply and demand on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
China initiated the reform of its securities management system
earlier this year by designating the China Securities Management
Commission (CSRC) as the sole administrator of the securities
market. Economists note the move will greatly enhance the
management efficiency of the market.
</P>
<P>
The government also adopted a series of measures designed to to
create a steadily developing securities market which will
facilitate the nation's state-owned enterprise reform effort.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's reduction of bank interest rates at the end
of March helped invigorate the bearish and sluggish stock
market. The move was accompanied by improved market sentiment
which led to rising stock prices and a daily turnover of more than
13 billion yuan (1.57 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Regulations governing the securities investment fund also went
into effect in March and reflected the strong determination to
foster rational and institutional investors in order to stablize
the stock market. Three securities investment funds are in place
and a fourth is expected to be offered to the public next
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> More Americans to Visit China This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China anticipates an 8-10 percent
rise in the number of U.S. tourists visiting the country during
1998, up from the 616,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Officials from China National Tourism Administration (CNTA)
announced the projected growth at the ongoing Sino-U.S. tourism
exchange fair.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy has witnessed steady growth in recent years,
with Sino-U.S. relations entering a new stage of development and
air traffic between the two countries on the rise. The officials
noted that visa procedures for U.S. tourists to China have
been simplified.
</P>
<P>
The fair attracted dozens of officials and scholars from the
CNTA, China Tourism Association, Beijing Municipal Public Security
Bureau, Air China, University of California, U.S. Champion
Holidays, and Palm Springs Tourism Corporation.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
China, participants discussed expanded tourism cooperation between
the two countries, with special emphasis on how China expands
U.S. tourism market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. participants said that an increasing number of Americans
have exhibited a desire to visit China. They also noted the
increased diversification of the country's tourism market and the
increased standardization of reception work.
</P>
<P>
Air China recently opened its Beijing-Los Angeles route and
plans to add three flights to the U.S later this year.
</P>
<P>
The fair was jointly sponsored by U.S. Champion Holidays
and China Xinhai International Travel Service.

<P>
Unruly market players have been subject to harsh penalties as
part of the effort to introduce special measures to squeeze out
market bubbles. Companies suspected to filing false annual reports
are not only subject to "special treatment" which sets official
limits on price fluctuations, but also face extremely strict
examination of interim reports. Trading is immediately suspended
with the emergence of abnormal price movements.
</P>
<P>
"The measures will prompt listed companies to improve their
performance, curb excessive speculation and effectively protect
the interests of investors," according to one market analyst.
</P>
<P>
Yet another example of the efficient market managements
involves the growing ability to expand the market without creating
volatile fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 30 companies and three funds listed on
the A-share market during the first four months of the year had
total capital of 20.48 billion yuan (2.47 billion US dollars), up
4.89 billion yuan (589 million US dollars) on last year's same
period.
</P>
<P>
The good timing of stock listings ensured that the market
remained steady in spite of the rapid expansion. By the end of
April, Stock indices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets grew
52.4 percent and 62 percent respectively when compared to the
previous year's period, with limited fluctuations standing at 21
percent and 11.4 percent.

FUZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The 990-year-old Qingjing Mosque,
China's oldest Islamic building, is being repaired in Quanzhou City
in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>

Quanzhou port, was the starting port of the "Marine Silk Road", a
famous ancient trade channel between the east and the west.
</P>
<P>
According to historic records, many Islam believers from
Arabic countries were living and doing business in the city and
had religious service in the mosque.
</P>

The repairs on the collapsed meeting room, exhibition hall,
guest room, and shower room is expected to be completed by the end
of the year. And the mosque's walls and leading hall for religious

<HEADLINE> Japanese Economy Posts Negative Growth in Fiscal 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese fiscal year for 1997, which
ended in March of this year, contracted from the previous fiscal year
for the first time in 23 years, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal year fell
an inflation-adjusted 0.7 percent from the previous year, marking the
biggest contraction since the current calculation method's adoption in
1955, the EPA said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The figure surpassed the previous record fall of 0.5 percent
registered in fiscal 1974 when rapid rises in oil prices hit the
Japanese economy hard, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The EPA attributed the contraction to negative impact on the
Japanese economy by the financial crisis in Asia and the collapse
of major financial institutions in Japan last fall.
</P>
<P>
Japan set a target GDP growth rate of 1.9 percent at the
beginning of fiscal 1997, then lowered it to 0.1 percent last
December.
</P>
<P>
GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within
the nation. Real GDP figures are adjusted for inflation and
seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
GDP in the January-March quarter dropped 1.3 percent from the
previous quarter in real terms, or an annualized fall of 5.3
percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand reduced the country's GDP growth by a negative
1.0 percentage point, and external demand pushed it down by 0.4
percentage points, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Among GDP components, personal consumption, which accounts for
some 60 percent of the GDP aggregate, edged up 0.1 percent in the
reporting quarter, after marking a revised 1.0 percent decline in
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment also rose by 1.7 percent from the previous
quarter, posting the first growth in five quarters.
</P>
<P>
However, corporate capital spending, another engine for the
economy, decreased by 5.1 percent in the reporting quarter, the
worst decline since the April-June period in 1965 when it marked a
6.1 percent fall, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell 3.8 percent from the previous quarter, the first
decrease since the January-March quarter in 1986, when they fell
by 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's real gross national product (GNP) -- GDP
plus net income from abroad -- declined by 1.5 percent, or at an
annualized rate of 5.8 percent, in the reporting quarter.
</P>
<P>
Real GNP for the full fiscal year shrank by 0.6 percent from
the previous year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the overall GDP data, economists at private
financial institutions said that it would be difficult for the
government to achieve its 1.9 percent growth target for fiscal
1998 under the current economic situation.

CHANGCHUN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Wang Limin and Zou Changzhong,
two farmers in northeast China's Jilin Province, have been
sentenced to four years' and three years and a half imprisonment
respectively for illegal killing of a Siberian tiger in Changbai
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Zou Zhitang, also a farmer, who was not involved in the tiger
killing but sold the tiger bones, had two years' probation under
suspended sentence of two years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
They were also fined between 1,500 yuan (180 U.S. dollars) and
2,000 yuan (240 dollars) for breaking the Law on the Protection of
Wildlife, according to a local court in Hunchun forest region.
</P>

Four farmers, two of them are still at large, killed a
100-kilogram male tiger held by an iron device in Changbai
Mountians in October, 1993 with hunting guns and hid the tiger
skin and bones in the houses of Wang Limin and Zou Changzhong.

<HEADLINE> HK Construction Industry Can Face Challenges of Change: Housing Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The construction industry of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is in a best ever
position to face tough challenges of change, Tony Miller, vice
chairman of the Housing Authority and director of housing, said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There can be few moments in our history when the challenges
have been greater. However, there can be few moments in our
history when we have had a construction industry better able to
face the challenges of change," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar of the on-going International Building
and Construction Exposition (IBEX'98) here on Friday, Miller said
that at a time when other parts of the economy may be running
slack, the industry is set to continue to run at full capacity for
several years to come.
</P>
<P>
Miller defended the government's decision to construct 50,000
units of publicly built houses every year, saying that although
half of SAR's population live in public housing, 148,000 families
are still waiting for public rental housing and it takes an
average of 6.5 years to get in. A steady production of that amount
of units will enable the Housing Authority to bring the average
waiting time down to three years.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will have 200,000 flats under construction at
any one time for the next three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of employment, Miller said that the estimate
of new jobs by SAR's public works and infrastructure projects over
the next 12 months is nearly 60,000 not including housing.
</P>
<P>
The public housing program had in recent years employed around
12,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers full-time. With still more
intense activity expected for the period of three years to come,
some 3,000 such jobs on site are to be added, he said.
</P>
<P>
Miller admitted that the local industry faces the real
challenges of quality, safety, environmentally friendly practices
and efficiency. Concerning the issue of quality, everyone
involved must start with a sincere commitment coupled with
professionalism, accountability and a clear understanding of
expectations, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for safety, the SAR government is determined to develop a
safety management systems. By 1999, all construction sites in the
SAR will be covered by a system which includes a contract
requirement for safety and independent safety auditing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day IBEX'98 provides a marketing platform for more
than 200 companies from over 10 countries and regions.

plans to set up its first self-regulatory organization,
sources of the industry said.
</P>

According to an industry source, the first business of the
interim body will be to prepare for a permanent council based on
proportional representation.

<P>
Within two years, each taxi owner will vote for an
association to represent him or her on the council. In the
interim, representation will be based on the composition of
provincial and metropolitan structures.

Japanese exporters and U.S. fund operators kept the dollar's
lofty levels against the yen intact, selling the U.S. currency on
rises to book profits, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said the underlying yen-selling trend has not faded, now
that the Japanese government has released worse-than-expected
gross domestic product (GDP) data.

The Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Friday Japan's GDP for
the fiscal year ended March 1998 dropped, for the first time in 23
years, by an inflation adjusted 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan's GDP for January-March fell by 1.3 percent,
or an annualized rate of 5.3 percent -- more than the worst fall
of 4.0 percent predicted by economists, and significantly worse
than the economists' average 1.1 percent drop forecast.
</P>
<P>
The market is trying to test 145 yen, said an analyst, adding
that if the dollar breaks 145, the next target will be 147 yen.

<HEADLINE> 40 Good Citizens Awarded by HK Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Man Chi-fung, who through his
alertness helped the police arrest a suspect in connection with a
taxi robbery case, was presented with a good citizen certificate
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Man also won a cash prize of 3,000 HK dollars
(385 U.S. dollars) from the police at the Good Citizen Award
presentation ceremony Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine other civic-minded Hong Kong citizens, comprising
37 men and two women aged from 13 to 50, were also awarded.
</P>
<P>
The youngest award recipient, 13-year-old Suen Chak-fan, saw a
man stealing money from a cash register in a stationery shop on
September 6 last year. The man gave him some money and told him
not to say anything before leaving the shop.
</P>
<P>
When the shop proprietor returned, Suen informed her of the
incident. Realizing that 580 HK dollars (74 U.S. dollars) had
been missing from the cash register, she reported the case to a
police officer outside the shop. The man was arrested in the
vicinity with the help of Suen.
</P>
<P>
The award presentation ceremony, held twice a year, was
organized by the Hong Kong Police with sponsorship from the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Almon Poon Chin-hung, member of the government's Fight Crime
Committee, praised the 40 persons for displaying outstanding
courage, alertness and resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
Since the Good Citizen Award Scheme was launched in 1973, 2,664
people have been presented with the award. Poon said: "This shows
the police have obtained extensive support and cooperation from
the public in maintaining law and order in Hong Kong," where the
crime rate is among the world's lowest.

<HEADLINE> Official on China's Labor and Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
accomplish the early stage of building a labor system and a social
security system in five years, said a Chinese official here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Such a system, said Li Qiyan, vice-minister of China's newly
established Ministry of Labor and Social Security, will secure
more job opportunities and enjoy social security for workers.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, Li said his ministry will undertake
the historic mission to facilitate China's current economic
development and a socialist market economy in the making.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister is here for the ongoing annual International
Labor Conference of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
China is ready to cooperate with the ILO and its members and
"learn from all other countries' useful experience in tackling the
problems of employment and social security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official said, his country will further
improve labor and social security laws, regulations and policies
"in the light of our specific national conditions."
</P>
<P>
"The realization of the above goal will be our country's new
contribution to the development of the ILO and progress of the
human society," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Li recalled, China has made
remarkable achievements in economic development and social
progress by implementing the policy of reform and opening-up, thus
improving the living standards of its people, who account for one
fifth of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, like many other countries, China, the most
populous developing nation in the world, is faced with great
challenges in the fields of employment and social security.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government pays great attention to absorbing useful
contents of international labor standards in the process of labor
legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the years to come, the Chinese government will, as always,
work hard for the healthy development of activities concerning
labor standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
About the ILO, he called for its members to handle differences
in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, seek common
ground, and work for solutions on the basis of broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is ready to make joint efforts with
other parties to bring a more responsive and cooperative ILO into
the new century," Li said.

MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Filipinos Friday put on a national
fiesta to mark the centennial of the Philippines' declaration of
independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
The official celebration started with the simultaneous ringing
of church bells across the country in the early morning. At 7
o'clock in the morning, President Fidel Ramos and dignitaries from
32 countries and regions re-enacted the declaration of
independence 100 years ago in Kawit, Cavite province, south of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo, leader of the revolutionary
movement, raised the first national flag and proclaimed the
country's independence from Spain which had ruled the country for
333 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President-elect Joseph Estrada hoisted a national
flag at Rizal Park as flag raising ceremonies were held
simultaneously all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the celebration was a centennial parade at
Luneta Park. The parade depicted the Filipinos' daily life
including fishing and planting and the Filipinos' struggle against
Spanish colonialist and Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
In his early message to the nation, President Ramos said that
"no other event...can ever approximate the full significance of
the stirring moment" of June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite.
</P>
<P>
Friday's celebration, he said, would "showcase our collective
achievements, our future aspirations and our capabilities as
individual achievers and as a competitive national team".
</P>
<P>
The grand parade started at 2:30 p.m. and lasted about five
hours. Immediately after, people would be treated a spectacular
fireworks display unprecedented in the Philippine history.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB),
one of the four biggest state-owned commercial banks in China, is
reported to have acted as an agent of the State Development Bank
(SDB) to handle more than 310 billion yuan in policy loans for the
nation's key projects.
</P>
<P>
The amount accounts for 75 percent of the total loans the SDB
has extended since it was established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, the CCB has taken advantage of its banking network
across the nation to help complete more than 1,000 such key
projects.
</P>
<P>
It also became a major fund provider for the SDB, having
subscribed a total of 54.5 billion yuan in SDB financial bonds by
the end of 1997. It promises to purchase another 12 billion yuan
in such bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
Formerly the nation's leading lender for the basic industries
and key projects, the CCB turned into the leading agent bank for
the SDB's policy-oriented lending business from 1994.
</P>
<P>
China decided to intensify the input into the fixed asset to
push up the economic growth to eight percent this year. As a
result, the SDB has revised its annual lending plan for 1998,
expanding the credit quota from 97.3 billion yuan to the current
120 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Drugs to Curb Anti-Apartheid Campaign Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Former South African police
officers revealed that apartheid security leaders once
ordered them to make use of drugs such as Mandrax, LSD and Dagga
in the manufacturing of substances for crowd control during
anti-apartheid riots.
</P>
<P>
Lothar Neethling, former South African Police forensic expert
Thursday told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
hearing in Cape Town that Mandrax, Dagga and LSD, confiscated
from dealers, were used in experiments aimed at producing a
powder that could then be sprayed into rioting crowds to sedate
them.
</P>
<P>
The TRC is a special court authorized by the Government of
National Unity led by President Nelson Mandela to investigate
various kinds of criminal and violent activities during the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Also revealed Thursday was that Roodeplaat Research
Laboratories (RRL), where substances to induce infertility in
black women and cultures for deadly diseases such as cholera were
manufactu, was nothing other than a base for the apartheid
security forces' dirty tricks campaign against their political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
A plan was hatched to poison President Nelson Mandela after
his release from prison with a substance which would cause steady
deterioration of brain function, according to Schalk van
Rensburg, head of research at RRL. Mandela was released in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims of RRL's poisons was former South African
Council of Churches secretary-general Frank Chikane, now
Director-General in Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office. He
survived only because the attack was botched.
</P>
<P>
In the words of RRL former head Daan Goosen, the apartheid
government spent at least 100 million Rand (nearly 20 million
U.S. Dollars ) of the tax-payers' money to establish RRL.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Sympathizers to Help Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday called on
international and humanitarian organizations and figures
sympathetic to Iraq to intensify efforts for the lifting of the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman made this call in a
statement to the Iraqi News Agency to clarify Baghdad's decision
to resist any future assistance subsumed under humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
An announcement made after a cabinet session June 6 said Iraqi
government had accepted humanitarian donations in the belief that
they would make it easier for those parties sympathetic to Iraq
to remain in touch with Iraq's attempts to bring its cause in
focus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said irrespective of their amounts, such
donations offered by sympathetic friends were not the sure remedy
for relieving the suffering of 22 million Iraqis under the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said the sanctions are still in place despite Iraq's
fulfillment of all requirements of U.N. Security Council resolution
687, adding that they should accordingly be lifted, starting with
implementation of Paragraph 22 of the resolution 687 as the first
step which provides the lifting of trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman thanked, on behalf of Iraqi government, all
those sympathizers, saying that "Iraq would maintain close
contacts with these parties and consult with them to follow
the best ways to achieve the noble goal of removing the
sanctions off Iraq."

<HEADLINE> Romania: One Million Families in Need of Public Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Short of public housing, one
million Romanian families are waiting for an apartment from the
government, Nicolae Noica, minister of public works and
territorial planning, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over September 1993-May 1998, the government allotted several
hundred million U.S. dollars from the state budget for the
completion of works on 36,147 flats, Noica was quoted as saying by
the Romanian national Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
Of the fund, an equivalent of 30 million dollars was granted in
1997 and 11 million in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 allocations for the completion of unfinished
apartments will total 45 million dollars, the minister estimated.
</P>
<P>
As shown by figures from the National Board of Statistics,
Romania's housing stock comprises a total of 7,810,000 units, out
of which 4,154,000 are in towns and cities, and 3,656,000 in rural
areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found out
that native teenagers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have very sound
functions of the heart, lungs, blood vessel and skeleton.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawn by researchers in the Qinghai Plateau
Medical Science Research Institute, after they conducted a
five-year test on 400 youngsters at the age of 13-16 of Han
immigrants and native Tibetans living at two different elevations
above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Major indices of the functions of the heart and lungs,
including the maximum volume of oxygen consumption, show that the
native teenagers can coordinate their heart and lungs functions
better than the Hans.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the difference is resulted from their ability of
environment readjustment during adolescent period and the ethnic
heredity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. First National Ocean Conference Opens in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- In the 21st century, the world
will look increasingly to the oceans for food, fuel, new medicine
and other resources, said U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the U.S. first national ocean
conference in Monterey, California, Gore said, "Already we see
troubling signs that marine resources are overstressed."
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the Clinton administration wants to
spend an additional 30 million U.S. dollars over the next three
years to improve the health of oceans.
</P>
<P>
The money, which environmental activists said was inadequate,
will go for new scientific exploration, preservation of coral
reefs in 18 locations and a new network of buoys and satellites to
monitor climate change.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 top scientists, business leaders and policy
makers attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, governor of California Pete Wilson and U.S. Senate
Barbara Boxer have reportedly urged President Clinton to extend an
existing moratorium, which expires in two years, to keep new oil
rigs from dotting the pristine coast.
</P>
<P>
Banning oil drilling off the California coast has long been a
top priority of environmentalists, who are concerned about
aesthetics as well as the danger posed to the marine ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Gore said Clinton would have more to say on the subject when he
arrives in Monterey on Friday.

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion Against Japanese PM Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives, or
the lower house of parliament, rejected Friday a no-confidence
motion against Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The motion was voted down at a plenary house session as the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which dominates the
powerful lower house, was against it.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party (SDP), LDP's one-time non-cabinet
ally, and New Party Sakigake, another LDP ally, also opposed the
motion, Kyodo News reports said.
</P>
<P>
The second of the kind against the Hashimoto cabinet, the
motion was filed Thursday by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ),
the Liberal Party (LP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP).
</P>
<P>
The three opposition parties criticized the cabinet for its
deflationary economic policy, poor handling of bad loans,
insufficient administrative reform, political corruption, and lack
of progress in talks on the reversion of the U.S. Marine Futemma
Air Station in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
If a no-confidence motion is passed, it would force the
Japanese prime minister to resign or to dissolve the lower house
for a new election.

PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO decided on Thursday to organize military exercises by
their air foces in Macedonia and Albania and to threaten Yugoslavia
with air strike on all its territory to stop the suppression in
Kosovo. The defense ministers of the alliance, meeting in Brussels,
increased their pressure, while the six-nation Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia will meet on Friday in London.
</P>
<P>
-- The atrocious lynching of a 49-year-old handicapped black man
last Sunday by Ku-Klux-Klan men in Texas has greatly troubled the
Deep South of America. James Byrd was brutally murdered by three
white men who hauled him behind a truck for miles. An intelligence
report by the U.S. government said in January that there exist 474
racist groups in the United States which are based on the theory of
white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the foreign ministers of the Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia will meet on Friday in London to discuss the situation in
Kosovo, NATO has threatened Yugoslavia with a military intervention
and has decided to start military exerecises in Macedonia and
Albania from July. The Contact Group could urge Yugoslavia to
withdraw its special military units from Kosovo and allow displaced
ethnic Albanian civilians to return home.
</P>
<P>
-- An international inquiry has been launched on the origin of an
abnormal radio-activity cloud registered over the past 13 days in
southern France. Abnormal radio-activity clouds have also been
reported in Switzerland and Italy. The Swiss have presented an
hypothesis on the accidental burning of cesium in an incinerator.

<HEADLINE> Old Rivals Belgium, Netherlands to Clash Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Belgium and old rivals the Netherlands
will again face each other in the same group at the soccer World Cup
finals but the outcome of their Saturday clash at the Stade de France
is hard to predict.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is hoping to repeat their 1-0 victory over their geographic
neigbour at the last World Cup in the United States four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Belgium has failed to win since then, losing to the
Orange Legion twice in the European qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Their effort this time in Group E was greatly hamstrung by the
dropping of veteran Enrico Scifo, the 32-year-old midfielder who
played a key-role four years ago.
</P>
<P>
A rift between coach George Leekens and Scifo, developed after the
Anderlecht midfielder was left out of a March friendly, was apparently
widening.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Netherlands, quarterfinalist at last World
Cup, has to rest their key striker Dennis Bergkamp on the bench for
most time of the opening encounter.
</P>
<P>
The English Footballer of the Year, haunted by an injury inflicted
at the English FA Cup final, is unlikely to play the full 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Captain Frank de Boer, however, becomes coach Gus Hiddink's another
injury worry after twisting his ankle in training earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Corporate Failures Rise Sharply in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of Japan's corporate
bankruptcies shot up 37.5 percent in May from a year earlier to
1,791, the highest monthly figure since 1984, a private credit
research agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
May was the 12th straight month in which corporate failures
with debts of 10 million yen (about 69,430 U.S. dollars) or more
rose from a year earlier, and the third in a row in which the
number topped 1,700, Teikoku Databank said.
</P>
<P>
Of the failed companies, 70.7 percent blamed the prolonged
economic slump to their bankruptcy, the agency said in a monthly
report on corporate failures.
</P>
<P>
Total debts left by the failed companies increased 55.5 percent
from a year earlier to 780.68 billion yen (about 5.4 billion
dollars), a record monthly high.
</P>
<P>
The agency predicted that large-scale corporate failures could
follow in view of the increase in bankruptcies among small and
midsize companies.
</P>
<P>
"Increased bankruptcies among small and midsize companies are a
prelude to large-scale corporate bankruptcies," it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said intensified deflationary pressure is causing an
increase in inventories despite production cuts.
</P>
<P>
All industries saw double-digit increases in corporate failures
from the previous year for the fourth consecutive month, with the
construction, manufacturing and wholesale industries the hardest
hit, it added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Deficit Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit dropped
by a dramatic 36 percent on an annualized basis from November 1997
to May 1998, thanks to expanded exports and shrunk imports.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was 425 million U.S. dollars in May, the Jerusalem
Post newspaper reported Friday, quoting figures released by the
Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The exports totaled 1.78 billion dollars, up 14 percent in
annual terms from November 1997 to May 1998 and imports 2.23
billion dollars, a decrease of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 47 percent of all imports in May were raw materials, and
74 percent of the exports were industrial products and software,
23 percent diamonds and 3 percent agriculture goods.
</P>
<P>
The declining trade deficit along with the increase of imports
of investment goods have seemed to reinforce Finance Minister
Ya'acov Neeman's claim that Israel is nearing the end of its
economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
The imports of investment goods went up 9 percent in the
March-May period after slumping by 10 percent from September 1997
to February 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Israel's Economist Intelligence Unit predicted
that Israel will see a only 0.9 percent economic growth this year,
the lowest since 1966, due to the continuing tumble in tourism and
investment arising from the ongoing Asian crisis.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will bring back the
support vehicles used in peace-keeping in Bosnia-Herzegovina and
offered by the British government to Malaysia for free, Defense
Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles, worth about 26 million ringgit (6.5 million U.S.
dollars) were lent to Malaysia's peace-keeping force to carry out
its duties in Bosnia-Herzegovina under the United Nations banner
and were now offered to Malaysia for free, he said in Lumut, some
290 kilometers northwest from here, where he inspected a parade by
members of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) Reserve Corps.
</P>
<P>
"The government decided to bring back the vehicles after taking
into account that it would cost 30 million ringgit (7.5 million
dollars) if we were to buy them and only about 2 million ringgit
(500,000 dollars) to ship them back," he was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would use special flights and Malaysia
International Shipping Corporation (MISC) ships to bring back the
last Malaysian peace-keeping force -- Malcon V and the vehicles in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the Malcon V troops, comprising 795 officers
and men, who had served in Bosnia-Herzegovina since last December
1, returned home Thursday, and the last batch would arrive on July
10.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Gulf War Victims Get 45 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to receive the
biggest compensation package of 45.387 million U.S. dollars in
the second half of this year, for expatriate Sri Lankans who lost
their jobs during the Gulf War, according to Labor Ministry
sources here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Sri Lankan Labor Minister W. D.J. Seneviratne
had held talks with the executive secretary of United Nations
Compensation Commission (UNCC) and the compensation package was a
result of the talks with the high officials of the UNCC.
</P>
<P>
The minister had successfully discussed the problems faced by
those who had lost employment in Kuwait during the 1990-91 Gulf
War and the present package will be disbursed among 18,000 Sri
Lankans, mostly women, some of whom were in dire straits and a
majority of whom were without employment, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka received 33 million U.S. dollars this year and last
year it received two installments of 15.9 million dollars in
March and an additional 48.8 million dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
There reportedly were about 100,000 Sri Lankan workers in
Kuwait before the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Announces Policy Toward Eritreans Living </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government said
Friday that its policy toward 550,000 Eritreans now residing in
Ethiopia "remains intact" and the Eritreans "can continue to live
and work peacefully in Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
However, the office of the Ethiopian government spokesperson
said in a news release, "Some who are in leadership positions in
security sensitive posts - such as telecommunications and the
electricity company - must take one month's enforced leave." But
"they can stay in the country," it added.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front,
which has a party office in Addis Ababa, must leave the country
but their families have a choice to stay if they wish to, said
the news release.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an office of the Eritrean Community Organization
(COM), the news release said, "The leadership of COM must leave
but their families have the choice to stay."
</P>
<P>
"Some Eritrean individuals who have been raising money for the
war while residing in Ethiopia and have been involved in spying
activities must leave the country," the news release said, adding
"Their possessions will not be confiscated and they can nominate
an agent to look after them."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the air raid on Adigrat in northern Ethiopia which
took place at 17:30 local time Thursday, killed four people and
wounded 30 civilians. A grain store of the Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission was also damaged during the raid,
according to the office of the Ethiopian government spokesperson.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teaching In Tibetan At University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The subjects of algebra, higher
math, mechanics, electromagnetics and atomic physics are now all
available in Tibetan for students at Qinghai Normal University,
something that is regarded as a milestone in Tibetan education.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rapid economic development in recent years,
Tibetans have found themselves in urgent need of Tibetan speakers
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education designated Qinghai Normal University
as a place to train bilingual teachers for the Tibet Autonomous
Region and the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan
because it has done a great deal in promoting the use of Tibetan
and in compiling teaching materials in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, it has compiled and published a
series of teaching materials in more than 500,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Normal has increased the number of majors for Tibetan
students to 14 and bilingual teaching is used in mathematics,
physics, chemistry and Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
Recent exam results have shown that the Tibetan language method
has greatly stimulated the Tibetan students in their studies and
has improved teaching quality. Tibetans now account for the
largest number of minority students at the university and 26
percent of the total student body.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai plans to
expand the scope of its consulting businesses in hopes that they
will contribute 0.45 percent of its GDP with 10 billion yuan in
annual sales, early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Shanghai had 7,380 companies in the
consulting business, employing 146,000 people, by 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sector generated 3.4 billion yuan in earnings last year, a
rise of 40.6 percent over 1996, making it one of the city's major
service trades, the sources say.
</P>
<P>
The business first got started in 1979, and the city's rapid
economic development has provided a lot of room to develop,
allowing nearly a thousand of the companies to do about two
billion yuan in business annually, accounting for more than half
of the sector's earnings.
</P>
<P>
The city has passed a number of rules and regulations to
standardize the consulting business, and, the end of 1997, had
singled out 125 of the most trustworthy companies and given
licenses to 600 consulting experts.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Post First Rise in Nine Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
staged a dramatic comeback in late trading to post its first rise
in nine days Friday as buyers moved in on bargain-priced major
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The market had started weaker after a big fall in gold and
mining stocks and a poor lead from the United States market, but a
solid afternoon recovery after a move upwards by the Australian
dollar meant the all ordinaries index ended 13 points higher at
2,571.7.
</P>
<P>
"The fund managers are buying the banks, they are buying the
yielders," Stuart Smith from Henderson Charlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
The late afternoon turnaround ended an eight day streak of
lower closes on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 37 points to 4,474.6, led by a
stunning rise in the stock price of global media giant News Corp.
Its ordinary shares soared 77 cents to 10.56 Australian dollars
while its preferred shares jumped 55.9 cents to 9.10 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications giant Telstra also received support Friday,
with its installment receipts rising seven cents to 3.65
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were steady to marginally higher, with Westpac
Bank's nine cent rise to 9.57 Australian dollars the best
performance of the majors.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank was 4.8 cents stronger at 21.053
Australian dollars, ANZ Bank was unmoved at 10.62 Australian
dollars and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia had a five cent
rise to 17.45 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished down 8.6 points at 1,042.6 on
the back of lower commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The major diversified resources concerns all had falls. Rio
Tinto closed down 24.1 cents to 19.259 Australian dollars. BHP
ended down 12 cents at 13.23 Australian dollars despite rumors in
the foreign exchange market that a multinational company was
buying Australian dollars in order to launch a takeover bid for
the resources giant.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks received a pasting, with the index dropping 35.4
points to 1,089.8 as the bullion price fell 5.95 U.S. dollars per
ounce to 287.70 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover Friday was 377.92 million shares at a value
of 1.24 billion Australian dollars (744 million U.S. dollars),
with falls outnumbering rises at 805 to 488.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Stock Exchange Boss Calls for Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The current legal and regulatory
framework in the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LUSE) market has retarded
investor confidence and impeded capital market growth,
LUSE General Manager Charles Mate has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Friday quoted him as saying in Lusaka that
the Securities Act has major flaws against a modern and
progressive stock exchange market.
</P>
<P>
"This situation requests immediate redress to ensure the
growth of LUSE market and success in winning investor confidence
and competitive advantage," said Mate.
</P>
<P>
A successful legal framework for a modern clearing and
settlement system should have clear definition of property
interests, mechanisms for asset segregation and protection of
investors'assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regulatory framework should be clear, transparent and
designed to include aspects such as monitoring and compliance,
comprehensive description of regulatory jurisdiction and
relationship among players in the market.
</P>
<P>
He tabulated a number of factors that are urgently required in
the capital market legislation to make any headway including the
recognition of LUSE central share depository where shareholders'
assets are managed by LUSE rather than having physical licences.
</P>
<P>
Legislation should also allow LUSE to transfer settlements of
assets into shareholders' accounts, allow the movement of assets
from seller's account to buyer's account at the stock exchange
and recognize nominee name and accounts as he plays the
intermediary between the issuer/registrar and the beneficial
owner.
</P>
<P>
Mate also called for the legal structure that will harmonize
the companies act, the bank and financial services act and the
competition and fair trading act.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Contributes Spreading of Rodent-Borne Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- El Nino phenomenon may have
boosted the population of rodents capable of spreading an often
fatal respiratory illness in the southwestern United States.
</P>
<P>
The warm ocean current was believed behind the increased
rainfall last winter, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDCP) warned Thursday against its health effect.
</P>
<P>
El Nino causes "winter rain and moderate temperatures, which
increase a type of grass that is fed on by rodents," said Dr. Ali
Khan, of the CDCP's National Center for Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
In turn, said the CDCP, the number of rodents potentially
carrying hantaviruses has jumped 10 to 20 fold during the past
year in the states of Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
That boost increases the potential for the viruses, in the
urine, droppings and saliva of deer mice, white-footed mice,
cotton rats and rice rats, to be transmitted to humans through air.
</P>
<P>
There have been 183 confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in 29 states since the first outbreak of the virus, named
after a river in South Korea, in the U.S. southwest in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Of those cases on the record, 43.7 percent were fatal.
</P>
<P>
The most recent cases occurred in Colorado and New Mexico
during the second half of April, the CDCP said. Two of the three
people who developed the illness died.
</P>
<P>
Early symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome include
fatigue, fever and muscle aches. Some patients also experience
headaches, dizziness, chills and nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
Later symptoms include coughing and difficult breathing caused
by fluid buildup in the lungs. Researchers believe initial
symptoms occur one to five weeks after exposure to the virus.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Weak Yen Inflicts Pain on Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A weak yen has been dragging down
other Asian currencies further this week, stirring fresh concerns
that the Japanese currency's slide would inflict new pain on the
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The yen fell to over 144 against the U.S. dollar Friday, the
lowest in eight years. During the week, the sliding yen has not
only dragged down other Asian currencies to their new lows in
months, but also shattered the stocks in the region.
</P>
<P>
A weak yen has cast a shadow over the recovery prospects of the
battered Asian economy since the depreciation of the Japanese
currency would severely hurt exports of other Asian countries,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The continuous tumble of the yen would affect the export growth
of Asian countries in two ways, they said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it makes Japanese companies more formidable
competitors in the world export markets.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, for other Asian nations that sell directly to Japan,
their products would become less attractive to Japanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the weak yen would limit the chances for
Asian companies, especially those Japanese companies' competitors
in South Korea and China's Taiwan province, to get rid of their
economic woes by increasing exports.
</P>
<P>
A weak yen also means that Japan could hardly suck in enough
exports from other Asian countries to help them recover from the
11-month-old regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, export growth in Southeast Asian
countries has actually declined because of a lack of bank
financing and weak Japanese demand.
</P>
<P>
Now, the depreciation of the yen has made the prospects for
export growth of other Asian nations bleaker.
</P>
<P>
The weak yen has also raised worries that a new round of
financial crisis might hit the region, if the Japanese government
fails to check the yen's downturn.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a new free fall of their currencies, Asian central
banks would have to maintain high interest rates, intensifying the
sharp downturn in domestic demand and further squeezing local
banks and hard-pressed borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, slow economic growth, more company closures and
more lay-offs would follow in the Asian countries that have been
hit by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides, for Asian companies that rely on Japanese capital to
operate, a cutback in lending by Japanese banks in response to the
yen's slide would also worsen an already suffocating credit
crunch.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the weak yen reflects Japan's faltering economy,
its continuous fall would prompt the Japanese to put more of their
capital in more promising investments in the United States and
Europe instead of other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Without enough funds to fuel the development in Asia, the
region's recovery process would take a longer time, experts said.
</P>
<P>
At present, they said, joint intervention by Japan, the United
States and other industrial countries may help keep the yen from
further falling.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States seems reluctant to do so, partly
because it believes that it would be futile given Japan's weak
economy, and partly because it is not persuaded that a new crisis
is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the yen is most likely to sink further and continue
to drag other Asian currencies down with it next week, economists
said, adding that the yen's downturn would make the Asian economic
prospects gloomier.

<HEADLINE> Falling Australian Dollar No Help to Wool Industry: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The plunging Australian dollar
would be of little benefit to Australia's wool growers until it
stabilizes, analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety, a national wool organization, said wool
prices held firm this week in the wake of recent heavy falls due
to the limited supply on offer.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar plunged below 60 U.S. cents this week,
near the lowest level in 12 years, under pressure from a weak
Japanese yen and attacks by international hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator closed four cents higher at 588
Australian cents per kg clean.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar remains low. However, it will be of
little benefit to the wool industry until it stabilizes,"
Wesfarmers said in its Wool Weekly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"As the dollar continues to weaken, many buyers are holding off
in anticipation of wool becoming cheaper before they begin
buying," it said.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers said limited supplies of wool between now and Spring
should bolster the market.
</P>
<P>
It said 45,658 bales were rostered for next week's sales, so
the market was expected to continue to hold firm, with small
increases likely.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said wool
prices leveled in Sydney but lost ground in west Australia's
coastal city of Fremantle at this week's auction sales.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator dropped 10 cents to close at 539
Australian cents per kg clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43,514 bales were offered for sale, with 21.7
percent passed in.
</P>
<P>
"Although a small offering and high pass-in rates kept the
market level in Sydney this week, exporters expect a weaker market
next week in anticipation of large quantities coming on the market
at the end of June," ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
Sales continue next week in Sydney and south Australia's port
city of Adelaide, with 45,660 bales rostered for sale, down 6,500
bales on the original rostered quantity.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Government to Present Budget for 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
present the national budget for fiscal 1998-99 in the National
Assembly Friday afternoon focusing on self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second national budget of the present
government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif since it came to
power after an overwhelming victory in the general elections in
February last year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the budget for fiscal 1998-99 will envisage
concrete measures in line with Sharif's avowed policy of
self-reliance to counter the economic challenges faced by Pakistan
after its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The federal cabinet is expected to give approval to the budget
proposals at its meeting Friday before they are presented in the
National Assembly late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of the forthcoming budget will be on
self-reliance, broadening of tax base, and checking of tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
The budget is being presented in the backdrop of economic
sanctions imposed by some Western nations in the wake of
Pakistan's detonation of nuclear devices late last month.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Sharif has instructed the
policy-makers to ensure minimum burden on the common men, while
making necessary adjustment in taxation proposals.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the impact of possible economic sanctions, and more
importantly, to move towards the cherished goal of self-reliance,
the new budget will focus on "breaking the begging bowl" and
"relying on one's own means."
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the government led by the Pakistan Muslim
League (N) presented its first budget after assuming power in
February, it was facing an uphill task of salvaging an economy
which was in shambles.
</P>
<P>
The new budget is also likely to see stringent measures against
the chronic loan defaulters as all incentives to recover stuck-up
loans had fallen short of the desired results.
</P>
<P>
An economic survey for 1997-98 released by the government
Wednesday reflected realization of the twin objectives of
marcoeconomic stabilization and a comfortable GDP growth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey showed mixed trends in Pakistan's economy,
including a 5.4 percent GDP growth rate, a 5 percent fiscal
deficit, a single-digit inflation rate and a serious revenue
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The new budgetary proposals are likely to be adopted by the
National Assembly on June 30.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 Dollar Cheques Stolen from Zambian Copper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one cheques worth 1.1
billion Kwacha (about 500,000 U.S.Dollars) were stolen from
the accounts department at the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) in Kitwe, forcing the mines' management to issue a stop
payment order to banks.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia Friday quoted some staff of the ZCCM as
confirming that the 31 Cheques were stolen from the ZCCM last week
and a police unit is investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the cheques is believed to a racket in
which some workers allegdly smuggled cheques which they paid to
some of the suppliers of the ZCCM, said the staff.
</P>
<P>
They said that the "culprits" issued the cheques to the
suppliers without consent of their supervisors and received
commissions in return.
</P>
<P>
"The people involved took advantage of the situation and
smuggled out these cheques to their favored suppliers in returen
for commissions," they said.
</P>
<P>
The racket was discovered when some of the cheques bounced and
the management was surprised because it had not issued the cheques.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM earns Zambia more than 80 percent of its foreign exchange
earnings.

<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Austrian hero of the match against
Cameroon Toni Polster put the 1-1 draw down to experience.
</P>
<P>
Polster scored a last-minute goal to snatch a 1-1 draw for
Austria. He said on Thursday:"When you've got experience, you know
it's never lost until the final whistle so you keep going."
</P>
<P>
"Overall we played well. We came into the match with great
heart and spirit even if we didn't manage the game very well early
on." said Polster.
</P>
<P>
Polster, a contervisial selection to the Austrian team, said he
didn't have to prove himself any more.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon defender Rigobert Song said:"We were very naive and
maybe that cost us the match. We thought we had the victory in our
pockets and relaxed. We still have a chance especially as everyone
in our group has drawn."
</P>
<P>
Cameroon coach Claude Le Roy was disappointed by the result:'I
think we can be very proud of the team but I'm a little disappointed
that the goal came so soon before the end."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Reduces Army to 33,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing re-organization of the
Zimbabwe national army has seen the 51,000-strong force being
reduced to 33,000 since the exercise started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The army will be further reduced when the authorities see fit,
said Minister of Defense Moven Mahachi in an interview with the
Daily Herald on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the force were being retrenched or retired to
enable new recruitment, Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
However, all these will remain a reserve force and can be
called upon if the need arises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said, "We will reduce the size of the army further so
that recruitment can take place. We need new blood, just like in
any other organisation."
</P>
<P>
On the proposed establishment of a Southern African
Development Community (SADC) peacekeeping brigade, Mahachi said
Zimbabwe's army is supportive of the idea.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that any foreign country wanting to help
should do so within the framework of SADC.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a number of developed countries
want to be involved in the setting up of the brigade.

<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- England coach Glenn Hoddle has
rejected the media's criticism that he tried to keep his team away
from media exposure.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle was criticised that he was shrouding his squad in a
smokescreen of secrecy after he insisted that the practice match
with French club Caen was played behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
"There was a misinterpretation of that game. It had nothing at
all to do with keeping the media away." Hoddle argued.
</P>
<P>
"It was just that we wanted to avoid the atmosphere of a 25,000
crowd. It would have inspired the opposition and it would have
affected our players as well." said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said:"I've been quite amused by the media's reaction to it."
</P>
<P>
But Hoddle refused to reveal who will partner captain Alan

<HEADLINE> Australians See Four Films Each Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Australians are going to the
movies more often but have fewer cinema chains to choose from,
figures released Friday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) show.
</P>
<P>
The average Australian pay to see four films a year, spending
more than 480 million U.S. dollars in the process, with the number
of paid admissions to cinemas rising 22 percent in the three years
to June 1997, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
But the number of businesses in the industry was dropping, with
16 percent fewer in June 1997 than three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The industry is dominated by eight motion picture businesses,
each of which had an income greater than 4.8 million U.S. dollars,
the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has 325 cinemas and 28 drive-ins, with a total of
1,050 picture screens around the country, mainly concentrated in
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
The industry employs 7,739 people, up 35 percent since June
1994.
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the motion picture industry earned 499 million
U.S. dollars during 1996-97, of which 66 percent were from box
office takings, the ABS said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese TV Manufacturers Locked In "Service War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- After a heated "price war" in 1996
and 1997, Chinese manufacturers of televisions are now trying for
a bigger market share by engaging in a "service battle".
</P>
<P>
The battle was started, market analysts say, when sellers cut
the price of well-known foreign brands of televisions like Sony
and National, at a time when Chinese manufacturers had no room to
cut prices further, so they turned to service as the next weapon.
</P>
<P>
After careful consideration, executives at the TCL Television
Company say they believe that it is more effective to increase
spending on service by 0.5 percent than to bringing the price down
by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Haier, another major Chinese brand, has been offering what it
calls "five-star" service, while its close competitor, Konka, has
introduced free at-home service.
</P>
<P>
TCL was then inspired to even keep files for its clients and
provide 24-hour service.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's World Cup Campaign Upset by Injury, Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's World Cup campaign, which
begins on Saturday with a group game against Spain, has been upset by
the injury of their star striker and internal scuffles.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Amokachi, one of the key Nigerian scorers at the last World
Cup finals four years ago, looks doubtful to spearhead the attack
after injuring his knee in training.
</P>
<P>
The former Everton player in English Premier League is racing
against time to recover in time but his chance to start in the Group C
game would be decided by a fitness test on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reigning African Footballer of the Viktor Ikpeba, the other top gun
in the team, has stirred controversies by describing the team's
preparations "a shamble".
</P>
<P>
Ikpeba, who helped French club Monaco into semifinals of the
European Cup, was unhappy for being played out of position and
expressed his intention to retire from international football after
the finals.
</P>
<P>
This decision looks ironic since Ikpeba has just forced a place in
the Super Eagles starting line-up in recent matches after years on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
One good news for the Nigerians is that midfielder Nwankwo Kano is
recovering from a stomach upset and should be fit in time for the
game.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile their rival Spain, whose famous national soccer league
makes great contrast to their lacklustre performance in international
competitions, is hoping to erase the tag of underachievers.
</P>
<P>
Spain, quarterfinalist in 1986 and 1994, has never surmount the
barrier beyond last eight.
</P>
<P>
Much will rest on the younger shoulders of 20-year-old Real Madrid
striker Raul Gonzalez, who has won two championship medals.
</P>
<P>
The left-footed forward with great vision and maturity will be
aided in the front by club teammate Fernando Morientes.
</P>
<P>
Morientes made an extraordinary debut against Sweden in March with
two goals in the first five minutes and added two in his second match
against Northern Ireland earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The man on the goal will probably be 36-year-old Andoni Zubizarreta
who boasts 123 caps and has been the first choice since 1986.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture sector of
China's Guangdong Province has become a new investment spot for
overseas investors, partly owing to the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A number of overseas investors have shifted their focus to
agriculture, which has lower risk but higher returns.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the province added 26
overseas-funded agriculture projects worth nearly 54 million US
dollars, both of them a more than 44 percent increase from the
same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The increased spending has helped the local opening up of
agriculture, which now has investors from 20 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The province has developed a series of measures to
internationalize local agricultural development by building
overseas-funded pilot zones, improving infrastructure, training
personnel, and providing technology and services.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is situated close to Hong Kong, Macao, and Southeast
Asia, and has distinct advantages for export-oriented
agriculture.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine community living
in Hong Kong celebrated Friday the 100th anniversary of the
Philippines' declaration of independence from Spanish colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
There are around 160,000 Filipinos living in the city, of whom
140,000 are domestic helpers.
</P>
<P>
A red marker was unveiled Friday afternoon on Morrison Hill
Road, Wanchai, to commemorate the birth of the Philippines' first
national flag in Hong Kong 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The flag was handmade by Philippine patriots, one of them a
seven-year-old girl, in May 1898 in the residence of Felipe
Agoncillo, the first Philippine diplomat, said Consul-General of
the Philippines Estrella Berenguel.
</P>
<P>
The flag was brought back to the Philippines and raised on June
12, 1898, when General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first Philippine
president, declared independence in Cavite province, south of
Manila, she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The flag, designed by General Aguinaldo himself, has blue and
red stripes and a white triangle, enclosing a gold "Sun of
Liberty" with eight rays and three five-pointed gold stars, one in
each corner. The flag is now kept by the family of General
Aguinaldo.
</P>
<P>
Centennial celebrations will last the whole day, according to a
spokesman for the Philippine Consulate General. From a national
flag raising ceremony in the morning to the unveiling of the
marker in the afternoon to a grand reception hosted by the
consulate general and a party open to the public in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Tung Chee Hwa will attend the reception, he said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang departed Thursday for Manila
to attend the Philippine centennial celebrations on behalf of the
SAR government.

<P>
CHANGSHA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are making an
effort to save human gene resources in a nationwide operation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geneticists said recently that human gene resources
need to be protected through a coordinated effort.
</P>
<P>
The news came at a national symposium on genetic resources
collection sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology and
Ministry of Health's China Biological Engineering Center.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 1.2 billion people including 55 ethnic
groups, and a large amount of genetic isolation groups and many
types of diseases. In some remote areas, scientists have found
many members belonging to one family by blood concentrated in a
locality that is good for developing human genetic resources and
for new genes for dealing with diseases.
</P>
<P>
A state genetics lab was established at Hunan Medical
University in 1991 which has cloned 9 human genes. It has also
established a data bank of Chinese disease types that has a cell
bank of chromosome mutation of the Chinese and a DNA sample bank.
</P>
<P>
Xia Jiahui, head of the lad, says that by April the lab had 31
types of diseases. The lab has also established 444 cell strains
and 2,137 DNA samples.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Chinese Grain Producer Using New Type Of Manure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, a major
Chinese grain producer, is spreading the use of a new type of
manure that makes crops mature faster and increases output and is
better for the soil.
</P>
<P>
The new active bacteria manure uses decayed moss, a certain
kind of coal, and other organic compounds and takes in
microorganisms as it ferments, according to Qu Jichun, an engineer
at the Provincial Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang is rich in organic matter, with a fifth of China's
total amount of peat. The science academy experimented with these
resources and developed seven kinds of bacterial manure after a
dozen years of research.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province produced 2,000 tons of compound manure
which was used on 2,930 ha of experimental plots. The bio-manure
has been applied to 8,000 ha of land in the province so far this
year.

<HEADLINE> Using Technology To Produce Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Advanced technology is now being
used by a company in east China's Shandong Province to replace
older methods of producing the traditional Chinese
medicine 'donkey-hide gelatin', to improve both quality and
quantity.
</P>
<P>
Donkey-hide gelatin, or E-gelatin, is made by boiling a donkey
hide and refining the results to use it as a blood tonic. The
gelatin is referred to as Dong'e E-gelatin, after its place of
origin, Shandong's Dong'e County.
</P>
<P>
Previously, most of this work was done by hand. Then, in the
1980s, the Shandong Dong'e E-gelatin Group, China's largest
E-gelatin producer, started using technology to condense the
E-gelatin, shortening the production cycle from 60 days to 30
days. And, the microwave drying equipment the group used took 6 more
days off the production cycle.
</P>
<P>
The group also began using computer controls to increase the
ratio of quality products from 55 percent to 86 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the January-April period this year, it had 57.9 million yuan
in sales, up 23 percent from the same period last year and its
pre-tax profits increased by 52 percent to 20.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Its products are also being exported to ten countries and
regions, including the U.S., Japan and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Be More Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Leading Singapore newspapers
Friday urged Japan to be more responsible and to do much more to
avoid triggering a new round of Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the Lianhe Zaobao, published in Chinese, said
the depreciation of the Japanese yen has brought "snow plus frost'
effect to the Asian economy which has been already battered.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Chinese proverb that "let the mischief-maker undo the
mischief," the paper urged Japan to shoulder more responsibility
and take positive measures to stabilize its currency.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper The Straits Times said in a commentary
that "a weak yen to boost Japanese exports will hit other Asian
countries, which are doing their damnedest to pump up exports as a
way out of their financial miseries."
</P>
<P>
The paper proposed that Asian leaders get together and explore
what they can do collectively to restore confidence in the region,
and send strong signals to the capital markets that Asian leaders
are taking collective action to address some of their problems.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of letting the yen fall to jumpstart an anemic
Japanese economy, Tokyo could take stronger steps to reflate it,"
the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Japanese have already put up several fiscal
packages including April's offering of 128 billion U.S. dollars in
tax cuts and public works spending to boost domestic demand, the
paper said that "this has proved insufficient."
</P>
<P>
"Which suggests that more, much more has to be done," the paper
highlighted.
</P>
<P>
The paper also noted that there are rooms for Japan to take
other moves to complement fiscal stimulus.
</P>
<P>
The paper also warned that competitive devaluation is a policy
that is "ultimately self-defeating."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen had been sliding downhill steadily for more
than two months and finally collapsed Monday through the barrier
of 140-yen against the U.S. dollar, hitting its lowest point in
seven years and breaching a psychologically crucial level.
</P>
<P>
The yen's unabated fall has made the region suffering and is
threatening to spark a new round of Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Hit with Second Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman, star of the
Chicago Bulls, has been sued for the second time in less than a
week, this time by a woman who claimed the NBA player sexually
assaulted her in April at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed Wednesday by Dixie Johnson, a Clark
County resident.
</P>
<P>
"On April 19, 1998, inside of the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and
Casino, defendant, without cause, consent or provocation, sexually
assaulted plaintiff by physically grabbing her left breast and
shaking it," the federal lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
It claims Rodman's actions violated the federal Violence
Against Women Act. Johnson is seeking compensatory damages of
300,000 U.S. dollars and punitive damages of 3 million dollars,
plus attorney fees and costs of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, James Brasich, a craps dealer, filed a lawsuit
against Rodman in District Court, claiming the basketball player
humiliated him at work in October by rubbing his bald head,
stomach and groin with the dice before rolling them.
</P>
<P>
Brasich is seeking 300,000 dollars in compensatory and punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
Richard Howell, Rodman's lawyer, said:."These kinds of
allegations against individuals like Dennis Rodman at some level
come with the territory. It's something we've dealt with in the
past. We've been successful in the past and we have every
confidence we will be successful in the future."
</P>
<P>
Rodman, a famous and notorious figure in NBA, stole the
attention yesterday in Game 4 when he shot in 5 of 6 ball at the
line in the final minutes.

LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. semiconductor
company Thursday reported a fiscal fourth quarter loss due to a
drop in sales for personal computers and networking products.
</P>
<P>
National Semiconductor Corp., based in Santa Clara, California,
said its revenues fell from quarterly 652 million dollars a year
ago to 510 million U.S. dollars in the quarter that ended May 31.
</P>
<P>
The company also reported a net loss of 69.3 million dollars
for the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of 57.4 million
dollars in the year-earlier fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Current weekly order rates suggest that the market decline may
be bottoming out," Brian Halla, National Chief Executive, said in
a statement. "But visibility is limited and the outlook for the
current quarter is essentially flat with the fourth quarter."
</P>
<P>
North American market, National said, was the most affected by
the decline in orders, followed by Southeast Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter sales of analog products, led by power and
data acquisition devices, improved from weakness in the third
quarter but declined from a year ago, it added.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Founder to Enter DPRK Via Panmunjon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chung Joo-young, founder and
honorary chairman of the Hyundai Group, will enter the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on June 16 through Panmunjon,
said South Korea's Ministry of Unification on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chung will be South Korea's first businessman to enter the DPRK
through the armistice village of Panmunjon since the Korean
peninsula was divided into two parts in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his brothers and sons, Chung will go to the DPRK
for the purpose of hometown visit and consultation for economic
cooperation, including a tourism project of Mountain Kumkang at
the invitation of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The permission of Mr. Chung's visit to the North was in
accordance with the Measures for the Promotion of the Inter-Korean
Economic Cooperation, enacted on April 30, 1998," said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chung, visited the DPRK once in 1989, will take with him 50
trucks loaded with 500 cows in this visit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Chung, whose hometown is now the DPRK's
Tongchon, announced he would donate 1,000 heads of cattle to the
famine-ridden DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"I will drive the cattle into the North through Panmunjon
within a month. North Koreans can use the cattle as they please,"
the 83-year-old business tycoon said.
</P>
<P>
The 500 cattle will be delivered to the DPRK at Tongilgak on
the DPRK's side of Panmunjon through the (South) Korean National
Red Cross (KNRC) and the 50 trucks will be given to the DPRK in
terms of credit.
</P>
<P>
Another 500 cows will be transported to the DPRK after
inter-Korean consultations.
</P>
<P>
"Upon the fact that the visitors and the KNRC aid of 500 cows
use Panmunjon for their trip, the government of the Republic of
Korea hopes the inter-Korean relations progress further," said the
Ministry of Unification in a statement.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Scientists Becoming Shareholders (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- There used to be a popular saying
in China which goes as "those who make guided missiles earn less
than the ones who sell eggs boiled in tea", a vivid portrayal of a
strange phenomenon that lasted into the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
Even then, technicians received no reward for their scientific
research discoveries and lived on skimpy salaries with no other
source of income, while less educated people were making big money
in the wake of the country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
This is no longer the case. "Knowledge is power, technology is
knowledge, and in present-day China, knowledge means wealth,"
commented a noted sociologist.
</P>
<P>
The expert pointed to the fact as a growing number of Chinese
scientists and research personnel have become shareholders of
companies they work for and contribute their research findings to
as a form of investment.
</P>
<P>
The Dongjiang Group, northeast China's Liaoning Province, for
example, is a data-processing company with 200 million yuan in
fixed assets, in Liaoning Province, which recently gave a fifth of
its 50 million shares to a dozen technicians as a reward for their
outstanding work.
</P>
<P>
Li Peiying, chairman of the board of directors, explains, "I
have no regret about giving out such a large amount of shares to
technicians as the move closely ties company interests to those of
the technicians and encourages them to be more creative."
</P>
<P>
In this age of fierce market competition, he says, the key to a
company's success is to be always in the forefront of science."
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuan, head of the Research Institute of Beijing
University's Founder Group, says that his institute will provide
100 scientists opportunities to become wealthy by introducing the
concept of "technology for shares".

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Scientist Become Shareholders (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a decade ago, Wang got no remuneration when he developed
computer technology for Chinese character phototypesetting that
now accounts for 70 percent of the market shares in China and has
been exported to Europe and many countries in Asia. It is worth an
estimated 2.5 billion yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
"My company offered a fitting financial reward for my
contributions. But I didn't expect to take it at that time," Wang
recalls.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Science and Technology official attributes this
welcome change to the growing respect for knowledge and
professionals in Chinese society. An earnest government effort to
protect intellectual property rights and to commercialize
scientific developments has also encouraged the "technology for
shares", she says.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government departments have passed laws to protect
software, patents, and contracts, while local governments have
said at local trade fairs that they welcome Chinese and foreign
technicians to contribute to local economic growth by providing
their research findings and getting stock in return.
</P>
<P>
And, Chinese scientists and technicians have shown an interest
in becoming shareholders. When the Science and Technology Ministry
and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce came up
with their "Regulation on Questions Relating to Contributing New
and High Technology Research Findings as Shares", quite a number
of technicians asked for copies of the regulation and related
materials.
</P>
<P>
A more expanded view is expressed by Liu Yuhui, a shareholder
of Alpine Software Ltd. in Liaoning Province, who says, "The
practice of 'technology for shares' allows a technician to have a
sense of accomplishment. The interests of individuals is in direct
proportion to the development of their companies."
</P>
<P>
Gu Haibing, a professor at People's University of China says
that this 'technology for shares' trend makes researchers more
enthusiastic but it also results in greater respect for knowledge
and increased family input in education. So, it is important for
improving China's economy and national strength.

Notwithstanding the problems, the government has managed
development in an orderly manner by not borrowing from abroad,
unlike some other countries, he said. "A country heavily indebted
to another will find itself unable to repay the loans and as such
has to bow to the demands of foreign powers."
</P>
<P>
He said the federal and state governments would ensure that the
people get as much facilities as possible without neglecting those
in the rural areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Outlook in Second Half Not Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hopes of booming exports in
Thailand are slim in the second half of this year, and the
country's exports will show small, or in the worst case, no growth
at all over the first half, exporters said.
</P>
<P>
Four groups of exporters -- electrical appliances and
electronics, vehicles and parts, plastic pellets and products, and
tableware -- met Commerce Ministry officials on Thursday to study
the export performance for the second half, the Bangkok Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Exporters agreed to the revision of export growth for 1998 to
only 1-2 percent in terms of the U.S. dollar from the earlier
estimated 7.1 percent, and the revision of export target to about
57 billion dollars from 62 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The revision stemmed from a significant drop in exports in the
first two months of this year which fell by 2.7 percent to 17
billion dollars compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Karun Kittisataporn, director-general of
the Business Economics Department, as saying that exporters had
complained that fundamental export problems have remained unsolved
such as tight liquidity, high import taxes on raw materials for
the petro-chemical and steel industries, and delays in value-added
tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
Exporters also claimed that their operational costs have soared
due to much higher cargo freight charges by foreign shipping firms
and insufficient containers.
</P>
<P>
Karun said exporters have planned to expand exports to emerging
markets such as East Europe and the Middle East to boost the
overall export value in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with the Commerce Ministry's plan to
reinvigorate exports in the second half of the year, he said.

WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit by U.S.
President Bill Clinton to China will provide a historic
opportunity for the United States to improve its relationship with
China, said U.S. Senator Max Baucus on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Baucus, who will accompany Clinton to China, said that there
are people who want to isolate China, but the result of doing that
would be far worse than working in a constructive manner to make
China a freer, more open society that honors world peace.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of alleged transfers of sensitive
missile technology to China, Baucus warned that these allegations
will hinder potential progress in U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "If we turn our back on the Chinese and ostracize
them, then we risk peace in the world. If we extend our hand, as
the world's greatest nation, then we open the door to literally
more than a billion opportunities and secure a better and more
peaceful future for all of our children."
</P>
<P>
Baucus outlined the agenda for the visit. He said the meetings
between Clinton and Chinese leaders will focus on:
</P>
<P>
-- Maintaining a peaceful and strategic relationship in Asia,
working with China to continue the peace there and halting the
spread of nuclear weapons in the region;
</P>
<P>
-- Granting China permanent Most Favored Nation trading status
and prodding China to join the World Trade Organization; and
</P>
<P>
-- Engaging China in addressing environmental problems that
have implications for the entire world.

sector 30.2 percent and the cooperative sector 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite less export of rice for domestic demand, export of
other commodities such as cotton, jute, beans and pulses, silver
and tin, petroleum products, timber, fish and prawn, and sugar,
increased in the fiscal year especially through the border trade,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Of the export goods, products of agriculture shared 29.9
percent, animal 15.7 percent, forest 21.6 percent, industry 30.1
percent and minerals and gems 2.8 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar imported 14 percent more of the value of goods in the
1997-98 fiscal year than the previous year. Major import items are
capital goods, industrial raw materials, spare parts and consumer
goods, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the country mostly traded with Asian
countries which accounted for 80.2 percent of its total export
value of 914 million dollars in the last 1996-97. Of that, 46.8
percent deal with Southeast Asian (SEA) countries.
</P>
<P>
Of Myanmar's import value of 1.96 billion dollars in the
1996-97, 86.1 percent are from Asian countries, in which 49.3
percent are from SEA nations.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Multimedia Advertising System Launched in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday launched a
new medium called the Electronic Multimedia Advertising System
(EMAS), the first system in the region which intersperses
advertisements with real-time news.
</P>
<P>
The new medium is a joint venture project between Interconnect
Communication Private Limited, a local multimedia firm, and
Bernama, the national news agency.
</P>
<P>
The system is fundamentally an electronic advertising network
broadly incorporating IT multimedia and communication technologies
on a Stand-Alone Wide-Area Network (WAN) system to bring
exclusively business advertisers to the public.
</P>
<P>
Its uniqueness is clearly defined by the integrated real-time
on-line news and newsbreaks provided by Bernama as part of the
display.
</P>
<P>
EMAS is aimed at inducing total participation of the Malaysian
business world to advertise electronically at designated high mass
flow congregations such as supermarkets, shopping malls,
hospital/medical centers, banks, transport terminals and
government public service concourses.
</P>
<P>
The system will be installed in six places in the Klang Valley
(Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas) before it goes nationwide
next year.

<HEADLINE>   Scientists: California Pines Threatened by Killer Fungus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A killer fungus, which causes
the pitch pine's canker, is threatening some species of coastal
pines throughout California, scientists warned.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit is the giant Monterey pine that rises in splendor
from the rolling hills shouldering the Pacific Coast, scientist
said, adding that 80 percent could be destroyed in the next 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Infected trees first go brown at the ends of their branches,
then erupt in sports of oozing pitch and debris. Water and
nutrients are choked off within the tree, and the open infections
allow bark beetles to bore into tree trunks and lay eggs that
hasten the deadly process.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found any way to stop the disease," Bill Libby, a
tree geneticist for Fletcher Challenge Forestry, told the local
media.
</P>
<P>
California is home to three of the world's five native Monterey
stands. The environmental threat spreads far beyond California.
The Monterey species is the most widely planted non-native tree in
the world, serving as the core of multibillion-dollar timber
industries in Chile, New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Chile, Australia and New Zealand are visiting
California to get a look at the problem, and New Zealand this year
banned all imported pine seeds to try to keep the fungus out.

<HEADLINE> Shrimp Farms May Cause Food Crisis in Thailand:Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water from shrimp farms will gradually seep into the soil and
increase salinity to levels which make rice growing impossible,
today's Nation newspaper quoted the experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Waste water released from shrimp farms usually has a much
higher level of salinity, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They explained that salt could contaminate the water and seep
into the soil's texture. Salt from shrimp ponds was found to seep
into water at depths of 600-800 meters underground.
</P>
<P>
Inland shrimp farming has gained popularity in Central Thailand
in the past few years and many rice paddies have been converted.
</P>
<P>
Somsri Arunin, chief of the Soil Salinity Research Group under
the Land Department, said the central region -- with only nine
million rai (1.44 million hectares) of rice paddies -- produces
about seven million tons of the country's total 21 million tons of
rice.
</P>
<P>
"If we allowed prawn farming to continue in the paddy fields,
we will lose the best area for rice growing. And we might soon
face a food crisis," Somsri said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was true that now the impact in the central region
was not clear, but "we will face the problem a few years later
because it takes about five years for salinity to collect in
underground water and soil."

<HEADLINE> Health Warning on Eating Raw Oysters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. disease control
organization Thursday warned people not to eat raw or undercooked
shellfish, saying bacteria in the seafood could cause potentially
life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) said one
person died and 208 others contracted illnesses from shellfish in
the United States and Canada last summer.
</P>
<P>
All 209 people tested positive for Vibrio Parahaemolyticus,
bacteria commonly found in shellfish which can cause diarrhea,
nausea, stomach cramps and fever. Most patients reported eating
raw oysters and some reported eating mussels, crabs and other
shellfish before falling ill.
</P>
<P>
The oysters had higher-than-normal concentrations of the bacteria,
perhaps because of warmer water in the Pacific Ocean, the CDCP said.
</P>
<P>
The illnesses were reported in California, Oregon, Washington,
Alaska, Hawaii and British Columbia in Canada during July and
August last year.
</P>
<P>
The CDCP recommended cooking shellfish to kill the bacteria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Laxity in Pursuing Child Labor Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the United States
Labor Department admitted Thursday that they have not been
vigilant enough in pursuing and punishing repeat offenders against
child labor laws.
</P>
<P>
But while promising to employ new techniques such as using
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employer identification numbers to
track repeat violators, the officials suggested some of the worst
abuses -- those involving field work picking produce -- won't drop
greatly so long as seasonal farm workers remain so poor.
</P>
<P>
"Children work in agriculture because of poverty,... because
their parents need their contributions to family income," John R.
Fraser, acting director of the Labor Department's wage and hour
division, told a Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
"A majority of farm workers are not covered by the federal
minimum wage, (and) farm work wages in this country have been
stagnant or declining for 20 years," Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the average annual income for these families is
only 6,000 dollars, compared to nationwide average of 28,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Until we deal with those policy questions, we're not going to
come to grips with the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Clinton administration, Fraser and Gene
Sperling, head of the White House's National Economic Council,
endorsed proposed legislation by Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat.
The legislation aims at eliminating many exemptions for
agriculture in current child labor laws, increasing fines and
double enforcement spending.
</P>
<P>
However, Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican, who chaired
Thursday's hearing before a Senate subcommittee, criticized the
administration's enforcement of the present law's assessment of
fines for many of the abuses.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said his department has referred several cases to
Justice, but none has been prosecuted since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Fraser was also questioned about a five-part Associated Press
series last December entitled "Children for Hire." In this, AP
reporters spent over five months in finding children working
illegally in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
"We never had the complete list of where the AP believed they
had found child labor violations," Fraser told the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
But asked about the extent of such violations, Fraser said a
study by Rutgers University labor economist Douglas L. Kruse for
the AP, which estimated that 290,200 children worked unlawfully
last year, "is the most comprehensive view currently available."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has requested 800,000 dollars in its
budget for the fiscal year starting October 1 to measure the
extent of child labor abuses in agriculture. DeWine, on Thursday,
asked for a Labor Department report to determine the scope of
abuses in all sectors of the economy and to identify the most
hazardous of them.

<HEADLINE> Boeing: Fewer Jumbos, More Juveniles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Corporation, the
world's largest airplane maker, plans to produce 30 percent fewer
jumbo 747s, while making more new generation 737s airliners in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The decline of Asian market demand, which was dampened by the
serious economic crisis, is the main cause for the production cut
in 747s, said the company.
</P>
<P>
Boeing plans to produce five 747s a month in the first quarter
of 1999 and 3.5 a month in each of the following three quarters,
Fred Mitchell, the company's executive vice president of airplane
production said.
</P>
<P>
"The continued slow traffic growth in Asia has caused some
airlines to negotiate slides in deliveries of their next year's
747 orders, or to substitute other Boeing airplane models for
their existing 747 orders," Mitchell explained.
</P>
<P>
But production of new generation 737s would rise in the second
quarter of 1999 from 21 to 27 a month, responding to buoyant
market demand for this model.
</P>
<P>
In total, Boeing is still expected to have a growth in which
its turnout of jetliners will rise from 47, the current number, to
51, in the first month next year. This will be followed by 50.5 a
month in the second and third quarters and 48.5 a month by the
fourth quarter next year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sets Up Anti-terrorism Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has set up an
anti-terrorism center to ensure that the on-going tourism campaign
"Amazing Thailand 1997-1998" sail through smoothly, a government
news release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The center, designed to counter international terrorism, has
the status of a task force under the Supreme Command Headquarters
of the Thai Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Although it has its line of command, the center will only
start action by the order of the prime minister, said the release,
issued by the government Public Relations Department.
</P>
<P>
Concerned officers from various government agencies have
undergone intensive training courses, with the latest one being
held in Lopburi province, Central Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Commander General Mongkol Ampornpisit was quoted as
saying that the training course in Lopburi was aimed at ensuring
readiness to take swift action against all kinds of terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said the center was set up not just to protect the 13th
Asian Games scheduled for later this year but will continue to
exist until the end of next year to cope with possible terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was not possible to predict an act of
terrorism and that the best thing Thailand could do is to make
good preparations to cope with the situation, should it happens.
</P>
<P>
Thailand launched the "Amazing Thailand" tourism campaign late
last year in the hope of shoring up the economy battered by the
financial crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Anson Chan, chief secretary of
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Thursday urged
the United States to renew the Most Favored Nation (MFN) status
for China to help stabilize the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
At the Asia Society annual dinner in Washington, Chan also
indicated that Hong Kong's transition had gone "remarkably well"
and its success was due to the commitment of the Chinese central
government in honoring its promise.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's scrupulous observance of its hand-off policy towards
Hong Kong has been widely recognized both at home and abroad," she
told several hundred guests.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the U.S. could play an important part in
removing potential economic instability in Asia by renewing MFN
status for China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had decided early this month that
China be given the MFN status, which is normal trade relationship
between countries. The decision will take effect within 30 days
unless Congress votes against it in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers, using MFN status for China as a political tool,
oppose Clinton's decision.

"The year 2000 computer problem presents a serious economic
challenge for the Canadian economy. Businesses must act promptly
if they are going to meet that challenge," Martin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we are providing targeted tax relief to help ease
the financial constraints faced by small and medium-sized
businesses in addressing this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 problem is a design flaw in software applications
and in certain microprocessors related to storage of the year
designation that could play havoc when the calendar year changes
from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Many software applications such as accounting systems and
certain types of computer hardware could be affected.
</P>
<P>
Many Canadian firms have taken action to ensure that their
computer systems will be ready for the year 2000, but a large
number still have not addressed the problem.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Seeks Political Dialogue on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad
Jovanovic has reiterated that the Kosovo issue should only be
resolved through political dialogue within the Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency reported Thursday that Jovanovic called the
Kosovo crisis a terrorist act by Albanian splittists. Jovanovic
denied the existence of a massive cleansing of ethnic Albanians by
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the armed wing of the
Albanian independence movement, was a terrorist group which aimed
at disturbing the normal lives of Kosovo residents.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic stressed that the Yugoslav government would strive to
stop their malpractice, and the Yugoslav police would make efforts
to build a legal order in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that to avoid further conflicts and secure a peaceful
solution to the crisis, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
should continue dialogue with ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic also urged Albanian refugees to return home as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo escalated on March 1 when four policemen and
16 Albanians were killed in an armed battle. Since then, more than
250 people have died in clashes between government forces and the
KLA.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population,
have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Childcare Contributes to Longevity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers found that,
among humans and other advanced primates, the sex that provides
more childcare tends to live longer.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Allman, professor of biology at the California
Institute of Technology, and his colleagues analyzed survival data
for 10 primate species between male and female and looked at the
relationship between lifespan and parenting role.
</P>
<P>
They reported their findings in the latest issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
In species where mothers bear primary responsibility for
childcare -- among humans and gorillas, for example -- females
tend to have longer lifespans than males. But in species where
fathers do as much or more of the child-rearing -- such as owl
monkeys and titi monkeys -- males tend to live just as long or
longer than females.
</P>
<P>
"These results run counter to the reasonable expectation that
the increased energy expenditure and risk of falling associated
with carrying an infant would result in increased rather than
decreased mortality," the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
The bond between parent and child may play a role in parental
longevity, they suggested. "It is conceivable that the strength
of these bonds and their underlying neurochemical and hormonal
bases might enhance survival."

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Remain Largest Rice Exporter in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will remain the world's
largest rice exporter in the next 10 years, but more should be
done to improve the quality and production, rice experts in
Thailand said.
</P>
<P>
Experts expressed their concern Thursday at a seminar on the
future of Thai rice, organized by the Rice Research Institute of
the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
World demand for rice would increase annually through 2025 when
the world population is expected to expand by 1.4 billion, mostly
in Asia, the Bangkok Post Friday quoted Anand Dalodom,
director-general of the Agriculture Department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anand said annual rice production in the world would have to be
increased from 560 million tons at present to 840 million tons by
then.
</P>
<P>
Shipping out 19-21 million tons of paddy per year, Thailand
will remain the largest rice exporter for the next 10 years, but
the country must continuously improve its rice quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anand noted that of the 60 million rai (9.6 million hectare)
planting area in Thailand, only 20 million rai (3.2 million
hectare) are within irrigated areas, while the rest have to depend
on rain.
</P>
<P>
This is the main factor for the low yields of Thai rice farms,
which average at 300-400 kilograms per rai (0.16 hectare),
compared with an average 900-1,000 kilograms in Japan and South
Korea, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nibhon Wongtra-Ngarn, president of the Thai Rice
Mills Association, also suggested that Thailand should improve its
farm management, currently very poor, and designate rice-planting
zones.
</P>
<P>
He said the Agriculture Ministry should conduct regular surveys
of demand in the world market so that Thailand can improve the
quality of its rice to meet that demand.

COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police Thursday
arrested three gangsters including a leading arms dealer, a drug
baron and an underworld figure, The Island newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The police move followed the government's recent decision to
curb underworld activities in the country, the paper quoted police
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The arms dealer who is reported to be a supplier of weapons for
the underworld was arrested at Aluthgama in the south of the
country. On information supplied by him the other two were rounded
up. The drug dealer was arrested at Panadura, a suburb of Colombo,
and the underworld figure at Kirulapone in Colombo, police sources

But Odalovic said the clashes were the direct result of

Sanctions and the threat of international military action had

<HEADLINE> Chinese Grain Purchase Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
signed a decree to promulgate the "Regulations on the Purchase of
Grain."
</P>
<P>
The 23-article regulations govern the purchase of wheat, corn,
rice, and other grains designated by the State Council and by the
governments of various provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
They say that grain purchases are to be done in strict
accordance with state purchase and pricing policies. State ordered
grain prices are to be set as follows: when the market price of
grain is higher than the protective price, the price should be set
with reference to the market price, and when the market price is
lower than the protective price, it should not be lower than the
protective price.
</P>
<P>
State-owned grain companies should buy surplus grain from
farmers according to market prices. But if the market price falls
below the protective price, they should purchase grain at the
protective price.
</P>
<P>
If state-owned grain companies do not have grain storage
facilities or accounts at the Agriculture Bank of China, they will
not be allowed to purchase grain.
</P>
<P>
Financial departments should promptly allocate sufficient funds
to subsidize interest payments and fees for provincial grain
reserves.
</P>
<P>
State-owned grain companies should publish the purchasing price
and quality standards, and to pay sellers in cash immediately and
sell the grain at a price that will be slightly higher than the
cost.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government attaches great importance to improving
the grain distribution system. On a national televised conference
on June 3, Premier Zhu Rongji emphasized that all surplus grain
should be purchased at protective prices, that state-owned grain
enterprises must sell grain for a slight profit, and that grain
funds must be used properly.

<HEADLINE> Four-Way Talks on Unemployment in Southern Italy Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government opened here
Thursday consultations with the country's biggest trade union
confederations, employers and local authorities on ways to tackle
the thorny issue of unemployment in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
In an address to open the consultations, Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said the four-partite talks are intended to assess the
impact of government decisions already made and "identify the
limitations and procedural bottlenecks," the ANSA news agency
reported without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the talks are a large government delegation
led by Prodi, the biggest three trade union confederations of
CGIL, CISL and UIL, a delegation from the Confindustria employers
confederation as well as southern mayors and regional presidents.
</P>
<P>
Prodi proposed the formation of three working groups at the
national level.
</P>
<P>
One will be given the job of checking and monitoring the system
of incentives and facilitations. Another will analyze
bureaucratic procedures for authorizations and the third will
study the issues connected to illegal "black jobs" and socially
useful work schemes.
</P>
<P>
Southern Italy has the highest rate of unemployment in Italy,
with 2.8 million people, or 22 percent of the population in the
region, out of work. Nationally, the unemployment rate stands at
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to latest data released by Italy's National
Statistics Institute, the unemployment rate peaked at 25 percent
in the southernmost mainland region of Calabria in March.

U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, 65 million dollars
less than that at the end of 1997, Uruguay's Central Bank said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Cabinet Endorses Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian cabinet passed the 1999
draft national budget on Thursday and submitted it to the Supreme
Soviet of Ukraine (parliament) for ratification.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget limits the deficits for the national budget in
1999 to within two percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that the budget funds for 1999 will be
primarily spent to further boost domestic production, implement
structural reforms and ensure a rational use of national financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
The bill also highlights legislation on national taxation in a
bid to increase budget revenues. Priority considerations in budget
spending will be given to appropriations for national programs
capable of stimulating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, budget spending will also guarantee due payment of
wages to workers in the institutions and businesses covered by the
budget, and social security expenditures on residents.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget spending also covers Ukraine's obligation to
repay national debts in a full and due manner.
</P>
<P>
The budget for this year set a deficit of 3.3 percent of the
GDP. The country has been making efforts to reduce the deficit to
2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Armed Forces to Maintain Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Any action threatening political
and social stability in the reform process in Indonesia would not
be tolerated, local press Friday quoted The Armed Forces' (ABRI's)
Commander Wiranto as saying.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI's political stance toward the reform process is very
clear and firm. The reform process must be constitutional,
consistent, in the right direction, peaceful and orderly," Wiranto
said in his report to President B.J. Habibie during a ceremony at
the Presidential Palace here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that unruly demonstrations and protests in the
country would be crushed.
</P>
<P>
"The commotion of political activity, the various statements
and demonstrations, if they are allowed to continue, they can
disrupt stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Habibie also shared the view that
prolonged street demonstrations and the occupation of several
government offices could destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
"If this reform wave becomes uncontrollable and violates the
foundations which unite our very pluralistic nation, it could be
possible that our nation will become divided and weak," the
President said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to face a national disintegration as
experienced by other nations," Habibie added.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, the first official meeting between the President
and ABRI's Commander since Habibie replaced Soeharto last month,
was attended by 151 senior officers from the rank of colonel to
four-star general.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after the ceremony, Wiranto reaffirmed
that ABRI had supported the constitutional government under
President Habibie since the beginning of the new administration.
</P>
<P>
He urged the nation to give the current government an
opportunity to settle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The nation needs political stability and a conducive
environment to get out of the crisis," he added.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Textile Workers Creating New Jobs For Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Textile workers in the city of
Suzhou, in east China's Jiangsu Province, who were laid off, have
created new jobs for themselves by using the old facilities of
bankrupt companies to set up entirely new ventures.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the local government, unemployed textile
workers in the city have set up five self-help enterprises, which
provide more than 200 jobs as well as 10,000 yuan in income
annually for each worker.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Textile Re-employment Center rented several
workshops from the Suzhou Towel Factory, spent 80,000 yuan, and
brought in four technicians, creating the first enterprise
for the city's unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
The new company produces toys that are proving very popular in
the United States and Europe, and it employs 50 people who were
laid-off. Its annual production is worth 12 million yuan and it
has profits of 800,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed textile workers have also set up a garment
factory, a knitting mill, and other enterprises, creating not only
new jobs but also a lot more money for themselves.

<HEADLINE> Truck Sales Plunge in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Trucks sold by the Philippines'
assemblers in May 1998 dropped by 53.2 percent to just 3,340 units
from the year-ago level of 7,146 units due to the lingering
effects of the Asian financial crisis, according to an industry
report.
</P>
<P>
In the report published Friday, the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. (Campi) said last month's
commercial vehicle or truck sales brought to just 6,291 units the
number of vehicles, including cars, sold in May.
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicles sold last month represented a 54.2
percent drop when compared to the 13,749 vehicles sold for the
corresponding month last year.
</P>
<P>
Campi officials identified four reasons for the auto sales
slump -- high interest rates, increased prices, increased down
payment requirements and banks' reluctance to increase auto loans.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi emerged as the country's top commercial vehicle
brand, but truck sales of Mitsubishi Motors Phils. Corp. for May
dropped 36.7 percent to just 919 units from 1,452 for the
corresponding month last year.

<HEADLINE> Study: Most U.S. Community Playgrounds Lack Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A study released Thursday
indicates that most U.S. community playgrounds lack safety, which
result in hundreds of thousands of injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
The study, released by the Consumer Federation of America and
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, found that nine out of
ten playgrounds surveyed had inadequate protective surfaces.
</P>
<P>
The results came from a nationwide survey of 760 playgrounds in
24 states.
</P>
<P>
"Kids are going to scrape their knees, try risk-taking
behavior," said Mary Ellen Fise, Product safety director of the
Consumer Federation of American, adding that one reason behind the
problem is that "playground equipment is not cheap.'
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 150,000 children sustain playground injuries
that require trips to hospitals. About 15 children die.
</P>
<P>
The study, done every two years since 1992, recommended a
number of guidelines for improvement of playground safety,
including protective surfaces and climbing equipment with top rung
or platform.

<HEADLINE> China's No.1 Arts, Crafts Workshop to Reopen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Arts and Craft World,
considered the No.1 arts and crafts workshop in China, is expected
to re-open at its original site on the bustling Wangfujing Street
in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was closed three years ago for renovation and
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Its predecessor was the Beijing Arts and Crafts Service Center,
which opened in 1954.
</P>
<P>
For a long period of time, the workshop served as the only
supplier of gifts of top Party and state leaders for overseas
visits.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, with the support of the government, the
workshop shouldered the task of reviving the dying traditional
Chinese artworks through providing funds and management personnel,
and collecting and purchasing related artworks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the art of making famous products such as pottery
and porcelain products made at Jingdezhen, in east China's Jiangxi
Province, and red-brown pottery pots made in Yixing, in east China's
Jiangsu Province, were saved and put into batch production.
</P>
<P>
This art shop organized exhibitions of artworks in nine Eastern
European countries, thus opening the doors for the export of
Chinese artworks.
</P>
<P>
Artworks the shops sells cover 70 categories in nearly 20,000
varieties, such as pearls, jewels and jade ware, facial makeup,
clay figurines, the four treasures of the study (writing brush,
inkstick, inkslab and paper), papercuts and applique.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the earthquake which hit Tangshan in north China's
Hebei Province, in 1976, the art shop's building was listed as a
"dangerous building".
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the Beijing Arts and Crafts Group began
rebuilding the shop, with an investment of 300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the group's general manager, Wang Zhen, the
newly-completed 32,000-sq-m Beijing Arts and Crafts World,
which occupies 13 floors, is expected to be a center for shopping,
catering, entertainment and handling official business.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Historical Trend on Healthy Growth of Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin had
a successful state visit to the United States last fall, marking
the advent of a new era in Sino-U.S. relations. Amidst the sound
and stable growth of Sino-U.S. relations, the U.S. House of
Representatives, disregarding the consistent stance of the Chinese
government and the commitment by every U.S. administration after
1972, approved a motion last Tuesday in which it required
President Bill Clinton during his upcoming China visit to impose
pressure on the country and force it to abandon non-peaceful means
for the liberation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is not only a bold move which interferes in China's
internal affairs but also sets barriers against further developing
the improved Sino-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that the Taiwan issue, the most
important and sensitive problem in Sino-U.S. relations, will be
an unavoidable topic during the Sino-U.S. summit between Jiang
and Clinton due later this month.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Sino-U.S. Joint Statement signed by the two heads
of state at the previous Washington summit has already
demonstrated the basic stance of the two governments in this
regard. The Chinese side in the statement underlined that the key
to healthy and stable Sino-U.S. ties is to properly handle the
Taiwan issue in accordance with the three joint communiques signed
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The American side reiterated that the U.S. side adheres to "One
China" stand and observes the three communiques. President Clinton
and the U.S. government also clearly elaborated that the United
States did not support "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan",
nor the independence of Taiwan, or Taiwan's entry into the United
Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government has repeatedly announced its willingness
to reunify the country by peaceful means, but cannot undertake not
to use armed means to resolve the Taiwan issue. The stance of the
Chinese government in this regard is targeted at foreign
interference and so-called "Taiwan independence" instead of the
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
It is the set guideline for reunifying China by peaceful
means. However, every sovereign state has the right to take all
means it deems essential, including military means, to safeguard
its national sovereignty and territorial integration. On how to
handle its internal affairs, the Chinese government is not obliged
to make any commitment to any foreign country or any party,
especially those aiming to split China.
</P>
<P>
Many far-sighted people in the U.S. hold that Sino-US relations
would be stalled, and even see some setbacks if the Taiwan issue
is beset with troubles. Such a move is itself not in the realistic
and long-term interests of the U.S. They suggest that the U.S. look
squarely at China's position on the Taiwan question, effectively
observe the Sino-U.S. joint communiques and Sino-US Joint
Statement as well as the commitment made by the U.S. government,
so as to maintain the good momentum of development in Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
Only by dispelling all interference and uproar in Sino-US
relations can statesmen in both countries stand higher and see
farther in dealing with Sino-US relations, as a reformer in
China's Song Dynasty said in a poem: "Unafraid of floating clouds
blocking the view, because you stand at the pinnacle." And only by
grasping the fundamental interests of the people of both countries
and having an overall world situation in mind can a prosperous,
stable and peaceful world be properly brought into the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Sole Tropical Rain Forest Near Tropic of Cancer Under Protection (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tropical rain forest accounts for eight percent of the total
area of the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The government has made great efforts to build the nature
reserve and offered a guarantee for the effective survival of the
tropical rain forest," said Li Hongwei, who is also an engineer with
the Yunnan Provincial Design Institute of Forestry Survey and
Planning.
</P>
<P>
The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land
in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, he said, and after nearly
four decades it has grown to more than 240,000 ha and contains
most of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve is divided into a core area and an
experimental area. The core area is exclusively for farming
activities, while the scale of farmland is under strict control
in the experimental area. Hunting is banned in all areas of the
nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop farmers from cutting trees for residential
buildings and fuel use, the local government has designated a
commercial forest area beyond the nature reserve, and executes
planned felling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the use of new building materials relieves the
burden on the nature reserve. The traditional bamboo houses in
which the local people live are being replaced by brick and cement
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The local government is now carrying out a resettlement
program, gradually removing itinerant farmers from the rain
forest. In 1997 the government spent more than four million yuan
(about 480,000 US dollars) building new villages for over 3,000
farmers of the Yao and Hani minority nationalities who had moved
from the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian prince, when visiting Xishuangbanna, insisted on
taking a look at the tropical rain forest. When he saw the
thriving trees there, he said that he had seen an example of
successful protection of nature.

<HEADLINE> Sole Tropical Rain Forest Near Tropic of Cancer under Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Xishuangbanna
Nature Reserve, which mainly features protection of a tropical
rain forest, has been enlarged to 247,000 ha from 242,000 ha in the
past 15 years, according to a recent survey by the UN Global
Environment Facility.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongwei, chief of the UN survey program, said that this
indicates that "China has worked hard to protect the sole tropical
rain forest near the Tropic of Cancer by establishing a nature
reserve."
</P>
<P>
The tropical rain forest, located in the Xishuangbanna Dai
Autonomous Prefecture and the adjacent areas in southwestern
Yunnan Province, is the sole tropical rain forest left near the
Tropic of Cancer, and it is also the one at the highest latitude
on earth. Other areas on the same latitude are mostly
desertified.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Han Xingguo, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, attributed the survival of the tropical rain forest in
Xishuangbanna to its unique geographical location.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayas, which acts as a natural protective screen,
hinder the invasion of cold air, while warm, moist air from the
Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain for the forest, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna has at least 4,900 species of higher plants,
including 58 rare and endangered ones that have been put under
state protection. It is also home to a quarter of the species of
mammals and a third of species of birds in China.

<HEADLINE> China to Guarantee Fertilizer Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to introduce a new
fertilizer distribution system soon to increase producers' profits
and guarantee supplies for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, fertilizer manufacturers will have the
rights to market and sell their products directly to consumers,
rather than acting solely as producers, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, agricultural products companies in charge
of buying fertilizer from producers and selling it to farmers have
played a leading role in fertilizer distribution.
</P>
<P>
More often than not, fertilizer producers have no access to
end-users, resulting in a slow response to the volatile market and
a failure to implement proper pricing strategies.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, fertilizer production
stood at 8.49 million tons, down 5.9 percent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline in production was primarily caused by sagging
sales, the Beijing-based daily said.
</P>
<P>
High inventory resulting from mounting imports of fertilizer in
the past three consecutive years and a fall in grain prices were
the major culprits behind the production slump.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that next year will see a good season for
fertilizer sales.

CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- A slump in the labor market and hikes Thursday in fixed-term
housing rates delivered a sharp setback to the federal
government's election pitch, but Prime Minister John Howard
declared himself committed to an early double dissolution
election.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Howard refused to be shaken Thursday by a
resurgent One Nation Party or the prospect of tougher economic
conditions, declaring that his major goal remained to drive his
native title legislation through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's tourism industry will not begin to recover from
the effects of the Asian economic crisis until 1999, according to
figures released Thursday by federal tourism minister Andrew
Thomson. The Tourism Forecasting Council expects an 8 percent
decline in visitor arrivals this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian shares plunged Thursday for the eighth
consecutive day, taking to 52 billion Australian dollars (30.68
billion U.S. dollars) the total value wiped off the market since
its mid-April peak and throwing many planned floats into jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Producing Biodegradable Plastic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
begun to produce a type of biodegradable plastic sheet that can
help solve the "white pollution" problem and better protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The plastic sheet, developed by Professor Qian Jun of Hefei
United University after ten years of research, doesn't harm the
environment and it can be used to protect crops from viruses.
</P>
<P>
China has long had a problem with "white pollution", the
wide-spread use of styrofoam containers, because they don't
decompose in the environment easily.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui provincial government announced that the first-phase
of a project to produce 30,000 tons of this decomposable plastic
material was completed in the city of Huaibei recently.
</P>
<P>
The environment-friendly plastic has extensive applications to
agriculture, industry, and daily-use items.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pele, considered the best
soccer football player of the century, said that the first match
of the Brazilian team against Scotland did not satisfy him and
said that the selection was not at its best.
</P>
<P>
Brazil defeated Scotland 2-1 in the inaugural game of the
France 98 Soccer World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Pele commented that the selection of his country did not play
well, despite an improvement in the second half of the match, with
the change of Leonardo instead of Giovani, middlefielder.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the victory is good and that it is
necessary for the Brazilian selection to correct its mistakes for
the next match with the Morocco selection next June 16.
</P>
<P>
Edson Arantes DO Nascimento "Pele" said that it was a mistake
of trainer Zagallo not to consider forward Edmundo for the
inaugural game. According to Pele, Edmundo would have been a good
choice to defeat the Scotish persecution.
</P>
<P>
Pele is a commentarist with the Brazilian TV network Globo
during the France 98 World Cup.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Surges to Eight-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged more than
2.3 yen to approach an eight-year high against the Japanese
currency in a broad rally Thursday, being stimulated by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's comments on the yen's weakness.
</P>
<P>
Traders interpreted Rubin's remarks as a sign there would be no
coordinated international action to support the yen.
</P>
<P>
In its advance, the dollar climbed to a record against the
Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso while jumping against the
German mark.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended at 143.79 yen in late New York trading, up
from 141.43 yen Wednesday. At one point during the trading, the
dollar rose to 143.97 yen, a level never seen since September 4,
1990.
</P>
<P>
For the past few weeks, the dollar has pushed past several
seven-year highs against yen, but didn't trade higher because of
fears of intervention.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was changing hands at 1.8087 marks in New York,
up from 1.7962 Wednesday. During trading, it hit 1.8095 marks, a
level last seen in late April.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar fell below 68 U.S. cents for the first time
in its 140-year history, dropping as low was 67.98 cents before
settling in New York at even 68 cents, down from 68.22 cents
Wednesday. The previous low of 68.10 cents was reached in January.
</P>
<P>
Canada's economy has suffered because of the plight of Asia,
one of its major markets for coal, lumber and minerals.
</P>
<P>
The peso's fall was accompanied by a 2.4 percent drop in
Mexico's key stock index.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4965 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870; 6.0675 French
francs, up from 6.0220; and 1,781.00 Italian lire, up from
1,768.00.
</P>

The British pound fell to 1.6273 U.S. dollars from 1.6289 U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Armenia to Improve Yerevan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday
approved an interest-free credit of equivalent to 30 million U.S.
dollars to Armenia for a Municipal Development Project to help
improve water supply in Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to improve the management and delivery of
water and wastewater services for the Yerevan area, while laying
the groundwork for the involvement of the private sector in these
services.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional lending wing for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since Armenia joined the World Bank in 1992, and IDA in 1993,
IDA commitments to the country have totalled some 384.8 million
dollars for 16 projects.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Disarmament Hears Joint Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament heard
Thursday a joint declaration by the foreign ministers of eight
countries on nuclear disarmament after the nuclear tests conducted
by India and Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
In the joint declaration issued on June 9, the foreign
ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand,
Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden suggested that the
nuclear-weapon states should immediately abandon present
hair-trigger postures by proceeding to deactivating their nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
They said that non-strategic nuclear weapons should also be
removed from deployed sites. They believed that such measures
would create beneficial conditions for continued disarmament
efforts and help prevent inadvertent, accidental or unauthorized
launches.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament had debated in length the recent
nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers said the continued threat to humanity
represented by the perspective of the indefinite possession of
nuclear weapons had been further underscored by the nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the three nuclear-weapon-capable states,
India, Israel and Pakistan, must also clearly and urgently reverse
the pursuit of their respective nuclear weapons development or
deployment and refrain from any actions which could undermine the
efforts of the international community on nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament resumes its plenary on June 18.

<HEADLINE> PC Makers Try to Slip Grasp of Intel, Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Major personal computer makers of
the United States are announcing a series of moves showing their
wills of independence of the control of Intel or Microsoft, the
two PC giants in the world.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today reported Thursday that half of the 10 major PC
makers now use lower-cost chips from Intel rivals in some PCs,
as a way to stay outside of Intel's stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Compaq, the biggest PC maker, said this week that it will sell
home PCs this fall that have four keyboard buttons to quickly take
users to Internet portal sites, such as Yahoo, on-line stores,
search services and electronic mail -- bypassing Microsoft's
control of the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard has already offered new keyboards with such
buttons.
</P>
<P>
Packard Bell-NEC announced it will offer PCs that have screen
icons, placed outside Microsoft's Windows desktop screen and
thus outside of Microsoft's control, that link users to Internet
sites, including on-line stores.
</P>
<P>
Gateway recently won Microsoft'a approval to direct customers
to Gateway's Internet service provider (ISP) as opposed to those
sanctioned by Microsoft. That means more revenue for Gateway,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Dell Computer expects to tout its own group of ISPs in
upcoming PCs, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts by the PC makers are designed to offset
declining PC prices, slowing growth and shrinking margins, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that of vital importance to PC makers is finding
a way to cash in on the growth of the digital economy -- the
buying of goods and services over the Internet. That is
projected to be a 300 billion U.S. dollar market by 2002 as the
number of Net transactions doubles every 100 days.
</P>
<P>
So far, PC makers have done little more than supply the PC
boxes consumers use to access the digital economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personages Call for Enhancing U.S.-China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States and China
need enhanced cooperation and relations, stressed a number of
American personages prior to U.S. President Bill Clinton's state
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
They criticized some remarks meant to obstruct the development
of U.S.-China ties and block Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
They disagreed with some anti-China groups, who want to block
the development of the bilateral relations, by using such issues
as human rights, trade, technology and the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China have made progress in improving
their relationship, although the progress comes hard and slowly,
but it does come, and both countries have to keep working at it,
said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, a Democrat from Indiana, in a
recent Xinhua interview.
</P>
<P>
"President Bill Clinton's visit to China is very important. I
think we are seeking to place the U.S.-China relationship on a
more normal basis, a more solid footing," said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
On MFN status for China, the Representative said it will
eventually be approved but it will go through a "rocky process,
a difficult process."
</P>
<P>
The MFN is a very important symbol of the U.S.-China relationship,
he said. "If we were to defeat the MFN treatment to China, it
would send a huge signal of deterioration of the U.S.-China
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the MFN debate every year, I think it
exacerbates, it makes more difficult the U.S.-China relationship.
I wish we could get rid of the debate," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
But in the process there is a lot of anti-China rhetoric that
makes the management of the relationship more difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the rhetoric in Congress about China as "very
confusing," Hamilton said, "I think a lot of it has to be
understood in terms of American politics. There are lot of people
who oppose President Clinton and they are using the China policy
as a means of attacking him politically and attacking the
Democratic Party, even though the president's policy is the policy
of engagement which was originally established by President Nixon
and has been carried out by every president, Republican and
Democrat since the opening to China in the early 1970s," Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey E. Garten, Dean of the Yale School of Management,
pointed out in an article in the latest issue of the Business Week
that it would be a shame if the frenzy over satellite in Congress
undercut or even forced the postponement of President Clinton's
summit, the best opportunity in a decade to build constructive
ties between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Since last October, when China's President Jiang Zemin came to
Washington, the Administration has emphasized expanding American
business dealings with China, he said. "It has attempted to keep
any one issue from throwing the U.S.-China relationship off
course."
</P>
<P>
"It has tried to cultivate China as a partner rather than make
it feel like the enemy. These were exactly the right goals," he
added.
</P>
<P>
For its part, he noted, China has acted responsibly in
putting Asia's -- and America's -- economic interests above its
own in not devaluing the Renminbi, and help defuse the threat of
nuclear war between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the lack of understanding about the fundamentals
of the bilateral relationship, and too much uninformed rhetoric,
Brent Scowcroft, former U.S. Presidential National Security
Advisor, said, "More than 25 years after the signing of the
Shanghai Communique, I doubt that half of the Members of the U.S.
Congress can explain the document."
</P>
<P>
On the alleged missile technology transfer to China, Robert A.
Kapp, President of the U.S.-China Business Council, said, "I find
the whole thing regrettable and we, as business community, are
very concerned about the casual acceptance of the allegations as
the facts."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope Clinton's China visit would help increase
mutual understanding.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges 160 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
sank nearly 160 points Thursday as a soaring dollar compounded
concerns about the impact of the Asian financial crisis on U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow plunged 159.93 to 8,811.77, and has now lost more than
250 points in three sessions, essentially wiping out the sharp
gain of the three sessions before that.
</P>
<P>
Broader indexes also dropped despite a strong bond market,
where interest rates fell to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign exchange market here, the U.S. dollar soared to
its highest level against the Japanese yen since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The dollar surged after Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
speaking before a Senate committee, appeared to rule out a U.S.
role in supporting the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
The Dow now sits 400 points below May 13's record close of
9,211.84, but still holds a gain of 900 points, or more than 11
percent, for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 17.70 to 1,094.58, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 23.50 to 1,749.75.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 734.78 million
shares, slightly above Wednesday's tally of 733.36 million.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 8.87 to 565.50, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.80 to 699.05.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's UN Ambassador on His Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has made the
decision on moratorium on nuclear testing because it remains
committed to the concept of the nuclear disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation in South Asia, Ahmad Kamal, Pakistan's
Ambassador to the United Nations said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kamal was responding to the announcement made by the Government
of Pakistan this morning on a unilateral moratorium on nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said Pakistan has invited U.N. Secretary-General to visit
Pakistan, and hopefully to visit India also, because Pakistan
believes that the matter of the tension in South Asia and the
nuclearization of South Asia are matters of primary importance.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said since it is the duty of the
Secretary-General to enter the matters to the Security Council and
to remove the threat to peace and security, it is absolutely
necessary for him to engage and to involve personally
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the Secretary-General has decided that he wants
initially to send a personal envoy to South Asia, and
Pakistan welcomes the move and hopes that the envoy will come
urgently as early as the beginning of the next week.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador expressed the hope the visit by the envoy will
pave the way for the visit by the Secretary-General himself
and defuse the tension in South Asia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Mexico's Prosecuting U.S. Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday that prosecution of U.S. agents
accused of violating Mexican law in an anti-drug sting operation
in Mexico would be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Albright said that Washington
will cooperate "as possible," but said prosecution and extradition
of American agents would be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Albright's comments raised the possibility of a conflict with
Mexican authorities, which is preparing to accuse the U.S. agents
of a series of violations while in Mexico carrying out "Operation
Casablanca."
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government reacted angrily after learning that the
presence of U.S. undercover agents had been concealed from Mexican
officials.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the news conference, Mexican Foreign Secretary
Rosario Green noted that both governments were taking steps to
improve cooperation and communication on drug enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Operation Casablanca, Green said, "The
investigation has to be pursued according to law."
</P>
<P>
Following the two days of meetings, Albright and Green decided
to install hotlines to facilitate instant communication between
them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright said that the two countries' justice
departments would begin talks soon on enhancing law enforcement
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Green criticized American behavior. "In the
absence of communication, cooperation, trust, respect and will,
our relationship runs the risk of heading down the wrong path," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Showcase Its Millennium Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
launched a touring exhibition of twelve millennium building to
show the rest of the world how the UK is preparing for the new
century.
</P>
<P>
The "12 for 2000 - Building for the Millennium" exhibition,
which will be taken around the world before the year 2000, "is a
reflection of the UK on the verge of the 21st century", said Chris
Smith, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
</P>
<P>
Under the headline themes of regeneration, environment and
people, the exhibition includes computer animation, video,
photography, CD-ROM, plans and drawings.
</P>
<P>
Chris Smith, also the chairman of the UK Millennium Commission,
which was set up to assist the communities in celebrating the
start of the new millennium, added that the twelve building are
only a sample of the hundreds of projects being developed across
the UK.
</P>
<P>
No other country in the world is investing as much as the UK to
mark the new millennium. The Millennium Commission is planning to
make 2 billion pounds (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) available to
support projects in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland,
according to Chris Smith.

<HEADLINE> Cook Says Britain Opposes Kosovo Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Thursday told leader of Kosovo Albanians Ibrahim Rugova that
Britain supported peaceful solution of the current Kosovo crisis,
but was against Kosovo independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Rugova, Cook said that the
British government was determined to halt the worsening crisis in
Kosovo at a meeting of the six-nation Contact Group foreign
ministers in London Friday.
</P>
<P>
"President (Slobodan) Milosevic is now on his last warning. He
would be making a heavy mistake if he imagined the international
community will be as slow to respond as it was during the
unfolding tragedy in Bosnia," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook also made it clear that the international community was
totally opposed to gaining total independence by ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely true the position of the Contact Group and
the international community is to support enhanced autonomy for
Kosovo, not independence," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the Kosovo Liberation Army can liberate
their people. The risk is that they will only prolong the
suffering of their people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair also held
brief talks with Rugova and promised Britain would do its best to
help resolve the Kosovo crisis peacefully.

ATHENS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek teachers Thursday clashed
with riot police when they tried to occupy the examination centers
around the country in a bid to stop their colleagues from taking
part in the test for new appointments to state schools.
</P>
<P>
Despite police being stationed at all the 32 centers,
protesting teachers have managed to take over the centers in
Athens, Thessaloniki, Pyrgos, Agrinio, Kozani and Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
In the Athens suburb of Pefki, one policeman was slightly
injured and two teachers were arrested when about 70 teachers
tried to break through a police guard.
</P>
<P>
In Patissia, four teachers were arrested and some vehicles
parked in the area were damaged when teachers used sticks and
stones to break through another school acting as examination
center. Riot police dispersed them by firing tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Greek teachers began Thursday a two-day nationwide strike to
protest the government's new hiring examination system.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Water Scarcity Constraints Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The scarcity of water,
especially in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, is one
of world's top environmental challenges, a release from the
United Nations said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The release said a third of the world's population lives in
areas where lack of water limits development, and in 20 years,
two-thirds of the world's population will live in areas where
development is constrained because of water scarcity.
</P>
<P>
The release said lack of water can also lead to conflict over
resources and has adverse health consequences on populations.
</P>
<P>
It showed that there has been a six-fold increase in water
consumption globally this century, largely due to agricultural and
industrial activity.
</P>
<P>
It also revealed that 12 million hectares of forests are lost
every year and that 60 percent of the world's coral reefs are at
risk due to pollution and coastal development, especially in
Southeast Asia and in the Indian Ocean.

<HEADLINE> UK's Two Parties Join Hands in Pushing Constitution Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
signed on Thursday a joint declaration on constitutional reform
with Britain's third party, the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The two-page declaration, signed by Blair and Liberal
Democratic Party leader Paddy Ashdown, committed both parties to
end the voting rights of hereditary peers in the House of Lords as
"the first stage in a process to create a modern second chamber".
</P>
<P>
"The Government and the Liberal Democrats will not necessarily
agree on every aspect of these and future constitutional reforms.
But we are at one on the elements of change, the vital necessity
of them, and the importance of the partnership we have created to
bring them about," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats, who have 46 seats in the House of
Commons, are the most radical of Britain's three main parties on
reforming the constitution and have a long-standing commitment to
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Senior Liberal Democrats told reporters the declaration made it
certain there would be more constitutional changes before and
after the next election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Labor Party and the Liberal Democrats have worked
together last year to bring in devolved parliaments for Scotland
and Wales -- changes opposed by the opposition Conservative Party.
