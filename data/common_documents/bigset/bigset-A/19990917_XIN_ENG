<HEADLINE> UNICEF Mounts Timor Relief Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The grave situation in
East and West Timor has put hundreds of thousands of children and
women in immediate peril, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 500,000 people have been displaced from their homes
and are now facing severe nutritional and health risks. Some
75,000 are estimated to be under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF is presently responding to the refugee crisis in
West Timor, and is now preparing for a significantly expanded
presence there, supportedly by a staging center in Darwin,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF is also assembling a recovery plan for East Timor,
to be implemented as soon as staff are able to return. The
children's agency is coordinating its work with other involved
United Nations partners.
</P>
<P>
"The refugee crisis has exacerbated what had already been poor
health and sanitation conditions for the people of Timor," UNICEF
Executive Director Carol Bellamy said. "In addition to tremendous
displacements, there have been several reported massacres,
including severe violence to women and children with thousands of
them hiding in the hills of East Timor, are desperate for food and
shelter."
</P>
<P>
Water and sanitation conditions have suffered major
deterioration, Bellamy said, and massive health risks for children
and women are developing in overcrowded West Timor camps.
</P>
<P>
Diarrhoea and malaria pose particular dangers, the agency chief
said, adding that also family separation, disruption of education,
and the trauma of witnessing atrocities are expected to have
long-term impact, especially on children.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has already helped to address initial emergency
needs in the West Timor camps. Based on an assessment carried out
by UNICEF staff working in Kupang and Atambua, both in West Timor,
the UNICEF is distributing 12.5 tons of nutritional supplements to
children in the West Timor camps, which are capable of serving
25,000 children for seven to nine days, providing 10,000 thousand
blankets for U.N. airdrops over East Timor, providing drugs and
medical supplies to help meet the needs of women and children.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the UNICEF emergency relief program for East
and West Timor is now estimated at 5 million U.S. dollars,
covering activities in water and sanitation, health, nutrition,
education and psychosocial services, Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has been operating in both East and West Timor for
18 years. The agency was forced to evacuate East Timor in
September, Bellamy said, adding that the UNICEF warehouse in Dili,
capital of East Timor, was sacked last week and 7.5 tons of food
and other supplies were burned.

<P>
GENEVA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever International
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Intellectual Property World,
hosted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO),
ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to some 700 delegates from WIPO members and the
e-commerce industry at the end of the three-day meeting, WIPO
Director-General Kamil Idris called for broader participation of
developing countries in the electronic commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that through the use of WIPO net and other means,
developing countries could have access to IP information,
participate in global policy formulation, and gain opportunities
to use IP in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
On domain disputes, the WIPO chief expressed the hope that the
recommendations of the Report of the WIPO Domain Name Process
would be implemented in the pursuit of compatibility between
identifiers in the real and virtual worlds through the
establishment of rules for mutual respect and the elimination of
contradictions between the domain name system and intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Idris called for the establishment of
appropriate principles at the international level for determining
the circumstances of intellectual property liability of Online
Service Providers which are compatible and workable within a
framework of general liability rules for OSPs.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed other intellectual property-related issues
like online administration of IP disputes, online applications for
trade marks and patent protection, and Internet safety and digital
assets management.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Destroying Village Related to Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi archaeologist on
Thursday refuted allegations made by the United States that Iraq
has destroyed a whole village connected with opposition groups in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Muayad Saeed, also an advisor in the ministry of
information and culture, told a press conference that what
U.S. officials called a village is an archaeological site in the
northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was made by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Martin Indyk in a press conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Saeed said the village is located on the ruins of an
ancient city dating back to the Asserian era (2,600 B.C.), where
Iraqi archaeologists found cuneiform inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
He said the antiquities authorities have compensated the
villagers who have moved out of the village since 1985 to live in
the city center of Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. made such allegation in order to create
pretexts to continue its savage aggressions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Saeed invited foreign journalists to visit the village to
see it by themselves.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Debates on Measures for Protecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Thursday held open debate on the measures
proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for protecting
civilians in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Annan presented to the Security Council a
report in which he said that despite the adoption over the 50
years of the main conventions of International Humanitarian and
Human Rights Law, "hardly a day goes by where we are not presented
with evidence of the intimidation, brutalization, torture and
killing of helpless civilians in situations of armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said the United Nations is the only
international organization with the reach and authority to address
this issue. Thus, the U.N. chief made recommendations to the
Council for its consideration. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- Take steps to strengthen the organization's capacity to plan
and deploy rapidly,
</P>
<P>
-- Establish a permanent technical review mechanism of United
Nations and regional sanctions to ascertain the probable impact of
sanctions on civilians,
</P>
<P>
-- Impose arms embargoes in situations where civilians and
protected persons are targeted by the parties to the conflict and
urge Member States to enforce these embargoes in their own
national jurisdictions,
</P>
<P>
-- Consider deployment in certain cases of a preventive
peacekeeping operation, or of another preventive monitoring
presence,
</P>
<P>
-- Make greater use of targeted sanctions to deter and contain
those who commit egregious violations of international
humanitarian and human rights law, as well as those parties to
conflicts which continually defy the resolutions of the Council,
</P>
<P>
-- Deploy international military observers to monitor the
situation in camps for internally displaced persons and refugees,
</P>
<P>
-- Underscore in its resolutions the imperative for civilian
populations to have unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance,
and insist that failure to comply will result in the imposition of
targeted sanctions,
</P>
<P>
-- Ensure that whenever required, peacekeeping and peace
enforcement operations are authorized and equipped to control or
close down hate media assets,
</P>
<P>
-- In the face of massive and ongoing abuses, consider the
imposition of appropriate enforcement action.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Denies Talks with Somali Faction Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia denied reports
that its Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin held any talks with Somali
faction leaders in Tripoli, Libya, this week.
</P>
<P>
The Government Spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday
that the reported meeting never occurred.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added that Somali faction leaders,
including Hussein Aidid, are welcome to come to Addis Ababa for
talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention the possible topics about the
Ethiopia- proposed talks.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, there were reports that Aidid's militiamen
at Quoriole have been annihilated by Ethiopian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Ethiopian troops have moved deep into
Somalia, as far as Hissa Town, only 70 kilometers away from the
capital city Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Some Somali faction leaders opposed to Aidid have held
consultations recently in Addis Ababa under the cover of a peace
conference, local press Rait said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Italy to Improve Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Italy agreed on
Thursday to establish permanent consultation mechanisms to improve
bilateral cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference here Thursday afternoon, Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his visiting Italian counterpart
Lamberto Dini expressed determination to leave behind the crisis
over the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The PKK led by Ocalan has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
"There were some difficulties in the past which we are in a
process of overcoming," said Cem, referring to the strained ties
caused by Ocalan's periodical stay in Rome early this year.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan tried in vain to gain asylum in Italy and was captured
by Turkish special agents in Kenya last February. He was sentenced
to death by a Turkish court.
</P>
<P>
"We reached mutual understanding to reactivate and further
develop our relations," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Dini, who arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day
official visit, stated that "a new phase is being opened up" in
the ties between Italy and Turkey and expressed determination "to
give impetus to political relations in particular."
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to set up bilateral committees that will
meet regularly and discuss issues concerning bilateral and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The committees will deal with measures to improve bilateral
political, cultural and economic ties as well as international
matters.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources said that during the talks, the
Italian side agreed to work with Turkey on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Turkey and Italy also
agreed to meet once a year. Cem will pay a return visit to Italy
in the fall next year.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Vows to Put Forward Austerity Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder told lawmakers in a heated debate over his new fiscal
reform draft in Berlin Thursday that he would pursue the austerity
policy with "courage and determination."
</P>
<P>
The unwelcome package was "just what Germany bitterly needs
now," Schroeder said while lashing out at the opposition who
called the plan a "hoodwink."
</P>
<P>
His center-left coalition government inherited a state debt as
high as 1.5 trillion marks (800 million U.S. dollars) from his
predecessor Helmut Kohl, Schroeder said at Berlin's Reichstag
building. More than 600 members of the Bundestag, the lower
chamber of the German parliament, are holding days of debate over
the package before voting.
</P>
<P>
"We are paying 82 billion marks a year just for the interest on
this sum," he said, accusing the then ruling Christian Democrats
(CDU) of bringing the country "to the edge of immobilization."
</P>
<P>
Now, before any political priority can be established, he must
at first "step by step" cut the state debt with the reform
package, Schroeder stressed, adding: "We are on the right path,
also for cutting the jobless rate."
</P>
<P>
The austerity plan, drafted by Finance Minister Hans Eichel and
supported by Schroeder, will cut Germany's state budget by 30
billion marks in the year 2000 and more in following years if it
is passed in parliament. Spending on the government, the public
health and other social welfare issues will be drastically reduced
while tax rates will be lowered under the plan.
</P>
<P>
Since it came onto table in this June, the package has pulled
Schroeder into a multi-front war. Both the left-wingers in his
Social Democratic Party (SPD), the powerful labor unions, and the
conservative CDU have disavowed Schroeder's policy.
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists in the SPD and the labor unions said Schroeder,
betraying the party's ideal of "social justice," would hurt the
interests of the weak. Dozens of SPD members, including
high-ranking party leaders, have announced they will vote against
the austerity package.
</P>
<P>
And plain Germans, living decades under one of the world's most
perfect social welfare systems, are worried about their future.
Many have voted against Schroeder's SPD in recent regional
elections.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, the SPD was defeated by the CDU in state
elections in Thuringia and Saarland, lost sole control of
Brandenburg state, and lost majority in municipal elections in
North Rhine-Westphalia state. Analysts say Schroeder's reform plan
is the most decisive factor to these heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the Christian Democrats say what Schroeder
has done is far not enough. They demand a more liberal society
with less state intervention, less bureaucracy, and further lower
tax rates.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CDU, said the chancellor was
mainly dealing with fixing the mistakes he had made in his first
10 months in office. It was Schroeder who added the budget by 30
billion marks in fiscal year 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's ruling record is full of "broken promises" and "big
declarations followed by lots of hot air," Schaeuble said during
the parliament debate.
</P>
<P>
"One thing that Germany does not lack is state intervention,"
he said. "We need less state intervention, less bureaucracy and
lower tax rates for everyone."

<HEADLINE> Local Security Chiefs Dismissed for Lax Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Two top security chiefs in
Egypt's northern city of Port Said have been dismissed for
dereliction of duty which led to an attack on President Hosni
Mubarak in early September, a police official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Habib el-Adli has announced the dismissal of
the city's Security Director Maj. Gen. Hassan Abdel Motteleb
Othman Jebril and Director of State Security Investigation
Maj. Gen. Abdullah Nasr, said the official on customary condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The two security chiefs, along with 14 other police officers
and an unspecified number of junior policemen, were referred to a
police disciplinary committee after a knife-wielding man was able
to approach Mubarak's motorcade in Port Said and injure the
president slightly in the arm on September 6.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli's announcement revised a Tuesday ruling by the
disciplinary committee which censured the two top officers for
dereliction of duty and ordered that they retire next July without
pension, the police official said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has blamed the attack on lax security and ordered a
security review.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Hani el-Azabi was
transferred to the post of border security chief following the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The attacker, whom police said was deranged, was shot dead by
Mubarak's guards.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Palestinians to Coordinate Stance on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein and visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed
Thursday to coordinate bilateral efforts and stance for the
future final status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders stressed the importance of coordinating efforts
and stance in the Middle East peace process, particularly over
the implementation of the Wye River peace accord, the Sharm El
Sheikh accord and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah reaffirmed Jordan's persistent support for the
Palestinians in their struggle to regain all legitimate rights
and to establish an independent state on their own soil, Jordan's
official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed his appreciation for Abdullah's outstanding
efforts to help revive the peace process in the region, Petra
said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader left Amman for home Thursday after two
hours of talks with Abdullah on the latest developments in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan is providing shelter to some 1.3 million
registered Palestinian refugees and the refugee issue is sure to
prop up in the final status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah has repeated on many occasions that it is the
holy rights of the Palestinian refugees in the region to return
home.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has been opposed to the returning home of some
3 million Palestinian refugees in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped its interests would not be adversely affected in
the future final status talks, particularly over the refugee
issue and water sharing arrangements.

<HEADLINE> China Described as Trustworthy Friend of Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid stressed on Thursday that China is Arab
countries' trustworthy friend and that the Arab League attaches
importance to the friendly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ji Peiding,
Abdel-Meguid said the just-concluded 112th Arab foreign ministers'
meeting adopted a resolution that the Arab countries will further
enhance the friendly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
An ongoing meeting of the Arab League Economic Council also
underlined the importance of strengthening the cooperation ties
with China, said the chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum.
</P>
<P>
Ji Peiding arrived in Cairo earlier in the day to preside over
a meeting attended by Chinese ambassadors and consuls to the
countries in West Asia and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ji told Abdel-Meguid that boosting close relations with the
developing countries is a key part of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
On issues in the Middle East, Abdel-Meguid said the Arab League
supports solutions to the Arab-Israeli conflict through peaceful
talks in a bid to realize a just, durable and comprehensive peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the land-for-peace principle form
the basis of any solution to the Middle East problem.
</P>
<P>
Ji expressed China's support for a comprehensive solution to
the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is based on the relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iraq issue, Abdel-Meguid said Iraq must fully
carry out the U.N. Security Council resolutions in an effort to
get the crippling economic sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
He called on China, one of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, to further its efforts with other U.N.
members to have the sanctions, which the U.N. imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, lifted.
</P>
<P>
Ji Peiding said that China speaks highly of the efforts exerted
by the Arab League to help solve the Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Iraq issue will soon be resolved on the
basis of Iraq's compliance with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Fischer: Germany Prepared to Help East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Berlin has been ready to
contribute humanitarian aid to East Timor and help its
re-construction, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Germany cannot stand back in this situation," Fischer was
quoted by the Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) news agency as telling
his aides when he took part in the parliamentary debates in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for a quick implementation of the U.N.
Security Council resolution on East Timor, and he said Indonesia
should take responsibility for "guaranteeing the safety of all the
people in East Timor."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Germany was possible to send a medical group
included in the 7000-strong international peace-keeping force that
is expected to land in the territory Sunday or Monday to disarm
the militia, but he ruled out any German combating troops in the
peacekeepers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angola Denies Having Asked S. Africa for Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government spiked
here Thursday a rumor that Angola had asked South Africa for
troops in support.
</P>
<P>
"The Angolan government refutes categorically the affirmations
and declares that it will never, at any moment, have the intention
to solicit South African troops for Angola," a document from the
Angolan Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the rumor originated from a
declaration of the Defense Ministry of South Africa published in
the magazine The Century of Johannesburg on September 6.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was made by the South African Defense Ministry
in an interview with the Financial Mail magazine, the Angolan
Foreign Ministry said, adding that "the Angolan government
considers such pronouncement as unwonted, provocative and not
deserving the dignity of a representative of a country with which
Angola maintains friendly relations".
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate response from the South African
government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that the United States would send 200 people to
participate in a multinational force to restore order in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We will deploy about 200 people, about half of whom will serve
on the ground in East Timor. In addition elements of the Pacific
Fleet will provide support," he told reporter at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to contribute to the force in a limited but
essential way, including communications and logistical aid,
intelligence, airlifts of personnel and material and coordination
of the humanitarian response to the tragedy," he said.
</P>
<P>
His decision followed consultations with Australia as well as
with the U.S. Congress, where many members are reluctant to see a
big deployment of U.S. forces to the area.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the deployment of limited U.S. troops was "in
America's interest."
</P>
<P>
Australia will lead the 8,000-member force, which is being sent
to restore order after two weeks of violence following a vote n
favor of independence in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces Deny Building Up Troops in E. Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Allied Forces Headquarters Thursday
dismissed rebel allegations that they are deploying and
reinforcing force in Kole, a eastern town of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Thursday, the allied forces
were reacting to a statement made by the Goma faction of the major
DRC rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lambert Mende, spokesman of the faction based in eastern DRC
town of Goma, said in the statement Wednesday that the allied
forces were building up troops in Kole.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean troops were singled out as the main force that was
deploying and reinforcing its positions at Kole, according to the
rebel's statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was aimed at misleading the international
community and lend credit to the rebels' intention of breaking the
cease-fire, said the allied forces supporting the DRC President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We are a professional and disciplined force which cannot and
will not act against the decisions taken by Heads of State in
Lusaka on July 10, and further to that we respect the ratification
of the accord of August 31 by the rebels," the allied forces said.
</P>
<P>
They warned the rebels that if they attacked their positions,
their forces would not hesitate to retaliate with all the means
available.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Buy Ozone-friendly Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean
environment official has called on the people to buy household
electrical appliances which do not contain ozone depleting
substances.
</P>
<P>
Substances such as chloro-fluoro carbon, methyl bromite and
many others were used in the refrigeration and air-conditioning
sectors in the country, Deputy Minister of Mines, Environment and
Tourism Edward Chindori-Chininga said at a function celebrating
the World Ozone Day in Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the industry to help in phasing-out the dangerous
 substances.
</P>
<P>
The substances were harmful to people as they cause skin cancer
and eye cataracts when released into the air, the deputy minister
said, adding that the substances also affect plants, crops and
other organisms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government is in the process of phasing-out
all ozone depleting substances in the country. Ozone is a thin

HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Medical
Research Council has been challenged to consider linking health
institutions through networking to provide well researched
information on health to relevant institutions throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Improving the access of Zimbabwean scientists and health
workers to research information is an area where cost effective
results can be seen within a short time span," Zimbabwean Health
and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a workshop on health and research for
development, the minister said such a system would improve the
flow of local research information, solutions and overall improve
the health of the majority of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Researchers and health workers need to take advantage of the
revolution in information and communication technology to easily
access and assimilate new data, ideas and strategies, said Stamps.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that research conducted in Zimbabwe must be
available and used by Zimbabweans for the benefit of the country.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from various medical institutions around
the country would discuss at the workshop on how medical
researchers can get health information easily and quickly.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Vows to Put Forward Austerity Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder told lawmakers in a heated debate over his new fiscal
reform draft in Berlin Thursday that he would pursue the austerity
policy with "courage and determination."
</P>
<P>
The unwelcome package was "just what Germany bitterly needs
now," Schroeder said while lashing out at the opposition who
called the plan a "hoodwink."
</P>
<P>
His center-left coalition government inherited a state debt as
high as 1.5 trillion marks (800 billion U.S. dollars) from his
predecessor Helmut Kohl, Schroeder said at Berlin's Reichstag
building. More than 600 members of the Bundestag, the lower
chamber of the German parliament, are holding days of debate over
the package before voting.
</P>
<P>
"We are paying 82 billion marks a year just for the interest on
this sum," he said, accusing the then ruling Christian Democrats
(CDU) of bringing the country "to the edge of immobilization."
</P>
<P>
Now, before any political priority can be established, he must
at first "step by step" cut the state debt with the reform
package, Schroeder stressed, adding: "We are on the right path,
also for cutting the jobless rate."
</P>
<P>
The austerity plan, drafted by Finance Minister Hans Eichel and
supported by Schroeder, will cut Germany's state budget by 30
billion marks in the year 2000 and more in following years if it
is passed in parliament. Spending on the government, the public
health and other social welfare issues will be drastically reduced
while tax rates will be lowered under the plan.
</P>
<P>
Since it came onto table in this June, the package has pulled
Schroeder into a multi-front war. Both the left-wingers in his
Social Democratic Party (SPD), the powerful labor unions, and the
conservative CDU have disavowed Schroeder's policy.
</P>
<P>
Traditionalists in the SPD and the labor unions said Schroeder,
betraying the party's ideal of "social justice," would hurt the
interests of the weak. Dozens of SPD members, including
high-ranking party leaders, have announced they will vote against
the austerity package.
</P>
<P>
And plain Germans, living decades under one of the world's most
perfect social welfare systems, are worried about their future.
Many have voted against Schroeder's SPD in recent regional
elections.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, the SPD was defeated by the CDU in state
elections in Thuringia and Saarland, lost sole control of
Brandenburg state, and lost majority in municipal elections in
North Rhine-Westphalia state. Analysts say Schroeder's reform plan
is the most decisive factor to these heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the Christian Democrats say what Schroeder
has done is far not enough. They demand a more liberal society
with less state intervention, less bureaucracy, and further lower
tax rates.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CDU, said the chancellor was
mainly dealing with fixing the mistakes he had made in his first
10 months in office. It was Schroeder who added the budget by 30
billion marks in fiscal year 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's ruling record is full of "broken promises" and "big
declarations followed by lots of hot air," Schaeuble said during
the parliament debate.
</P>
<P>
"One thing that Germany does not lack is state intervention,"
he said. "We need less state intervention, less bureaucracy and
lower tax rates for everyone."

<HEADLINE> UNEP Stresses Efforts on Ozone Layer Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) Thursday called on governments,
industries and individuals alike for a total commitment to
ozone-friendly practices in order to ensure restoration of the
ozone layer by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
The International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer
is celebrated on September 16 each year. This year's theme is
"Save our sky: be ozone friendly."
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not the ozone layer recovers at the expected time,
will be determined by the joint efforts of governments as well as
individuals," UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer said on the
special occasion for the ozone layer protection.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken positive action and signed agreements but
continued actions are pivotal to the healing of the ozone layer.
There is no room for complacency," Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion, the U. N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan noted that alternative ozone-friendly technologies and
products are now available throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged "every individual, office and industry to review
their homes and premises and do all they can do to be
ozone-friendly."
</P>
<P>
The industrialized countries have now almost phased out their
use of CFCs. On July 1 this year, developing countries began a
freeze on production and consumption of the substance. This is to
be followed by a gradual phase-out in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Despite these efforts, the ozone layer is still in a vulnerable
state. The size of the ozone hole over the Antarctica has been at
least 20 million square kilometers in the last few years, about
the double size of Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Thursday reaffirmed his country's adherence to the
one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ji Peiding,
Moussa stressed that Egypt consistently sticks to the one-China
policy.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Li Teng-hui, leader of the Taiwan authorities,
described in early July the relations across the Taiwan Straits as
"state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state relations,"
Egypt issued a statement which reiterated its adherence to the
one-China position.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of Egypt and China maintain time-honored friendship
and the two countries have close political ties, Moussa said
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' most important task at present is to exert
further efforts to enhance the cooperative ties between the two
countries based on mutual benefits, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ji arrived in Cairo earlier in the day to preside over a
meeting attended by Chinese ambassadors and consuls to the
countries in West Asia and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ji said that China and Egypt enjoy longstanding friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Egypt in 1996 and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak paid a visit to China last April,
during which the two countries reached an agreement on
establishing a strategic partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's gratitude to Egypt for its constant
support on the issues of Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
China speaks highly of Egypt's efforts in helping advance the
Middle East peace process, and resolve regional conflicts in
Africa and safeguard African unity and cooperation, Ji said.

<HEADLINE> Toll Reaches 17 in Russian City Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in
a bomb explosion early Thursday near an apartment building in the
southern Russian city of Volgodonsk has risen to 17, including two
children, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five tenants of the nine-story prefabricated-panel
building have been hospitalized, 25 of them in serious condition,
an official from the Rostov Main Regional Department for Emergency
Situations was quoted by Interfax as saying.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the bomb was inside a GAZ-53 truck parking near
the building situated in 35 Gagarin Street. A total of 275 people
have applied for medical aid.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin described the blast as "barbaric act of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said after meeting
Yeltsin in the Kremlin Thursday morning that "Everybody must act
resolutely, persistently and energetically at all levels in order
to combat terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe terrorists with links to Chechen rebels
staged the explosion.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth explosion in Russia since August 31, when a
bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the Kremlin,
killing one and injuring dozens.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, a car bomb destroyed a residential block inside
a military compound in Buinaksk, Daghestan, killing 64, including
many women and children.
</P>
<P>
On September 8 and 12 two explosions killed more than 200
people in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Security remains heavy in Moscow, where interior troops joined
the police in patrolling and checking suspicious sites and persons.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, a spokesman for the Federal Security
Service (FSS), the main successor to the Soviet KGB, said six
mines have been found in Moscow with the help of citizens.
</P>
<P>
"These mines were equipped with timers, the last of which would
have exploded on September 21. All the devices were neutralized,"
Interfax quoted Zdanovich as saying Thursday.

<HEADLINE> S. African Air Force Stands to Gain from Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African Air
Force (SAAF) will acquire several sophisticated new fighter
aircraft and helicopters under an arms procurement package
approved by Cabinet on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, South Africa will spend 21.3 billion rand
(about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars) over the next eight years on
defense equipment for the air force and navy and with the option
of buying 8.5 billion rand (1.4 billion dollars) more by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The SAAF can expect the delivery of 12 British
Aerospace-supplied Hawk 100 fighter trainers, customized to meet
specific South African needs, by 2005.
</P>
<P>
A further 12 will be delivered by 2006, subject to the
government exercising its option to buy.
</P>
<P>
The dual-seat aircraft, optimized for jet training and
weapon-delivery training, combat and reconnaissance, will replace
the current Impala trainers, which have been in use since the
1960s and are now declared obsolete by the SAAF.
</P>
<P>
The Impalas will be removed from the inventory as the Hawks are
brought into service.
</P>
<P>
The Hawk is powered by the latest version of the Rolls Royce
Adour engine, and has a maximum level speed of Mach 0,85.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft is capable of delivering the SAAF's Mark 81 and 82
bombs, practise bombs and rockets.
</P>
<P>
It is fitted with a 30 millimetre cannon, in a pod on the
aircraft's belly.
</P>
<P>
Also earmarked for the air force are nine Gripen JAS 39
dual-seat fighter aircraft from British Aerospace/Saab, due for
delivery between 2006 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen single-seat Gripens will arrive between 2009 and 2011
if the government exercises its option to buy them, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The SAAF will also acquire 30 twin-engined A109 (one-oh-nine)
light utility helicopters from Augusta in Italy, the first due for
 delivery in 2003, to be followed by about ten a year.

<HEADLINE> Inquiry Into Netanyahu Gains Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein and State Attorney Edna Arbel said here
Thursday that they support the police investigation on
allegations against former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
his wife for taking bribes and misusing public funds.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli police are doing their professional job in
investigating former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
wife Sara on suspicions of receiving bribes and the investigation
does not have any political motives," said the two top judges
after meeting with the police officials in charge of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The police opened an investigation against Netanyahu and his
wife Wednesday and questioned them separately for more than eight
hours. But Netanyahu denied all the allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's case broke Tuesday when the local Hebrew-language
paper Yediot Aharonot ran a promotion of its own investigation
into Netanyahu's dealings.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Netanyahu received various domestic
maintenance and home renovation services from Avner Amedi, a
58-year-old Jerusalem businessman who owns a maintenance company.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Amedi's company supplied Netanyahu with a
variety of services during his term as prime minister, but Amedi
neither requested nor received any payment for the services, which
were carried out not only at the prime minister's office, but at
the couple's home and their official residence.
</P>
<P>
According to the story, after Netanyahu lost the May election,
Amedi presented the Prime Minister's Office a bill for 440,000
Shekels (about 100,000 U.S. dollars). The Treasury authorized
payment to him only 12,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said Netanyahu claimed he never asked Amedi to
carry out work for him.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Amedi on Tuesday on suspicions of having bribed
Netanyahu and the Tel Aviv Magistrate Court remanded him for two
days.

contacting some powerful individuals within and outside the
country, to plead their case with government.

Abuja after giving an undertaking to be law-abiding.

During the discussion, the delegates said the African Charter
and other international charters and conventions should be

and treatment for AIDS patients.
</P>

Charles Ngwena, a professor of law from South Africa, said the
right to treatment should be guaranteed for all the people

constitutions which make it obligatory for the states to ensure
access to treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS.

Other countries like Zambia rely on direct principles to ensure

However, most African countries lack the financial capacity to
meet all the obligations associated with taking care of HIV/AIDS
patients even if they are taken to court over the matter, he

Ngwena said African governments should set benchmarks and
incorporate the provision of health care to people living with
HIV/AIDS into their socio-economic programs coupled with readily
available resources.

CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to
provide Turkey with an emergency loan of 330 million U.S. dollars
to help the country repair earthquake damages, the local Daily
News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following a visit to the quake-stricken region in Turkey, IMF
official Carlo Cotarelli said that it is necessary to channel more
relief fund to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Ministers of Petroleum of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states will meet Saturday in Riyadh to reaffirm
their support to maintaining the current level of oil production
until March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) decided last March to cut down oil production by
over 2.1 million barrels per day as from April 1 in an effort to
shore up oil prices in world markets, the Egyptian daily Alam Al
Yom reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has seen its trade deficit in the first seven
months of 1999 stand at 746.9 million dinars (1.05 billion
U.S. dollars), down by 14.1 percent as compared to 869 million
dinars (1.2 billion dollars) during the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Jordanian Statistics Administration have shown
a rise in exports by 2.5 percent during the period under review.
</P>
<P>
The volume of re-exported commodities also rose by 3.6 percent
to reach 129 million dinars (182.2 million dollars), the Egyptian
daily Alam Al Yom Thursday quoted the figures as saying.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Rural Development Mahmoud Sherif
said his ministry has financed about 7,786 private development
projects for Egyptian rural women, at a total cost of about 157.5
million Egyptian pounds (45.7 million U.S. dollars), thus
providing some 46,000 job opportunities to women.
</P>
<P>
Of these projects, 6,500 are economic projects for rural women
to increase their income and these projects are financed by soft
loans to the tune of 67 million pounds (19.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another 139 health projects are under way with an investment of
21 million pounds (6.09 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Keeps Rising Slowly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Production at U.S.
factories, mines and utilities increased for the seventh straight
month in August, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that industrial output rose by 0.3 percent last
month, compared with a 0.7 percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
This year, production has been rising since February, after
declining in 1998 to the slowest pace in five years.
</P>
<P>
At factories alone, production increased 0.4 percent, following
a 0.6 percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
August's advance was led by auto-makers. Production of motor
vehicles and parts surged by 8.1 percent. Makers of computers and
chemicals also increased their output, although production of
household appliances, construction supplies and industrial
equipment declined.
</P>
<P>
Output by utilities dropped by 1.6 percent in August, a decline
expected as summer began to wane and use of electricity for air
conditioners fell. During a hot dry July, utility production had
risen 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mining output picked up 0.6 percent last month, after a 0.9
percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase in production pushed the overall
operating capacity of U.S. industry up slightly to 80.8 percent
from 80.7 percent in July. But it is still well below the level at
which analysts begin to worry about production bottlenecks, and
below average for the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The steady increase this year in industrial output comes after
U.S. manufacturers were hard-hit by loss of export caused by the
world economic turmoil since mid-1997.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Liu Struggles at China Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 16 (Xinhua) -- World champion and No.
1 men's singles player Liu Guoliang made a shaky start at the
China Grand Prix Table Tennis Championships as he conceded one set
to a German qualifier in a first round match here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion and tournament's top seed, suffering
from a shoulder injury, wobbled before getting past the unknown
German Torben Wosik 21-12, 15-21, 21-16, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who last month emulated the legend Swede Jan-ove Waldner
to become the only second player in the game's history to complete
a table tennis "Grand Slam" of Olympics, world cup and world
championships titles, seemed to lose his concentration in the
second set.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese penholder made quite a few unforced errors while
the German took full advantage of his aberration to wrap up the
set 21-15.
</P>
<P>
But Liu regrouped himself quickly and made sure there would be
no chance for the unpet-minded Wosik with his trademark tricky
service and follow-up attack.
</P>
<P>
"I was not focused enough in the second set," Liu said. "and he
(Wosik) played a gallant game."
</P>
<P>
In today's earlier action, Wang Nan, Liu's female teammate who
won the women's singles title at the world championships last
month, opened strongly with a 21-10, 21-9, 21-16 routine win over
Japanese Aya Umemura.
</P>
<P>
The China Grand Prix, an ITTF Pro-Tour event which was
inaugurated in 1988, attracted 114 players from 18 countries and
regions to attend four-category competitions running from 16-18.
</P>
<P>
The prize money for the tournament is 61,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit Enhances Understanding, Friendship: Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- An important achievement of
President Jiang Zemin's visit to Thailand, Australia and New
Zealand is that he made an extensive contact with people of
various circles and thus enhanced mutual understanding and
friendship, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi who
accompanied President Jiang on the visit told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his state visit to these countries and on the sideline
of the Informal meeting of the leaders of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, President Jiang Zemin met with
government officials, members of parliament, businessmen and
people from the press, cultural, educational, scientific and
technological circles, overseas Chinese and Chinese students
studying abroad, Yang said on the special plane back to China.
</P>
<P>
During these meetings, Jiang briefed them on the situation in
China following reform and opening up and China's domestic and
foreign policies, enabling them to have a better understanding of
China and support efforts for developing friendly and cooperative
relations with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Jiang clarified China's principled stand on
Falun Gong. Jiang pointed out that the Falun Gong cult is a
malicious organization, and the Chinese government banned it in
order to defend the basic interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang also visited farms, schools, enterprises and
scientific research institutions, where he met many people and was
warmly welcomed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Relax Export Limits on Encryption Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
is relaxing restrictions on exports of encryption software and
hardware products, a decision seen as a major shift in a
longstanding policy and a victory for the high-technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokeswoman said the move was intended to benefit
the economy, preserve privacy, serve the national security
interest and protect law enforcement capabilities. She said the
details of the step would be released later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For years, U.S. law enforcement and military officials have
opposed easing restrictions on encoding technology, contending
that wider availability of encryption products would hinder
efforts to fight cyber crimes. High-tech companies, in the other
hand, have countered that encryption products are already widely
available overseas.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the administration's encryption policy has
eased somewhat. But administration officials said the new changes
will let companies sell data-scrambling products to companies and
non-government users after a one-time technical review by the U.S.
Commerce Department, according to The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, these officials said, companies could sell
specialized, custom encryption products -- those not designed for
retail sale -- to companies or individuals abroad, also after the
one-time review.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great leap forward," Dan Scheinman, senior vice
president of legal and government affairs at Cisco Systems Inc., a
big maker of networking gear in San Jose, California, told The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our current understanding, the industry can now
compete on equal footing with our foreign competitors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech officials have complained that current Commerce
Department rules are complicated and inconsistent. U.S. companies
can sell encryption products to foreign banks and financial
institutions, but not to telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
But even under the eased restrictions, companies will be
required to submit detailed lists of their buyers, and they will
be barred from selling in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North
Korea and Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's View on World Situation Shows China's Stance on Peace, Development: Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
's elaboration on the international and Asian-Pacific situation
during his recent three-nation tour "fully" demonstrates China's
firm stance on maintaining world peace and promoting common
development, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang has comprehensively expounded the opinion of the Chinese
government on the current international and Asian-Pacific
situation, which fully demonstrates the good wish and firm stance
of the Chinese government and its people on maintaining world
peace and promoting common development," Yang told reporters on
Jiang's special plane, which is on its way back from New Zealand
with Jiang and his entourage aboard.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand was the last stop of Jiang's three-nation tour from
September 2 to 16, which has also taken him to Thailand and
Australia. Before starting his state visit to New Zealand, Jiang
attended an informal meeting of the leaders of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum hosted by the country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the meeting, Jiang said that at present, the
international situation is, on the whole, still developing towards
relaxation, but the world is not yet tranquil.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that destabilizing and uncertain factors have
visibly increased, posing new challenges to world peace and
development, the two major tasks of the world which have not been
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Under such complex circumstances, Jiang called on APEC members
to work unswervingly to promote the lofty cause of peace and
development in the fundamental interests of the people of their
own nations and of the world, and in keeping with the historical
trend.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is of great significance and has a far-reaching
impact," Yang noted.

GENEVA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The head of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has called for broader
participation of developing countries in the electronic commerce
industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the three-day International Conference
on E-Commerce and Intellectual Property, WIPO Director-General
Kamil Idris said that through the use of WIPO net and other means,
developing countries could have access to IP information,
participate in global policy formulation, and gain opportunities
to use IP in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
In a separate press release, WIPO said that e-commerce poses a
number of challenges to developing countries, but also many
opportunities. For instance, it said, forecasts show that by 2005,
Asia-Pacific Internet users would exceed some 375 million and
China would surpass the United States to have the most users of
the world.
</P>
<P>
It said that developing countries can avoid the heavy
investment required to build an industrial technology
infrastructure because the entry barriers for electronic commerce
are low.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 delegates from WIPO members and the e-commerce
industry attended the first-ever conference held by the WIPO at
the international level to address the global implications of
e-commerce with a focus on intellectual property.

BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports reached
4.98 billion U.S. dollars in August 1999, a 14.7 percent increase
over the same period last year, the official Thai News Agency

</P>
<P>
Quoting Permanent Secretary of the Commerce Ministry Sompol
Kiatpaiboon, TNA said that for the first eight months this year,

Thailand is expected to reach the targeted export growth rate
of four percent, or overall value of 56.6 billion dollars, this
year so long as the exports manage to maintain no less than 4.8
billion dollars a month for the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Exposes Lee Teng-hui's Separation Attempt: Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Reiterating China's
principled stand over the Taiwan issue, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin exposed the essence of Lee Teng-hui's "two-states" remark
during his recent Asia-Pacific tour and expressed China's
determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial
integrity, a senior Chinese official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his 14-day Asia-Pacific tour from September 2 to 16,
Jiang exposed Lee Teng-hui's attempt to separate China, dealing a
heavy blow to the "Taiwan Independence" forces inside or outside
the island, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Chinese people's strong opposition to Lee's "two-
states" remark and the one-China stand recently reaffirmed by more
than 100 countries, Jiang predicted a complete failure of Lee's
conspiracy to split China and stressed the Chinese people's
determination to realize a complete reunification of their country,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's basic principle of peaceful reunification
and "one country, two systems" on the Taiwan issue, Jiang stressed
that China will never commit itself to abandoning the use of force
in order to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from Thailand, Australia and New Zealand all
expressed their understanding of China's stance and emphasized
their persistence in one-China policy. They all agreed that Lee's
"two-states" remark has done harm to the peace and stability in
the Asian-Pacific region and intensified the cross-straits
relations, Yang added.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Sees Two Intellectual Property Treaties to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The head of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Thursday expressed the
hope that two WIPO treaties signed in December 1996 would enter
into force before December 2001.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the end of the three-day International
Conference on E-Commerce and Intellectual Property, WIPO
Director-General Kamil Idris also asked state parties to the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) to extend its principles
to audiovisual works and performances as a step to the adjustment
of the international legislative framework to facilitate
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The other treaty signed in 1996 is the WIPO Copyright Treaty
(WCT).
</P>
<P>
The two treaties establish the basic standards of protection
for copyright and related rights on the Internet and other digital
networks, according to the WIPO. They contain a general update of
the legal principles underpinning international protection of
copyright and the rights of performers and phonogram producers in
cyberspace, more particularly on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the WIPO Internet treaties adopted in December
1996 clarify that national law must prevent unauthorized access to
and use of creative works which, given the global reach of the
Internet, may be downloaded anywhere in the world at the push of a
button.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, only nine and seven countries respectively signed
the two treaties. At least 30 states must adhere to each of the
treaties before they enter into force.

<HEADLINE> Russian Peacekeepers Not to Force their Way into Orahovac, Says Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo
do not intend to force their way into Orahovac, commander of the
Russian contingent Major General Valery Yevtukhovich said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yevtukhovich dismissed as absolutely groundless allegations
that local residents are afraid of Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"Local residents as well as the organizers of the road block
had many chances to see that our peacekeepers are acting
impartially in full accordance with all the provisions of the
operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Orahovac have been blocking approaches to the town

<HEADLINE> NATO General Reveals Kosovo War Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Allied
Commander Europe General Wesley K. Clark said here Thursday that a
Kosovo strike assessment team has worked out a finding about NATO
strikes on mobile targets in its war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Clark said NATO declassified documents of investigations
conducted by analysts during and after the war. But NATO said it
does not, in any way, evaluate the success of the political or
diplomatic aspects of NATO's efforts with regard to Kosovo, but
only military actions.
</P>
<P>
The NATO general said the team found evidence on the ground and
through collaboration of secondary intelligence sources of strikes
on 93 tanks, 153 armored personnel carriers, 339 military
vehicles, and 389 artillery pieces and mortars, which Clark said
proved to be success of NATO's military action.
</P>
<P>
NATO also said the study assesses the number of strikes against
mobile targets but not the severity of the damage to the target.
He stressed that "strike" means weapon physically impacted a valid
target but does not indicate the degree of damage inflicted on the
target.
</P>
<P>
"It also is not an evaluation of strategy. Neither did the team
evaluate our target selection or the process of selecting those
targets. This is an evaluation of our effectiveness in striking
selected targets," NATO said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It will form a part, but certainly not the whole, of our
after-action reviews of Allied Forces," NATO added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lending Reaches Record High in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's new
lending commitments to client countries reached a record 29
billion U.S. dollars in its fiscal year 1999 ending on June 30,
due in large part to assistance for reforms in East Asia,
according to the bank's 1999 Annual Report released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the bank's total lending commitments were 28.6
billion dollars in FY98 and 19.1 billion dollars in FY97.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank disbursed 24.2 billion dollars to client
countries in FY99.
</P>
<P>
East Asia received a third of total lending in FY99, reflecting
the large needs of countries recovering from financial crisis, the
report said. The bank also responded quickly to new crises and
risks of contagion in the Latin America and Caribbean and the
Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions.
</P>
<P>
The year's five largest borrowers were Argentina (3.2 billion
dollars), Indonesia (2.7 billion dollars), China (2.1 billion
dollars), South Korea (2.0 billion dollars), and Russia (1.9
billion dollars). The top 10 borrowers -- including Brazil,
Thailand, India, Bangladesh, and Mexico -- accounted for 62
percent of total lending.
</P>
<P>
By sectors, lending for human development -- education, health,
nutrition, and social protection -- accounted for the largest
share of FY99 lending (7.3 billion dollars). Nearly half this
total was for social protection, to address reemerging poverty,
widening inequality, and welfare losses especially in crisis
countries. Such assistance was nearly 42 percent above last year's
level.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that adjustment lending, which includes
institution-building, governance, multisector (economic policy)
loans, and social protection, was 15.3 billion dollars in FY99,
exceeding investment lending for the first time ever, as the bank
supported a wide range of reforms in the aftermath of crisis. More
than half of adjustment lending in FY99 was poverty-focused, with
strong support to social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Investment lending supported diverse needs, ranging from girls'
education and disease control to urban congestion and -- unique to
this year -- the Year 2000 computer problem, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year, the quality of lending also improved,
due largely to the changes made as part of the World Bank's
corporate renewal program, or Strategic Compact, which was
introduced in 1997, the report said. The goals of the Compact are
to better serve clients and to intensify the bank's focus on
poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Russian-China Ties Not Against Third Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China are not
planning to create a military-political union against any third
countries, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday at
parliamentary hearings on the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic of China and Russia's diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and China are not striving to form any
military-political alliance directed against anyone. They consider
the policy of strengthening existing blocs a mistake," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries are very alarmed by the U.S. plans to
develop and deploy a national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
"If implemented, they could threaten to undermine the ABM
treaty, which would result in the appearance of new factors
capable of destabilizing the situation in the region as well as
the world, reviving the arms race and creating additional
obstacles to disarmament," the Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Beijing are of the opinion that the implementation
of existing plans and the deployment of anti-missile systems in
several Asian and Pacific countries "could have a negative effect
on regional stability, lead to the growth of tension in conflict
spots in the region," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russian-Chinese foreign policy cooperation relies "on the
coincidence or proximity of our approaches to fundamental
questions of world development and concrete international
problems," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides favor a fair and multipolar world order that
guarantees the lawful interests of all countries, Ivanov said,
adding that this is the meaning and main purpose of the strategic
partnership between Russia and China.

<HEADLINE> Balance Urged in Cultural Exchange Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese Nobel
Literature Laureate, Jose Saramago, Thursday called for a balance
in the cultural exchange among the Portuguese-speaking nations.
</P>
<P>
Saramago made the call during the second "Lusophone Bridges", a
cultural event that is going on in Maputo from September 15 to 19
with participants coming from all over the Portuguese-speaking
world.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel laureate said that a balance is necessary,
particularly when one speaks of "bridges".
</P>
<P>
It is necessary that a "bridge" be built from each country to
other Portuguese-speaking countries as a way of bringing the
peoples closer together and preserving the Portuguese language, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The advancement of Portugal, in terms of language and culture,
toward other Portuguese-speaking countries should meet with a
reciprocal move from them, which will bring peoples closer to each
other, so preserving the Portuguese language," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The event is organized by the Portuguese Camoes Institute, and
is the second of its kind. The first took place in Lisbon last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambican Minister of Culture, Youth and Sport,
Mateus Katupha, praised the Portuguese initiative as one that
brings together different forms of cultural expression for the
benefit of the Portuguese language.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Katupha pointed out that while
Portuguese is Mozambique's official language, it is not the
language most Mozambicans use to communicate in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Mozambicans are not really "Lusophone" but are "Bantuphone",
since the mother tongues of the overwhelming majority of
Mozambican citizens are various Bantu languages.

determine the threshold for any form of intervention."

proposed measures of protecting the civilians in armed conflict

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Plan to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has launched a 180-million-rand (30 million U.S.
dollars) plan to lure an extra three million foreign tourists to
the country in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Launching the strategy in Pretoria Thursday, Environmental
Affairs and Tourism Minister Valli Moosa said that an urgency to
vitalize the tourism sector had prompted the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was expected to bring about 8.5 million tourists
to South Africa by the year 2002, compared with 5.7 million that
visited the country last year.
</P>
<P>
This would push the number of jobs created by tourism from
737,000 last year to more than one million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Such an approach would spell disaster in the competitive world
of international tourism, South African Press Association quoted
Moosa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first focus of the plan was short-term marketing campaigns
to boost South Africa's share of tourists from Britain, the United
States, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, comprehensive research would be done with a
view to also tapping into emerging tourism markets in Asia, the
Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan was the first joint tourism effort by the
government and private sector.
</P>
<P>
"Both the private and public sectors have dug deep in their
pockets to raise the money required to fund the plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Business Trust each gave 50 million rand
for the initiative, while the Tourism Business Council would
provide 25 million.
</P>
<P>
Another 45 million came from the budget of South African
Tourism. South African Airways gave 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of South African Tourism, Stewart Lumka
described the plan as a ground breaking initiative.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely enthusiastic... that tourism will at last
realize its potential and make a meaningful contribution by
impacting significantly on job creation and foreign exchange
earnings," Lumka said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Demands Urgent Steps Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin on Thursday issued a resolution tasking executive
agencies with taking urgent steps to stem the spate of terrorism
across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, within three days, the agencies
must draw up and confirm plans to enhance the stable operation of
industry, transport, communications, the nuclear, fuel and energy
as well as food complexes, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Temporary operations bases will be established to protect
people and essential facilities from terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be also be taken to ensure security in
residential areas, at mass gatherings, in educational, health
care, cultural and sporting facilities.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies are instructed to carry out
investigations aimed at intercepting terrorist groups, including
those with international ties.
</P>
<P>
The resolution came after a Thursday explosion near an
apartment building in the southern city of Volgodonsk that killed
17 people and injured dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth explosion that rocked Russia since August 31,
when a bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the
Kremlin, killing one person and injuring dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, a car bomb destroyed a residential block inside
a military compound in Buinaksk, Daghestan, killing 64 people,
many of them women and children.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people were killed in two subsequent explosions
in the capital city on September 8 and 12.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe terrorists with links to Chechen rebels
were behind the blasts and security has been beefed up in Moscow
and around the country, especially near vital installations such
as nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Security presence remains heavy in Moscow, where interior
troops joined the police force in patrolling the capital city and
checking suspicious sites and persons.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, a spokesman with the Federal Security
Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet KGB, said six
mines have been found in Moscow during searches due to helpful
tip-offs from city residents.
</P>
<P>
"These mines were equipped with timers, the last of which would
ve elapsed on September 21. All the devices were neutralized,"
Interfax quoted Zdanovich as saying Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Aims to Increase Pyrethrum Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Pyrethrum
Board will distribute pyrethrum seeds worth 10 million shillings
(about 12,500 U. S. dollars) to farmers in southwestern regions of
Iringa and Mbeya in an effort to increase the production of the
insect repellent crop.
</P>
<P>
A zonal manager in Iringa, Godfrey Mbeyela, disclosed this plan
to the Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma, who inspected the
region earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Juma had wanted to know what the board is planning to revive
cultivation of the crop, a major foreign exchange earner for the
country, a report from Iringa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iringa, Mbeya, together with Arusha Region in the north, are
the main producers of pyrethrum in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mbeyela informed the vice-president of the board's plan to use
improved pyrethrum seeds that would produce more and better
pyrethrum flowers and its decision to encourage farmers to set up
their pyrethrum seed nurseries. He said prices of pyrethrum have
gone up this season.
</P>
<P>
Juma called on local residents to once again embark on
production of pyrethrum now that its marketing is no longer a
problem.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president emphasized that poverty alleviation will
only be possible if every able person works hard, especially on
land.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum output that reached its peak of 6,020 tons in 1966/67
 fiscal year tumbled to 600 tons per annum in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania plans to eventually raise the output of the crop to
between 1,500 and 2,000 tons a year, the Chief Executive of the
board, Ephraem Mhekwa, said at a meeting in June this year.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Russia to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday urged Russia to fight against
corruption and other crimes while defending the administration's
policy towards the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment on Russia, Albright said
Washington had called on Moscow to "bring under control the
epidemic of crime and corruption," but "the response from Russian
authorities has not been adequate."
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, Vice President Al Gore took the lead in pressing
Russia to enact money laundering and anti-crime legislation,"
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the response from Russian authorities has not
been adequate. President (Boris) Yeltsin's government needs at
last to make fighting corruption a priority."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, reports said that billions of U.S. dollars
including some financial aid from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) were diverted illegally from Russia to offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
The accusation has put the IMF and the Clinton administration
under fire. Some U.S. politicians urged to halt any further loans
to Russia before safeguarding measures were taken to prevent any
misuse or illegal diversion of the money.
</P>
<P>
Both IMF and the U.S. administration denied they had any
evidence to show that the money that had been diverted illegally
came from the IMF emergency loans, or bilateral aid from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of having the fullest possible
investigation," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has sent a group of experts to Washington this week for
talks with the U.S. over the case while the U.S. Congress prepares
for hearings next week on whether any U.S. aid to Russia had been
misused.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to Russian leaders has been to get tough on
corruption and to cooperate in full with investigations into it,
including money laundering and the use of IMF funds, no matter
where or to whom the evidence leads," she added.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress said the scandal shows the Clinton
administration's policy towards Russia is a failure. However,
Albright expressed his opposition to the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated the two goals of the U.S. policy towards
Russia: to increase the safety of the American people by working
to reduce Cold War arsenals, stop proliferation and create a
stable and undivided Europe; to support Russia's efforts to
transform its political, economic, social institutions.

<HEADLINE> Donor Aid Vital to Kenya's Economic Recovery: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Okemo made the remarks before leaving for the United States to
meet with officials from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan package to
Kenya in July, 1997 on the grounds of poor governance and rampant
corruption, which resulted in dramatic decline of the country's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered only 1.4
percent in the year to June compared with 1.8 percent last year
and 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Okemo noted that the restoration of talks with the IMF over the
loan package was important to build up investor's confidence and
lead to an economy recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting he would focus on persuading
donors to restore working relations with his country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government will continue to take measures
to cut government expenditure and keep down the rise on interest
rate yields after President Daniel arap Moi made a cabinet
reshuffle early September for downsizing the number of ministry
from 27 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Okemo said re-establishment of a loan program with the IMF was
key to boosting investors' confidence and would lead to an
economic recovery by September next year.
</P>
<P>
"This would be a critical step in order to regain access to
donor funds to ease our current serious budget constraints and to
reverse the current negative foreign capital outflows," Okemo
said.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Step Up Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President
Christon Tembo has urged the African leaders to mount a concerted,
purposeful, and persistent attack on HIV/AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Tembo made the call in Lusaka Thursday evening when officially
closing the 11th International Conference on AIDS and STDS
(sexually transmitted diseases) in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the common thread running through the discussion has
been one underpinned by the desire to find political, technical,
technological and societal solutions to the complex problems of
the HIV/AIDS and STDs.
</P>
<P>
"But even as we have been speaking and deliberating on HIV/AIDS
at the conference this week, it has become candidly clear that the
HIV/AIDS epidemic is as much a developmental challenge as it is a
political one" the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
He said political leadership is indispensable for a successful
outcome, in the response to the HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation
programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Let us resist proclaiming to the whole world that the panacea
for HIV/ AIDS lies in the billions of dollars to be poured in this
fight in Africa but rather that these resources will go toward
supporting indigenously developed plans, respecting the basic
tenets and principles of partnership, the different environments
and contexts that exist in Africa," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
African countries have agonized over the epidemic and its
deleterious effects on the overall development of the continent,
Tembo said, adding that there is no single country today in Africa
that has no strategic framework for a national response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the institutional and strategic structures for a
co-ordinated and more effective response in many countries have
continued to evolve and improve with accumulated knowledge and
experience, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a new HIV/AIDS STD council and secretariat
will be launched soon to facilitate the implementation of a
revolutionary strategic plan for the period between 2000 and 2003.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Disavows General's Remarks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Thursday disavowed a top general's threat to pull out
Russian peacekeepers from Kosovo, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure whether this is his own view or somebody
else's," Ivanov said. "Only the president, the prime minister and
the foreign minister can make foreign policy statements," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian
Defense Ministry's Department for International Military
Cooperation, threatened to pull out Russian troops from Kosovo if
the province's tendency of secession from Yugoslavia becomes
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
"If the tendency for Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia becomes
irreversible and the U.N. Security Council's resolution on Kosovo
is not implemented, the Federation Council (upper house of
parliament) may raise the question of whether our contingent's
further stay in the region is expedient," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. resolution on Kosovo, with the exception
of the provision on the deployment of a peacekeeping contingent,
is not being implemented, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The provision on ensuring the security of all ethnic groups
populating Kosovo, primarily of the non-Albanian population, is
not being fulfilled at all, Ivashov said, adding that "80 percent
of the Serbs living in Kosovo have become refugees."
</P>
<P>
He said that no decision on the return of Yugoslav security
forces to Kosovo has been taken to this day.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the borders of Kosovo remain open and Albanians
who did not live in Kosovo before, easily cross into the region.
Weapons and drugs also keep arriving into Kosovo through the open
borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, for his part, said the general's words should be taken
with a large pinch of salt, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of transforming the Kosovo Liberation Army
into a national guard, Ivanov said that under the appropriate U.N.
Security Council resolution, the KLA must be demilitarized and its
fighters re-integrated into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of a paramilitary agency under any name can only
make political settlement more difficult," the minister said.

Cheng said the Security Council, which is primarily
responsible for international peace and security, should
shoulder unshirkable responsibility in this area.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly oppose military actions in circumvention of the
Security Council that may result in conflict in an even larger
scale. We believe that the Council should continue its active
efforts in putting an end to the conflicts and diffusing the
crisis, for that is the contribution it should make to the issue
of protecting civilians in armed conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China believes at the same time that the international
community should take further steps to eradicate the root cause of
armed conflicts through helping countries concerned in poverty
eradication, economic development, national reconciliation and
maintenance of national stability," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of protecting civilians in armed conflicts
involves considerations in the political, humanitarian,
development and assistance fields and is better to be
deliberated more thoroughly in the General Assembly and the
Economic and Social Council, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favor of strengthening cooperation and coordination
between the Security council and other UN bodies, but at the same
time we believe that the various bodies in the UN should have
distinct division of work and operate accordingly," he added.

<P>
ABUJA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The border crisis between
Liberia and Guinea would hopefully be resolved peacefully,
officials said in Abuja Thursday before a regional mini-summit.
</P>
<P>
"Since the two heads of state have agreed to meet, I think we
can hope for a peaceful solution," said Adrienne Diop, Information
Director of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Guinean President Lansana Conte, Liberian President Charles
Taylor, along with their counterparts from Sierra Leone, Burkina
Faso, Togo and Nigeria, have just concluded an informal
consultation ahead of a formal summit.
</P>
<P>
The six presidents and the foreign ministers from Ghana and
Cote d' Ivoire arrived in the Nigerian capital Thursday to attend
the ECOWAS mini-summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to end with a formal communique, said
Nigerian officials at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Guinea has threatened retaliation against Liberia for the
allegedly killing of 28 villagers by Liberian soldiers Saturday
near the town of Macenta, on Guinean side of the two countries
borders.
</P>
<P>
But Liberia, while denying its participation in the killing,
accused Guinea of supporting Liberian rebels who last month
attacked the northern Lofa County of Liberia from Guinea.

convicted in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Japan Sign Nearly 30 Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian trade mission
headed by Prime Minister Jean Chretien signed nearly 30 deals
Thursday with Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, according to the
Canadian media.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa puts the value of the contracts, memoranda of
understanding and agreements at 409 million Canadian dollars (277
million U.S. dollars), with the seven contracts signed netting 178
million dollars (about 121 million U.S. dollars), the media said.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the signing of the deals were Chretien, 11 of his 13
provincial and territorial leaders, as well as nearly 300
businessmen, who form the massive "Team Canada" mission on a
week-long visit to Japan, the country's second largest trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
The mission is focusing on high technology, particularly in
terms of software development, biotechnology and the space
industry, the media said.
</P>
<P>
Canada intends to change its image from being a north America
country that exports only natural resources to one that has high
technology to sell to the world.
</P>
<P>
One of the successful high-tech sellers is reported to be the
Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer Bombardier, which will
complete an agreement within next four weeks on a sale of 75
million dollars (about 51 million U.S. dollars) worth of Dash-8
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In another deal, Bombardier agreed to take over the sale of
Mitsubishi's technology in airport people movers, the media said,
adding that by implementing the Mitsubishi system in North
America, Bombardier will gain its share of a market of over 3
billion dollars (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian trade mission is scheduled to end its business
tour in Japan on the weekend.

GUILIN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China suffered a dismal
Friday in the men's singles category of the China Grand Prix Table
Tennis Championships as only three home paddlers made through the
last eight and their top two players were both consigned to an
early exit.
</P>
<P>
ITTF Pro-Tour champion Wang Liqin remained the brightest hope
for China to take the gold and the 12,500 U.S. dollars prize money,
after his teammates Liu Guoliang and Ma Lin, between whom formed
the men's singles final line-up in last month's 45th world
championships, both crashed out in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, No.1 player in the ITTF rankings, went down to
compatriot Liu Guozheng 21-11, 20-22, 10-21, 17-21 while the
second-ranked Ma was the losing end of a dramatic five-set
thriller against German teenager Timo Boll.
</P>
<P>
China had been tipped to sweep the board once again after their
all-conquering performance last month in the 45th table tennis
world championships.
</P>
<P>
Wang, ranked 9th in the world, was taken to five set by his
teammate Feng Zhe in a third round match this afternoon before
romping past another teammated Qin Zhijian 21-16, 21-18, 21-8 in
the quarter-finals tonight.
</P>
<P>
Wang next clashes with teammate Liu Guozheng, which meant
tomorrow's final will not be a domestic affair since the other
semi line-up involved both non-Chinese players.
</P>
<P>
Boll, who fought a brilliant winning battle against Ma in front
of a packed partisan home crowd, later saw off Japanese opponent
Tasaki Toshio 21-19, 25-23, 21-11 to enter the semi fray.
</P>
<P>
The gutsy German will have to overcome South Korean Lee Chul
Seung, a four-set winner over veteran compatriot Yoo Nam Kyu, to
earn the chance of horning his skills against a strong Chinese
opposition in the final.
</P>
<P>
The '99 China Grand Prix, an ITTF Pro-Tour event which was
inaugurated in 1988, sees its four categories of competitions wrap

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey might get closer to
Europe if it complies with the criteria set by the European Union
(EU) for all candidate countries for membership, said Cyprus
Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to a statement by
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash that Turkey's candidacy as an
EU member will "smooth the way to a Cyprus settlement a great
deal."
</P>
<P>
The EU has said that Turkey should meet the criteria all
candidate states are asked to fulfill in order to be eligible for
accession to the 15-member union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has, among other things, to improve the human rights
situation in the country and assist efforts for a settlement of
the protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey should make a political decision to take those steps,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government believes that improvement in
Greco-Turkish relations can benefit efforts for a settlement to
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In the same way, he added, progress in the Cyprus issue will
bear a positive effect on the Greco-Turkish ties.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island in a
bi-communal federation formula, but talks between the two rival
sides have been stalled since 1997.

<HEADLINE> KLA to Become Kosovo Police Force, Says NATO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of NATO's Military
Committee, Admiral Guido Venturoni, said here Friday that the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) would partly become a police
force in the future.
</P>
<P>
The new committee chief, who took office in May, said that the
ethnic Albanian rebel group will be disbanded and transformed into
civilian societies as the deadline falls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the KLA men will be helped to find jobs and part of
them will become policemen in the province protected by the
international forces.
</P>
<P>
The KLA must disband as a military force by Sunday under an
agreement reached between the Yugoslav Government and NATO at the
end of the NATO air war against Yugoslavia in June.
</P>
<P>
The KLA hopes to transform about half of its 10,000 men into a
civilian defense corps. Rebel officials regard the corps as the
first step toward the creation of a "national army."
</P>
<P>
Some observers see this prospect has upset some western
governments, particularly those in Europe, who hold the KLA in low
regard because of doubts about its commitment to democracy and the
rule of law.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton has decided to ease sanctions against the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), allowing more trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The measure, the first since the end of the Korean War in 1953,
will allow most consumer goods to be available for export to the
DPRK and will allow the import of DPRK goods into the United
States, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on transportation, banking and personnel movements
between the U.S. and the DPRK will also be relaxed, according to
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The relaxation of transportation restrictions will allow
commercial air and sea transportation between the U.S. and North
Korea for passengers and cargo, subject to normal regulatory
requirements," he announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the condition for the easing of
sanctions was linked to a pledge by the DPRK that it "will
continue to refrain from testing long-range missiles of any kind
as both sides move toward more normal relations."

<HEADLINE> Comilla Congress of Environmental Journalists Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The four-day congress of
environment journalists from Asia-Pacific and Commonwealth
?:
countries ended on Friday with pledges for greater cooperation
among newsmen for awareness development.
</P>
<P>
The joint Congress of Asia-Pacific Forum of Environmental
Journalists (AFEJ) and Commonwealth Environmental Journalists
Association (CEJA) on the media role on water was held in Comilla,
about 200 kilometers to the Southeast of Dhaka. Experts and
representatives of environmental watchdogs from some 30 countries
also attended the meeting, according to reports reaching here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed issues related to water, one of the
most crucial resources of the current and future world, and
exchanged views on the strategies to strengthen the role of the
media as an active agent for awareness development.
</P>
<P>
"The theme of this international congress of environment
journalists is very time befitting as it has now appeared as one
of the most crucial issues for development of Bangladesh as well
as many other countries, " Bangladesh Secretary of the Forest and
Environment Ministry Syed Marghum Murshed told the concluding
session of the congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that environmental problems in their entirety are
global problems and therefore need international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rezaul Karim, chief of Environment Section of the
Bangkok-based UN-ESCAP (The Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and Pacific), said the environment journalists now are faced
with three major challenges of understanding the difficult
environmental issues, awareness generation and using the
information technology.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization has always been with environmental
journalists as it considered the media role to be very effective
for protection of environment.
</P>
<P>
The new president of AFEJ, Dr. Dharman Wickramaratne of Sri
Lanka, said the congress achieved a major breakthrough for the
environmental journalists of the Asia-Pacific and Commonwealth
nations as the CEJA adopted its first constitution and the AFEJ
strengthened its organizational networks.
</P>
<P>
The next joint congress of the AFEJ and CEJA will be held in
45
June 2000, in the Pacific Island of Fiji.

or key documents to members of Congress investigating his decision
to grant clemency to Pueto Rican nationalists, raising tensions
between the White House and a Republican-led Congress that is
showing a renewed appetite for probing the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
-- An early morning truck bomb blast killed 17 people in the
southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, deepening a political and
public crisis as the country's leaders struggled to respond to a
string of three similar terrorist bombings in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

weakening course up the Atlantic coast.
</P>

The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. industrial output climbed 0.3% in August for the

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Stage Photo Exhibitions to Celebrate National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) is going to stage a series of
district photo exhibitions, marking the golden jubilee of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
According to a government release issued on Friday, the
exhibitions, part of the civic education program co-ordinated by
the Steering Committee on Education/Cultural Activities in
celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People'
s Republic of China, will be shown at over 40 venues in 18
districts.
</P>
<P>
The approach of the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic
and the advent of the new millennium will trigger off a chain of
celebration activities which will also remind us of the importance
of enhancing our understanding of the motherland," said a
government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitions will highlight the theme "China into the
Millennium" with a rich display of photographs portraying the
history and development of China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "By acquiring a better knowledge of China,
it is hoped that the public, in particular the youth, will foster
a stronger sense of identity with China and belonging to Hong Kong
which would in turn encourage more active participation in the
community affairs and contribute to the implementation of the 'one
country, two systems' concept."
</P>
<P>
Most of the district exhibitions will start on Saturday,
leading up to the main exhibition at the Hong Kong Cultural Center
to be officiated by Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of HKSAR, on

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Increase Despite Rising Mortgage Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce
Department said Friday that new construction of houses and
apartments in the country increased 0.4 percent in August despite
rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
U.S. builders started new homes at a seasonally adjusted rate
of 1.68 million units last month, the department reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that housing climbed 3.9 percent in July,
recovering from a slide of 3.7 percent in June. Both monthly
revised estimates were smaller than first reported.
</P>
<P>
Last month, new construction on single-family homes fell 1.3
percent to an annual rate of 1.3 million units, following a rise
of 1.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Construction of condos and apartment buildings, however, jumped
6.6 percent last month, adding to a huge 15.6 percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have been expecting that rising interest rates could
dampen the market for new-home sales.
</P>
<P>
After a record housing boom last year fueled by exceptionally
low mortgage costs, interest rates have been inching back up in
1999. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage hit this year's high
of 8.15 percent in mid-August. Rates have settled back a bit since
then, and averaged 7.82 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
However, builders report that shortages of skilled workers and
construction materials such as brick and wallboard have been a
bigger factor in slowing construction as strong demand for new
homes continues.
</P>
<P>
For August, housing rose in every region of the country except
the west, where they fell by 7.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 403,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gain was in the Midwest, where housing jumped 8.5
percent to an annual rate of 343,000 units.
</P>
<P>
New building permits, which are considered as a gauge of future
construction, dropped 1.8 percent in August, after being unchanged
in July.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Clinton Preparing to Relax Sanctions on DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton is preparing to announce a relaxation of trade and
investment sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), following its agreement to refrain from further ballistic
missile testing, the White House said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the action would be
announced at the White House and State Department.
</P>
<P>
He said it would involve "trade and investment rather than
something sweeping and broad."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's move grows out of a tentative agreement reached in
Berlin last week between the United States and the DPRK. The
United States said the DPRK had agreed not to conduct long-range
missile tests as long as it was holding talks with Washington.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said that the easing would most visibly affect
basic consumer goods, such as home electronics, but that strict
controls would remain over goods that could also be used in
weapons manufacturing.

items in leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is triumphant in a
one-man show by turning a page of history of Algeria in conformity
with the will of all across the nation. The referendum on national
reconciliation held on Thursday will not only reinforce his
legitimacy but also bring about a real hope of peace in the
country ravaged by seven years of violence.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia saw on Thursday the fifth bombing attacks in three
weeks. In Bolgodonsk in the southwest, an explosion killed 17
people, bringing the number of the killed to 292 since August 31.
Meanwhile, the authorities said they foiled six attacks in Moscow
in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Algerians were strongly mobilized on Thursday to approve
through referendum the project of "civil concord" of President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who wants to end rapidly more than seven
years of civil war. In the capital Algiers as well as regions
considered to be strongholds of Islamists, people voted massively.
Only in Kabylie, a Berber-speaking mountainous region in the north,
only 30 percent of the people voted.
</P>
<P>
-- A new book written by historian John Cornwell has relaunched
a debate about the political personality of Pope Pius VII, who
Cornwell said was sympathetic with Hitler and anti-Semitic by
remaining silent in the face of Holocaust. Some historians have
rejected the argument, describing it as a campaign against the
Roman Catholic Church with intentional anti-truth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Be More Determined on Solving Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Friday expressed belief that the U.S. will show more
determination in solving the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival in New York to address the
U.N. General Assembly, Clerides urged the U.S. to exert more
pressure on the Turkish side to make Ankara change its
intransigent position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their Cologne summit in June, asked U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to invite leaders of the two communities to unconditional
negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said he expects to be invited to talks in the last
two weeks of October. However, the format of the talks has not
been decided so far.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said he will not accept any proposal for talks with
the participation of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities,
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to that effect had been turned down by the Turkish
Cypriot side, the Cyprus government said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If Ankara goes to the negotiating table and is ready to discuss
a solution within the framework defined by the U.N., that will
constitute an indication of substantive progress, said the
president.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has set
up a task force to ensure food and medicine supply for thousands
of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Afghanistan with
cooperation of NGOs.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen Friday here, U.N. officials Stephanie Bunker
and Paul Clarke said that 80,000 to 85,000 persons have been
displaced in northern Afghanistan and 15,000 to 20,000 out of them
are shelterless.
</P>
<P>
According to a rough estimate, 6,000 metric tons of food will
be needed only for the IDPs in northern Afghanistan in the coming
winter.
</P>
<P>
They made it clear that the U.N. Food Program will have to face
serious difficulties in reaching the areas during the winter so
food supply must be ensured before the beginning of winter to save
the lives of thousands of IDPs.
</P>
<P>
Making a statement about the IDPs of Kabul, they said about
55,000 IDPs are living in the capital of Afghanistan and more than
12,000 IDPs have sought shelter in the compound of the Russian
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
They said the U.N. is making all efforts to assess the actual
need of food items and medicine of IDPs to meet their requirement
because the IDPs are not only in Kabul and northern areas of the
country but are also residing in Kunduz, Takhar and Baghlan
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Summit Signs Agreement to Ease Guinea-Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders Friday
reached an agreement in Nigeria's capital Abuja in a bid to
prevent the row between Liberia and Guinea from escalating and
destabilizing the region.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's President Charles Taylor and Guinean President
Lansana Conte signed the agreement after an overnight talk, along
with their counterparts from S. Leone, Burkina Faso, Togo and
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The presidents attending the meeting "urged the heads of state
of Guinea and Liberia to establish direct communication lines,"
said a final statement released at the end of the mini- summit of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Key points on the document include the exchange of a list of
known dissidents by Liberia, Guinea and S. Leone with a view to
their expulsion, setting up a joint security committee and
reviving of the Mano River Union economic group, which has been
mired in years of turmoil.  "The main problem was lack of
communication," said ECOWAS Information Director Adrienne Diop.
</P>
<P>
"They were acting on rumors of this and that, so the setting up
of a joint committee will mean they are both there and they can
take joint action," according to reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Liberia and Guinea's recent conflict is
shadowed by their leaders' long-time feud.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian civil war launched by Talor in 1989, which ended
with his election to the presidency in 1997, had spilled over to
S. Leone and more than once threatened Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other French-speaking countries in the region, Guinea
joined with former British colonies in the Nigerian-dominated
ECOMOG force which Taylor blamed for stopping him taking power
back in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Guinea threatened retaliation recently against Liberia for the
allegedly killing of 28 villagers by Liberian intruders on
Saturday near its border town of Macenta.
</P>
<P>
But Liberia, while denying this charge, accused Guinea of
supporting Liberian rebels who last month attacked the Liberian
north county Lofa.

<HEADLINE> China Worried of Olympic Prospects in Rowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese sports
authories are worried of the Olympic prospect in rowing as no
budding stars emerged in the fourth Chinese City Games.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in any mood of celebration as no star stands up in
the City Games, and we're clearly short of the athletes of
potentials for the 2004 Olympic Games," said Xin Qunying,
assistant director of the Chinese Aquatic Sports Administrative
Center, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
For the City Games, a cradle for future stars, only those aged
between 16-19 are eligible for the rowing competitions.
</P>
<P>
"They are supposed to be the main force of potentials to strike
for the medals in the 2004 Olympics, but it showed that we still
have a long way to win our first rowing gold medal in the Olympics,
" said the assistant director.
</P>
<P>
Most of the competitors are not high enough in height, and "
physical advantages can play a critical, although not a decisive,
role in the world arena," explained director Xin.
</P>
<P>
The delusion that body height is not important in rowing, may
stem from the fact that Zhang Xiuyun, a 1.78-meter woman rower,
became China's first world rowing champion and finished second in
the Atlanta Olympic Games, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we had failed to pay enough attention in body
height in our choose of rowing athletes of potentials in the past
years," said Xin.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, our coaches are also short of scientific training
methods with little knowledge of mechanics and ship-building,"
said the Chinese rowing official.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Muslims Return to New Homes in Old Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- On an ordinary morning on
ordinary street in Beijing, a group of Chinese Muslims wearing the
traditional white cap, can be heard greeting each other in their
ethnic language, which sounds a bit strange in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
But, today is the day they are returning to their original
community, Niu Jie street, in southwestern Beijing, where their
families have lived for more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, when the government tore down the old housing to put
up modern apartment buildings, they had to move out temporarily
and now the new residences are ready.
</P>
<P>
By 8:00 a.m., their numbers began increasing and more than a
thousand gathered in front of several 18-story apartment buildings.
The move back had a sort of holiday atmosphere, with clusters of
balloons, an army band playing, and girls dancing and singing.
Imama Haji Iberahin arrives, saying that this is the biggest day
in Niu Jie's history.
</P>
<P>
The government held a short ceremony to welcome the residents
back, and Liu Qi, Beijing's mayor whom people in the community get
acquainted with only on TV screen, handed over keys to the flats.
</P>
<P>
Muhamud Ali, a 68-year-old cake peddler, said that he had never
imagined he would live in a such a big apartment, one with a
balcony. He said his nine-member family had become accustomed to
living in a 19-square-meter slum dwelling. The new apartment is
nearly five times the size of that place.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever it rained, my roof leaked. We had to keep three
basins to catch the rainwater, and my children had no place to do
homework," Fatirmel, a retired woman, said of the old days. "But
now those worries are over," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was quite common in the 1.39-sq.km. Muslim community in
Beijing for most of the 58,000 Muslims used to live in simple
rooms built a century ago, without any bathroom and heating
facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Luerdin, Fatirmel's husband, the most convenient
thing is the bathroom in the new apartment. He has to wash five
times a day before going to the mosque, but in the old days, he
had to do that in public bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
He shows his three-room apartment to visitors, saying that the
designers have even used colors favored by Muslims. The building
is painted yellow with green trim.
</P>
<P>
Workers did not make any changes to the mosque on Niu Jie,
which was built in 996 A.D. and just added a bit of grass yard to
beautify it. The shops and restaurants that sell beef and mutton
have been preserved.
</P>
<P>
"We Muslims like to live together," Ali said, "There is the
food we are used to, and there are mosques and Muslim schools. Our
children can continue to speak our language."
</P>
<P>
Some people from the Han nationality also come from neighboring
communities to greet the return of their Muslim neighbors. "We're
glad that the friendly Muslims are back here," said Yang Mulan, a
woman among them.

PHNOM PENH, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) will provide Cambodia with a loan of 20 million U.S. dollars
under an agreement signed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support the country's water supply and
sewage treatment projects.
</P>
<P>
With the new loan, the ADB has offered a total of 88 million
U.S. dollars of loans to Cambodia so far this year, compared with
40 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, Cambodia has received from the ADB a total of 233
million U.S. dollars for various projects in such areas as
agriculture, irrigation works, roads and education. But the ADB
had interrupted its loan program in 1997 due to the political
turmoil in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
At present, only 29 percent of the households in the country
have access to safe drinking water.

<HEADLINE>   Mindanao Troops Sufficient to Go After Criminals: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
in the southern island of Mindanao are sufficient to go after
criminals and rebels in the area, Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said there is no plan to beef up troops in the south,
despite the recent abduction of some teachers in Basilan, an
island province across the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula in
western Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We see no need to augment our troops. Our present forces are
sufficient," Philippine News Agency quoted the defense secretary
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Armed Forces there are now going after
extremist dissidents believed to be behind the abduction of the
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, suspected extremists kidnapped a four-year-old girl
in Basilan, prompting weeks of rescue operations that inflicted
heavy casualties on the dissidents' side and ended with the
victim's safe release.
</P>
<P>
"It's really unfortunate, I mean, Basilan is still one of our
major headaches at present," Mercado added.

<HEADLINE> China to Complete Beijing-based Nuclear Reactor Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China will finish
construction of its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (
HTGR) next year in Beijing in an effort to ease the energy
shortage in the new millennium, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
This means that China will become the fifth country to build
the HTGR, the latest model adopted by the most advanced nuclear
stations in developed countries, following Britain, the United
States, Germany and Japan, according to sources with the Institute
of Nuclear Energy of Qinghua University which is responsible for
designing and building the project.
</P>
<P>
The 10-megawatt reactor, which has been under construction
since 1995, is 40 kilometers from downtown Beijing, almost at the
foot of the Great Wall. Sources said that it will not be used to
provide electricity to the Chinese capital, but will serve as a
base for testing the next generation of nuclear technologies and
to train experts.
</P>
<P>
Using helium as its coolant, the HTGR is a safe and effective
energy source brought about by a chain fission reaction of uranium.
It has a very high safety rate because the reactor can
automatically shut down the operation if an accident occurs, and
excess heat can be removed. This safety advantage allows it to be
built in populous residential areas to better serve communities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is one of the most effective and cheapest power
generators, as its electricity-generation rate is about 45 percent,
and it can be used to build a nuclear power station in a period of
two years. The cost of building a HTGR is just half that required
for building a water reactor.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of the HTGR in Beijing shows that China has
entered a higher stage of using nuclear power in a peaceful way,"
said Ruan Keqian, an academician at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and a key member of China's energy research group.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear industry took shape in the 1950s, and the
country set off its first nuclear bomb in 1964. In the early 1980s,
the central government decided that the industry's focus should be
shifted from military purposes to the production of civilian
products.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this decade, China has been operating two commercial
nuclear power stations, in Qinshan of Zhejiang Province and the
Daya Bay in Shenzhen City, respectively. Construction of the
second and third phases of the Qinshan and Ling'ao nuclear power
stations and the Lianyungang nuclear power plant are in now full
swing.
</P>
<P>
However, all these nuclear plants have relied on international
cooperation for key equipment and related technology, and this has
increased the cost of nuclear power, pushing its price much higher
than that of both thermal and hydro-electric power.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, China announced it will not start any new
nuclear power projects for three years because of declining demand
for power supplies with the closure of a string of state-owned
enterprises, and other factors.
</P>
<P>
"However, this does not mean bleak prospects for nuclear power
development in China," Shen Wenquan, director of the Nuclear Power
Department under the China Nuclear Industry Corp., noted, adding
that the decline in demand for electric power is just temporary
and that, conversely, there will be a shortage of power for quite
a long time.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by 60 research institutes and ministries shows
that China will face a shortage of 600 million tons of oil by the
year 2050 if the economy continues to develop at its current pace.
The nuclear power generating capacity should be 200 million
kilowatts by that time.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that the country's nuclear power
should contribute about five percent of China's total power output
by the year 2020, some four percent more than at present. The
ratio of nuclear power in the world's total power output is 17
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission is now working out an
overall nuclear power development plan aimed at bringing the
country's nuclear power generating capacity up to 20 million
kilowatts by 2010, according to Shen.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen provinces, including populous Shandong,
Fujian, Hainan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Sichuan, are all
actively preparing to build their own nuclear power stations, the
official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
inspected the new terminal at Beijing's Capital International
Airport here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, made the inspection on his arrival back from a
state visit to Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, and after
attending the 7th APEC Informal Leadership Meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the completion of the new
facility on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China, which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
He instructed departments of civil aviation and airport
management to always give top priority to safety, and improve

</P>
<P>
The project, with a total investment of 9.18 billion yuan (1.1
billion U.S. dollars), includes a new terminal building, a large-
scale parking building, and a cargo station.
</P>
<P>
The new terminal building, three times larger than the current
one, covers 336,000 square meters and is equipped with state-of-
the-art facilities. It is four stories high, including one
underground, and the main entryway is about 339 meters long and 28
meters high.
</P>
<P>
With the new terminal in full operation, the airport will be
able to handle 35 million passengers, 780,000 tons of cargo and
mail, and 190,000 flights a year.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by director of the General Administration of Civil
Aviation of China, Liu Jianfeng, Jiang went from the terminal to
Customs lanes and other facilities. He also talked with airport
workers.
</P>
<P>
A good airport should provide better services and more
conveniences to passengers, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked airport officials to prepare fully for the
terminal's operation and ensure the smooth transfer from the old
terminal to the new.
</P>
<P>

LUANDA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Angola
(BNA) has vowed to protect the interests of enterprises and
individuals in the possible monetary reform, official Jornal de
Angola reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of BNA Aguinaldo Jaime said, "whatever decision the
government makes, nobody will be prejudiced in their credits and
there will be no confiscation of the banking savings of
enterprises and individuals."
</P>
<P>
He also asked people not to exchange their readjusted kwanza,
the national currency, for foreign currencies, saying that "nobody
will be prejudiced in the quantity of the money that they have at
this moment."
</P>
<P>
The bank has reiterated that the people should accept the legal
currency in force, blaming that some economic operators, being
afraid of possible prejudice in the monetary reform and the fast
devaluation of the national currency, have refused to accept the
payment in readjusted kwanza.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the Council of Ministers ending
Thursday in the capital city of Luanda, Jaime said that the
government has not yet made a decision of reforming the current
monetary system.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue of changing the note or not is now
under research and there is no political decision in this respect.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to reports from Algiers on Friday morning, 98.63
percent of Algerian voters have voted for the "law of civil
concord" proposed by Bouteflika to offer clemency to most
Islamists involved in the seven years of civil war with government
forces, in which more than 100,000 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The participation rate of Algerian voters was also a record
high of 85.06 percent, reinforcing the legitimacy of the
reconciliation plan.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika now has a free hand to implement his policy he
presented after coming to power in mid April.
</P>
<P>
He intends to pardon or alleviate punishment for all Islamic
militants except those who have killed, raped or staged bombing
attacks in public places.
</P>
<P>
He also offers total or partial clemency for Islamic guerrillas
who surrender to the government before January 13 next year.
</P>
<P>
A relentless punishment will be given to those who refuse to
surrender and a maximum 20-year jail sentence will be applied to
those who have committed crimes of blood.
</P>
<P>
Two most radical Islamic groups, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA)
and the Salafist Group for Prediction and Combat, which have from
5,000 to 7,000 militants, have rejected the clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
Another armed Islamic group, the Islamic Salvation Army, which
has about 3,000 militants, has surrendered.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Privatization to Boost Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's first phase of
privatization is expected to earn the government 19 billion naira
(20 million U.S. dollars), the Guardian, a leading Nigerian
newspaper, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the ambassadors-designates in Abuja, Vice President
Atiku Abubakar said the money will be generated when the
government sells its equity shares ranging from 10 percent to 40
percent in the companies already listed on the Lagos Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will further boost its revenue in the
second phase of the privatization when hotels and vehicle assembly
plants will be fully privatized, as it intends to sell off its
equity holdings from 35 percent to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the government coffers will swell at the third
phase when public utilities, refineries and fertilizer plants with
their equity totally owned by the government are partially
privatized, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government has put in place in-built mechanisms that will
ensure that stock exchange shares are made available up to local
government levels in order to safeguard the interest of all
citizens", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that government would involve international
privatization advisers in certain areas where complex and
sophisticated activities were to be undertaken.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program, with an aim to raise the efficiency
of the country's economy, began in September. It is expected to
involve the full privatization of 25 enterprises, partial
privatization of 36 enterprises and the partial commercialization
of nine enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists claimed
here today that they have discovered a total of 172 cardiovascular-
disease-related new genes, which could lead to more effective
diagnosis and treatment of the mankind's No. 1 killer.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries have been registered at the GenBank of the U.S.

of the heart and aorta.
</P>
<P>
He said the function of the genes and their relationship to
cardiovascular diseases are being researched.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary research indicates that some genes may have close
connections with degenerated and dead cardiac muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
There are 50,000 to 100,000 human genes, 2,000 of which relate
to diseases, with 200 directly related to cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-German research center, also attached to Fuwai
Hospital, the most famous in China for its cardiovascular disease
treatment, has established a series of quotas for gene diagnosis
of cardiovascular diseases, by which doctors can determine who is
the most likely to suffer from a specific cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
The center is looking for Chinese and overseas partners to
jointly launch research and development of pharmaceuticals and
reagents for genetic diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> "China Has a Great Future": Australian Deputy Speaker of House (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Speaker of the House
of Representatives of Australia, Garry Nehl, is visiting China for
the fourth time in 11 years and is still amazed at the great
changes here in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his overall impression of the country, Nehl said, "
China has a great future."
</P>
<P>
He is now visiting just as people are preparing to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
The deputy speaker returned to Beijing Thursday from his four-
day visit to Tibet, his second since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Traveling to Lhasa, Xigaze, and other places in Tibet, Nehl
said he could hardly recognize the places he visited during his
previous trip.
</P>
<P>
"I have been amazed at the progress and development in so many
areas," said Nehl, noting the vast number of new buildings and new
schools, the construction of hydropower stations and the extension
of electricity to rural Tibetan villagers.
</P>
<P>
Equally important, said the deputy speaker, are the efforts
made by local authorities to plant trees along riverbanks to
control erosion, and in little fields to serve as wind-brakes,
which indicate that the people have developed "an environmental
consciousness."
</P>
<P>
On a journey to Shannan in Tibet, Nehl and his companions had a
little picnic lunch, after which the Chinese people picked up
every little scrap of rubbish, and the roads were clean of litter,
as well.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Algerian Referendum Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Friday that the result of the referendum on a
national reconciliation law held in Algeria reflects "the immense
expectations" of the Algerian people.
</P>
<P>
"This voting results reflect the immense expectations of the
Algerian people and strengthens the authority of President (
Abdelaziz) Bouteflika," said Vedrine on radio Europe 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the trust of the people, Bouteflika will
implement more quickly and in a more concrete way his plan for
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is ready to support what he called "the new
Algeria which is standing face-to-face with us."
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Algerian President
Bouteflika will meet next Tuesday in New York on the sidelines of
the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
More than 98 percent of Algerians voted for the national
reconciliation law in a referendum Thursday.

Lhasa, he said, was so different from when he last saw it in
1992 that he would almost think it was another city.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the cleanness of the streets, the vast boom of
traffic and tourism was also striking, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In 1992, transportation in Lhasa consisted of no more than a
few tricycles; but now I saw taxis everywhere," he said. "I was
absolutely amazed by the number of tourists," said the deputy
speaker, relating that hordes of visitors queued before almost
every flight of stairs in the magnificent Potala Palace in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
He said he found no evidence of religious oppression, noting
that he saw monks in the Potala freely engaging in normal
religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
Men, women, and children were seen in their characteristic
ethnic costumes. "It's self-evident to anybody who cares to look
that there is no oppression whatsoever," said Nehl, refuting
statement about ethnic oppression in Tibet as "absolutely nonsense.
"
</P>
<P>
"I can see that China's growth and development is taking place,
" he said, "you have to take the Chinese situation in its own
context."
</P>
<P>
"The development is massive," he said. "In 50 years' time,
China is going to be a vastly different country than the one it is
now."

<HEADLINE> Agreement to Solve Guinea-Liberia Conflict Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders Friday
reached an agreement at a summit in Nigerian capital Abuja to
prevent the row between Liberia and Guinea from escalating and
destabilizing the region.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor and Guinean President
Lansana Conte signed the document along with their counterparts
from Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Togo and Nigeria after an
overnight talk.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "urged the heads of state of Guinea and Liberia to
establish direct communication lines between them," said a final
statement released at the end of the mini-summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Other key points in the agreement include the exchange of a
list of known dissidents by Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone with
a view to their expulsion, setting up a joint security committee
and reviving of the Mano River Union economic group.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem was lack of communication," said ECOWAS
Information Director Adrienne Diop.
</P>
<P>
"They were acting on rumors of this and that, so the setting up
of a joint committee will mean they are both there and they can
take joint action," Diop said.
</P>
<P>
Guinea threatened to retaliate against Liberia for the
allegedly killing of 28 villagers by Liberian intruders on
Saturday near its border town of Macenta.
</P>
<P>
But Liberia, while denying this charge, accused Guinea of
supporting Liberian rebels who last month attacked Liberia's north
county Lofa.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian civil war launched by Taylor in 1989, which ended
with his election as the president in 1997, had threatened
security of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other French-speaking countries in the region, Guinea
joined with former British colonies in the Nigerian-dominated
ECOMOG force which Taylor blamed for stopping him taking power
back in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Foreign Debts Up to 10 Billion U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, one of the
poorest countries in the world, has owed 10 billion U.S. dollars
foreign debt, according to the latest issue of Ethiopian weekly
Press Digest.
</P>
<P>
On the list of African debtor countries, Ethiopia stands fifth.
The total debts of African countries is 350 billion U.S. dollars,
the weekly quoted New Africa Magazine as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of all debt owed by Ethiopia, more than two billion U.S.
dollars belongs to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, local financial sources said, all of this debt is
owed to the International Development Association, the soft-loan
affiliate of the World Bank Group, which extends to poor
developing countries concessional credits with almost negligible
interest costs and long maturity and grace periods.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Streets Light Up for 50th National Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The streets of Beijing have
been lit up to create a festive mood in the Chinese capital for
the upcoming celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
Fu Bonan, head of the municipal civil building management board,
announced at today's news briefing that the work of lighting up
the city has made notable achievements.
</P>
<P>
All the illumination projects for major streets, lawns,
advertising billboards, and other man-made scenes have been
completed, featuring both traditional and modern characteristics,
Fu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the scenic lighting downtown is
centered on Chang'an Avenue and the Tian'anmen Square area, major
ancient buildings, landmark buildings, and important commercial
streets.
</P>
<P>
The Monument to the People's Heroes will be the brightest
structure in Tian'anmen, the center of the capital. At the same
time, all the lights along Chang'an Avenue and the Ring Roads have
been upgraded.
</P>
<P>
The lighting at the Imperial Palace has been completely
renovated, and modern equipment is being used for the first time,
with special approval from the government, to make the Forbidden
City even more mysterious, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The brand-new illumination system will be in full use from
September 18-22, and during the festive days celebrating the
National Day, which falls on October 1, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
During the festival, people will have a splendid view of
Beijing wherever they are, even if they get a bird's-eye peek at
the city from an airplane, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the lighting system has been designed as a
three-level one in order to save energy and reduce costs, and
different groups of lights will be utilized for different levels
of events.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Reject Kabila's Invitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The main rebel movement in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo has rejected President
Laurent Kabila's invitation to go to Kinshasa for a national
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
''It is not safe to go to Kinshasa, you never know what might
happen once you get there,'' Moise Nyarugabo, vice-president of
the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), told Rwandan News Agency
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kabila is a man who does not keep his word, given
the fact he threw into prison even his allies and former Mobutists
who had rallied him.
</P>
<P>
Nyarugabo said that the principle of national dialogue has been
agreed upon, but that Kabila was not the one to decide who was
going to be invited,
</P>
<P>
and where the dialogue would be held.
</P>
<P>
''It is a good thing that the conference should be held on the
Congolese territory. We propose Kindu, a town in the centre of the
country, and we grant him (Kabila) maximum security,'' Nyarugabo
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that over 40 people were killed in
the past two weeks, in south of Bukavu province in a spate of
attacks carried out by Mai Mai fighters, Rwandan Hutu
"Interahamwe" militia, and Burundi Hutu rebels.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has a clear
plan of action on the economic and financial system issues to
ensure justice at the global level, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
Albar said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad would raise the

</P>
<P>
"I think we will have to look at the future of the world
economic and financial systems," he was quoted by Bernama news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Malaysia wished to ensure there was no
oppression of the developing countries by the developed ones in
various fields including in the area of the so-called free trade.
</P>
<P>
"They (developed countries) have protection systems in the name
of free trade and do not open up their market to us...we will
stress more on economic issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was of the view that currency speculators should
be eliminated as they could damage the economies of developing
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher for
the first time in three trading days in Tokyo on Friday, helped by
a rebound of the U.S. dollar against the yen on expectations for
joint currency market intervention.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
banned all doctors, clinical officers and nurses in public service
from engaging in private practice, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Amukowa Anangwe, Health Minister in charge of medical services,
Thursday announced that doctors, nurses and clinical officers who
want to operate their own clinics should quit government jobs.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe made the remarks in Kakamega District in Kenya's
Western Province as he presented a golden badge, certificates and
a cash award to Felister Muriithi, a registered nurse of Kakamega
Provincial General Hospital and the winner of the National Nurse
of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that only consultants would be allowed to
engage in private practice, noting that some of the medics were
abandoning their public duties to pay more attention to their
private work.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary: Fight Separatist Attempt to The End  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency today
released a commentator's article titled "Fight Lee Teng-hui's
Separatist Attempt to the End."
</P>
<P>
The article said the Chinese government and people have
launched a series of fights against Lee Teng-hui since he made the
"two state" remarks on July 9.
</P>
<P>
The international community has also reaffirmed their "One
China" stand, and the intention of the separatist forces led by
Lee to amend the "constitution" at the "Third National Assembly"
was totally crushed.
</P>
<P>
"Struggles during the past two months clearly show that the
Chinese government and people will not tolerate the open
provocations of the separatist forces led by Lee," says the
commentator, adding, "We have the ability and determination to
safeguard the territorial integrity and sovereignty of China, and
our war is inviolable, just and forceful."
</P>
<P>
The "two state" remarks are a serious fallacy aimed at
splitting China, the commentator points out. Lee's remarks are an
open provocation to the "one China" policy, and destroyed the
basis for cross-Straits dialogue, as well as the peaceful
reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people gave a quick reaction to Lee'
s remarks, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out on July
18, during a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, that Lee has taken a dangerous step, which has exposed
his intention to split China. Jiang said there is only one China
in the world and Taiwan is part of China. He warned the Taiwan
side to stop all separatist activities at once.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin stressed that China has never promised
not to use force to take back Taiwan during his meeting on Sept.
11 with U.S. President Clinton at the 7th informal meeting of
leaderships of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

<TEXT>
<P>
People of all walks in China slammed Lee Teng-hui's "two state"
remarks, and people in Taiwan also showed their worry about the
tension in cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The commentator points out that Lee's "two state" remarks was
intended to destroy the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
Region, and even in the world. Therefore, the international
community called Lee a "troublemaker."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, over 100 countries including the United States,
Japan and Russia, have reiterated their "one China" stance.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Communist Party of China's (CPC) Central Committee and the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council refuted Lee Teng-hui's
separatist remarks on July 20.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the divisive forces in Taiwan are
attempting to revise the so-called "constitution" and "laws" of
Taiwan in line with the "two state" concept, to realize the "
independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
They warned the divisive forces in Taiwan to stop playing with
fire, and called on people of insight in Taiwan to distance
themselves from Lee's line and make contributions to the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
But Lee Teng-hui still insisted on his "two state" remarks, and
even wanted to seek a legal basis for them.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that Lee has underestimated the Chinese
government's and the Chinese people's determination to safeguard
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and it emphasizes
that Lee's separatist attempts are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"We Chinese people have the determination and ability to smash
the splittist force's provocation and protect the sovereignty of
China, and accomplish the country's peaceful reunification process,
" the commentary concludes.

<HEADLINE> First Consignment of International Aid For Refugees Arrives in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Two cargo planes chartered by
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in
Dili, capital of East Timor, on Friday, carrying 10 tons of food
supplies and medicine for East Timor refugees.
</P>
<P>
Head of the ICRC's East Timor affairs unit Cymeon Antoulas said
the two planeloads constituted the first package of international
humanitarian assistance to arrive in Dili.
</P>
<P>
More aid would follow later, Antoulas was quoted by the Antara
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The aid would be distributed among thousands of refugees
currently living in deprivation in the hilly areas around Dili.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
staffer Christian Koch said his organization was planning to help
the refugees with health and sanitation assistance.
</P>
<P>
Asked about aid for refugees in Atambua (a town in East Nusa
Tenggara province located close to its border with East Timor),
Koch said UNHCR assistance would not go to them pending the
completion of negotiations about the matter between UNHCR and
Indonesian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 East Timorese are believed to be in East Nusa
Tenggara following last month's direct ballot which showed support
for East Timor's independence over autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Indonesian Army was reported to have sent
seven tons of rice to Dili's Dare and Dekora villages where about
15,000 refugees were known to have sought shelter.
</P>
<P>
However, it was believed the Army's assistance would be
insufficient.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Discuss Final-Status Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met secretly Thursday
night in Ramallah, discussing negotiations for a permanent peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
David Ziso, Barak's spokesman, confirmed that the holding of
the meeting, but could not give details. Israel Radio said the
meeting last several hours.
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo has been appointed head of the Palestinian delegation for
the final-status talks that started on September 13 to deal with
the thorny issues of nature and borders of the Palestinian entity,
the fate of Jerusalem and millions of Palestinian refugees, and
the future of Jewish settlements. Israel has yet to name the head
of its delegation.
</P>
<P>
Israelis and Palestinians at last got down to the final-status
talks under a revised peace deal for the Wye Accord signed on
September 5 in Egyptian Rea Sea Resort of Sharm El Sheikh after
weeks of agonizing negotiations and two false starts in 1996 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the new deal, the two sides will work out a
statement of principles within five months and a lasting peace
treaty should be reached by September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
As a continuation of the Wye Accord, the new deal envisages
that Israel is to turn over another 11 percent of the West Bank to
Palestinian, bringing the lands in the West Bank and Gaza under
Palestinian full and partial control to a little more than 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Israel has carried out the first of the three land transfers,
handing over 7 percent of the territory in the West Bank. The
Palestinian side, in return, had handed over the list of its
police force to the Israeli side according to the new deal which
asks the Palestinians to reduce its police force.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Get Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
announced that Tanzania is qualified for debt relief under the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, a goal that the
country has tried to achieve for years.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank has determined that Tanzania is eligible for
HIPC," James Adams, the bank's country director for Tanzania and
Uganda, was quoted as saying by The Guardian newspaper on Friday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Tanzania will have a HIPC agreement in
place and very shortly thereafter, it will receive a significant
amount of resources to pay its external debt, Adams said in Dar es
Salaam Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Adams praised the Tanzanian government for sound fiscal
management, maintaining a steady exchange rate and continuing the
economic liberalization process that started in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's fiscal deficit stands at between two and three
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with over seven
percent in 1995, while its inflation is in single digit, against
around 29 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
One of the poorest countries in the world, Tanzania's external
debt hovers around eight billion U.S. dollars, with a
debt-to-export ratio of 290 percent. This is expected to fall to
between 150 percent and 200 percent after receiving HIPC funds,
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
If Tanzania can substantially reduce its external debt, more
money can be used to fund its health and education services, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, who is on a
working visit to the United States, held crucial talks with
President of the World Bank James Wolfensohn in Washington D.C. on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa is scheduled to meet the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Director Michael Camdessus on the HIPC issue.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Settlement Possible in Five Months: Denktas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas has said that a settlement to the 36-year-old Cyprus
problem could come within five months if the international
community treats the two sides on the island as equals.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Turkish Daily News published
on Friday, Denktas said that as long as the Greek Cypriot side
continued to be accorded the title of the sole government of the
entire island, they would not feel the need to compromise.
</P>
<P>
He said that a settlement on the island would become possible
if talks were held on the basis of equality between the island's
two states.
</P>
<P>
Denktas said that the U.S. officials he met in Washington and
New York recently "must have definitely understood" what could not
be done in Cyprus, stressing that he did not expect them to
abandon what he described as "the mission impossible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Denktas expressed his pleasure over the flare of
affection and feelings of friendship between the Turkish and Greek
peoples in the aftermath of the 7.4-magnitude earthquake on August
17, which hit western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that neither Turkey nor Greece should be
expected to change their "national policies" because of the
friendship and affection between their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Hi-Tech's Impact on International Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua)-- A senior Chinese strategist
said here today that the rapid development of information and
biological technology is having a profound impact on
international strategy and national security.
</P>
<P>
High-technology's prominent impact on the development of
military equipment will also deeply affect the future of warfare,
said Xie Guang, senior advisor at the China Institute for
International Strategic Studies (CIISS) and former vice minister
in charge of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defense.
</P>
<P>
Xie put forward his views in a keynote address delivered at a
symposium on "hi-tech's influence on world strategy and national
security," attended by nearly 100 scientists, economists, military
generals, and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, some countries have been reforming their
military by focusing on information technology, and regional wars
in the 1990s have shown that the development of military equipment
will be part of the information era, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the weapons of war will undergo drastic changes, and
traditional military theory will be severely challenged, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Participants also pointed out that gaining a position in the
world's high-tech competition is vital to a country's state
sovereignty and economic security.
</P>
<P>
China, therefore, should employ the strategy of invigorating
the country through science and education, and continuously
increasing overall economic strength and military power, they
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Unbelievable Changes Have Taken Place in China: Former HK Legislator (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A former Hong Kong
legislator who stayed in the Chinese city of Nanchang during 1948-
1951 came back to the city 33 years later to find that nearly
nothing in her memory about the city still remained.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Tu, who was a member of the Legislative Council from 1988
to 1995 and a member of the Provisional Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region between 1997 and 1998,
came to Nanchang in 1948 from England as a missionary and she
revisited the city in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"The great changes that took place in Nanchang during the
previous decades left me nearly no traces of the old and poor city
where I had lived," Tu told Xinhua in an exclusive interview two
weeks prior to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People'
s Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
At her office at the Mu Kuang English School where Tu is the
supervisor, the white-haired former legislator said that
everything had changed in the city. There are all new buildings
and all new roads everywhere and everything's good, she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the old days roads in Nanchang were covered with mud but
when I re-visited the city 15 years ago I found the roads are
something like the Chang'an road in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
"When we were in Nanchang, we were the only ones to ride
bicycles, but this time everybody had a bicycle," she continued.
</P>
<P>
Tu was among the crowd to welcome the forces of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) when they moved into Nanchang in 1949. Like
the local residents, she cheered and waved to the PLA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"I hoped the revolution would succeed because the Kuomintang
government was very corrupt and the city was in a mess," Tu said.
"The economic situation was unbelievably bad. Every day the cost
of food would at least double," she added.
</P>
<P>
After the PLA moved into the town, they restored law and order
in the city, and stabilized the economy immediately.
</P>
<P>
During the trip to Nanchang in 1984 Tu found that people were
very proud of their lives at that time. Once, she asked a worker
who had lived in Nanchang when she was there to tell her the
difference between the old and the new China.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Improve Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
urged Tanzania to improve its road conditions as a major strategy
to boost economic development.
</P>
<P>
The bank, in its newly issued World Development Report, said
that about 88 percent of Tanzania's roads are in poor condition,
increasing vehicle operating costs to more than one third of
export earnings.
</P>
<P>
"Only 12 per cent of Tanzania's roads are in good condition,
with the rest imposing excess vehicle operating costs equivalent
to one third of export earnings in 1990," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's total export earnings in 1990 amounted to over 66.5
billion shillings, or more than 100 million U.S. dollars that
year, the statistics of the Tanzanian central bank showed.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the poor state of the roads have affected
production and marketing of agricultural crops in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The World Development Report 1999/2000 also noted that apart
from improving surface transportation, Tanzania needs to harmonize
its international telecommunication rates with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
"For Tanzanian exporters to compete effectively against
suppliers in South Africa and South Asia, the country's
infrastructure must deliver comparable services and charge similar
rates," recommended the World Bank report in its case study of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The bank urged the private sector to a play a larger role in
building and operating the transportation, communication and
electricity infrastructure in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Unbelievable Changes Have Taken Place in China: Former HK Legislator (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tu came to Hong Kong in 1951. She left the church because she
realized that it's wrong to put one's religion onto the others.
She worked as a teacher at a local college.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, she started a small school along with Tu Hueh Kwei,
who later became her husband, when they saw many children unable
to study because there were not enough schools, and the children
of poor workers could not afford the high fees of schools that
existed.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to help the poorest children from the squatter huts,"
she said. She spent most of her money earned from the college on
her own school.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the government which supplied a small piece
of land for a school in a tent, the school has developed to a
complex with more than 60 teachers and some 1,500 students. Her
good work in Hong Kong had won her awards from her mother
universities in Newcastle and Durham, England.
</P>
<P>
At her office Tu told Xinhua that great changes not only took
place in Nanchang but in other places. "The changes in Shanghai
also astonished me," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stopped over in Shanghai for a few days on the way from
England to Nanchang in January 1948.
</P>
<P>
"It was very very cold and people were dying on the streets,"
Tu recalled. "It was really terrible at that time." "I saw the
police beating people. They were very cruel to the ordinary
citizens."
</P>
<P>
"Going back to Shanghai about 5 years ago, I couldn't believe
what I saw there," Tu said.
</P>
<P>
In Pudong, there are unbelievable skyscrapers, new roads and
suspension bridges. "It's really exciting to see the new part of
Shanghai, very well organized and very well planned," she said.
</P>
<P>
She has been to some other places in China's mainland. She
found Suzhou is very charming with old and modern architecture
mixed together, Kunming is beautiful and Nanning is clean.
</P>
<P>
She visited the neighboring Guangdong province very often. "It
made so much progress that I could not find my way around. It had
changed every time I went there."
</P>
<P>
Tu became a member of Hong Kong's Urban Council in 1963 and in
1988 she was elected to the Legislative Council by the Urban
Councilors to represent them.
</P>
<P>
Her firm stance in favor of China annoyed the then Hong Kong
Governor Christopher Patten and some legislators who were always
against China. She was kicked out of the Urban Council by them in
1995 and then lost the right to stand for election to the LegCo as
a candidate of the functional constituency.
</P>
<P>
China decided to found a Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)
in 1997 as the legislators elected in 1995 could not transit
smoothly to the HKSAR by through train because Patten broke the
agreements between Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
Tu stood for election to the membership in the PLC. Asked for
the reason, she said that she wanted Hong Kong to be stable before
and after it returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"As an experienced legislative councilor, I would do the best I
could to keep the transition smooth," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I love living in Hong Kong because I have become accustomed to
the people here and feel at home with them. I have been part of
their life since coming in 1951," the lady said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy with China because the Beijing Government is
really keeping to the 'one country, two systems' concept, and is
faithfully carrying out the Basic Law," Tu said.
</P>
<P>
This should be a lesson to those who did not believe that China
would do so, Tu noted. Unfortunately, there are some who do not
want to believe and prefer to criticize.
</P>
<P>
"I think China has behaved very honorably towards Hong Kong,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's future, Tu said that when the former
Soviet Union collapsed she told Ji Pengfei, the then director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China, that it now all
depends on China to keep the world balanced.
</P>
<P>
China should become stronger and stronger to protect herself,
she said. China feeds such a big population and it has a long
history and the people are very clever, she added.
</P>
<P>
"I hope China will remain independent, strong and peaceful and
will lead the world economically in the new millennium," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A power integration
program enabling countries of Southeast Asia to sell their power
assets to their neighbors is undergoing a feasibility study,
according to a Malaysian official Friday.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study is under way under the auspices of the
Paris-based International Conference on Large High Voltage
Electric Systems (CIGRE) on power interconnection in the ASEAN
region, Fuad Jaafar, chairman of CIGRE Malaysian committee said.
</P>
<P>
A task force commissioned for Southeast Asia, Latin America,
Africa and South Asia regions is conducting the study which is
expected to be completed in two years, Jaafar told a press
conference at the end of the six-day CIGRE conference in Langkawi,
Malaysia's famous resort island in the north, Bernama news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The study would enable countries with excess electricity supply
to export their power resources to their neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
A policy is expected to be formulated based on the study, he

<HEADLINE> World Champion Liu Crashes Out at China Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World Champion and No.1
men's singles player Liu Guoliang was consigned to a third round
exit by his Chinese teammate Liu Guozheng at the '99 China Grand
Prix Table Tennis Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liu, only the second paddler in the world to complete a table
tennis "Grand Slam" of Olympic, world cup and world championships
titles, perished 21-11, 20-22, 10-21, 17-21.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel sorry," the 23-year-old said after the match. "
I had a mixed record against him (Liu Guozheng) in the training
camp, so the loss didn't surprise me this time. It's no big deal.
</P>
<P>
"And I had some problems with my neck and shoulders, which
affected me considerably in today's match."
</P>
<P>
Liu Guozheng, who is not related to his much famous teammate,
was obviously jubilant: " I feel superb today. Though I had an
edge over him in some training matches, it's the first time I
triumph over him in major tournaments."
</P>
<P>
World number two Ma Lin, beaten by Liu Guoliang in last month's
world championships men's singles final, also crashed out on
Friday, losing to German teenager Timo Boll 17-21, 21-17, 12-21,
23-21,18-21 in a trilling battle which deserved to be billed the
match of the day.
</P>
<P>
In an action of an upsets-filled day, Yan Sen of China, ranked
14th in the world, went down to veteran South Korean Yoo Nam Kyu
18-21, 13-21, 21-7, 17-21.
</P>
<P>
ITTF Pro-Tour champion Wang Liqin, who toughed out a 18-21, 21-
14, 21-18, 16-21, 21-15 win over his teammate Feng Zhe, emerged to
be favored to lift the men's singles title and the 12,500 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Parties Reject Army's Security Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tamil political parties in
the north of Sri Lanka have rejected an offer by the security
forces of the government to provide them with uniformed body
guards, the official evening newspaper The Observer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent assassinations of several Tamil
politicians and the continuing threats to their lives, northern
Jaffna military commander Major General Lohan Gunawardene Thursday
convened a special meeting of representatives of Tamil political
parties at Palaly in the Jaffna peninsula, The Observer said.
</P>
<P>
The commander suggested that the security forces could offer
Tamil politicians with arms and uniformed bodyguards for their
personal security.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that this arrangement would help prevent
culprits in civvies from creating problems and the rivalries from
emerging among the Tamil groups. However, the Tamil parties in the
north, including the Tamil United Liberation Front, have rejected
this offer by the commander.
</P>
<P>
They said they would be in danger while they go out with
uniformed bodyguards as they would become easy targets for the
Tamil rebels who are fighting a war for a separate state in the
north of the country.
</P>
<P>
These parties also insisted that their cadres in civvies should
be allowed to carry arms to provide security for their own leaders
and the members representing the local bodies in the north of Sri
Lanka, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Observer added that several members of the local
bodies and senior cadres of Tamil political parties opposing the
Tamil rebels had been killed in the north and east of the country
in the recent past.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ensures Safety of SLA After Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has pledged that Israel would ensure the well-being and safety of
its local militiamen in southern Lebanon in any peace settlement
with Lebanon and Syria, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Gen. Antoine Lahad, commander of the
pro-Israel South Lebanon Army, Barak reiterated that he is making
every effort to reach a peace agreement that would allow for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place Thursday in Tel Aviv, was Barak's
first meeting, as prime minister, with Lahad, the local daily
Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA is paid and armed by Israel to help its
1,500 troops patrol a border zone in southern Lebanon which Israel
carved out in 1985 with a proclaimed aim of protecting its
northern border areas from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
But morale of the SLA militia has been low since talks about an
Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon are becoming
louder.
</P>
<P>
Sworn in as prime minister in July, Barak has promised to pull
Israeli troops from southern Lebanon within one year of office
through negotiations with Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In what some people called a model for a possible withdrawal of
Israeli troops from the 15-kilometer-deep border zone, the SLA abandoned
an enclave just north of the zone in early June, after suffering
serious loss in battles with Hezbollah guerrillas, who are
fighting to end Israel's occupation.
</P>
<P>
About 150 among more than 200 former SLA militiamen who
voluntarily surrendered after the SLA withdrawal from Jezzine have
been sentenced in trials for pro-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
Collaborating with Israel is a serious charge under Lebanese
law, but most of the defendants received light sentences ranging
from one months to one or two years since Beirut has promised
leniency for those who surrendered.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an Israeli soldier and a civilian
army employee were lightly wounded by shrapnel Thursday when
Hezbollah fired mortars at an Israeli army position in the border
zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes later rocketed suspected guerrilla outposts
in retaliation, Israel Radio said.

<HEADLINE> Green-Faced Terra-cotta Warrior Found in Emperor's Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A terra-cotta warrior with a
green face has been found in the 2nd pit of the tomb of Emperor
Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of China in the Qin Dynasty (221-
206 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
This has aroused the interest of archeologists because all the
other warriors that have been unearthed have pink faces.
</P>
<P>
The warrior's face has verdigris hue, while its hair and
eyebrows and eyeballs are black.
</P>
<P>
Some have concluded that the green face is simply an artisan's
mistake, but others believe that the warrior depicts another race
of human being with a different color skin. No definitive
conclusions have yet been verified.
</P>
<P>
Qin Shihuang's tomb has been called "the eighth wonder of the
world"; experts maintain that the purpose of the warriors and
horses buried in his tomb was to maintain and protect the spirit
of their ruler throughout eternity.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform of State Firms Progressing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A year and a half before the
three-year deadline, China's reform of state-owned enterprises is
progressing.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics show
that China's state-owned enterprises had profits of 24.31 billion
yuan in the first half of this year, 3.8 times the figure for the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 provinces and regions witnessed better economic
returns than last year, and major industrial sectors such as
petroleum, chemicals, and textiles also showed more profits and
fewer losses.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government pledged last year to turn most of the
losing state firms into profitable ones in three years.
</P>
<P>
China is still looking for new measures. At the beginning of
this month, the first debt-to-equity trial was unveiled in Beijing.
Shanghai, the country's largest industrial base, also brought the
trial into operation later.
</P>
<P>
The "debt-to-equity" trial allows financial-assets management
companies to manage bad loans of commercial banks and change part
of them for the equity of certain firms. In this way, those firms
losing money because of a high debt ratio will be eased of their
debt burden.
</P>
<P>
Economic insiders have expressed confidence in this trial
method. In Liaoning Province, which is dense with state firms, 27
state firms have applied for the trial. If this trial is carried
out successfully, these firms may earn as much as 3.75 billion
yuan in profit this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform of State Firms Progressing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pro-active fiscal policy adopted by the government will
also benefit the reform. China issued an additional 60 billion
yuan of treasury bonds this year, which is expected to trigger 66.
5 billion yuan of additional investment for technological
upgrading in state firms.
</P>
<P>
The reserves for writing-off the bad loans of state firms
during bankruptcy and merger is also likely to increase this year,
said an official from the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Measures to expand domestic demand along with the pro-active
fiscal policy adopted during the past two years will continue next
year, providing firms with greater funds and larger markets.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the state-owned economy in the national
economy determines the significance of SOE reform. Among the urban
employed population, 60 percent are in the state-owned sector, and
55 percent of state financial revenues comes from SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Silin, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, expressed confidence in the success of reforming state-
owned enterprises. He said that reaching the present target is
just a start, and the country must continue its efforts in order
to see these companies grow in a healthy way.

<HEADLINE> Wang Nan Advances at China Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World Champion Wang Nan
of China had to concede one set before prevailing 21-16, 22-20, 16-
21, 21-11 over Croatian Tamara Boros in the women's singles
category of the '99 China Grand Prix Table Tennis Championships
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, crowned as the new queen of the game by winning the 45th
World Championships in Eindhoven, the Netherlands last month,
looked set to make another routine straight-set win before
apparently losing her concentration in the third rubber.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's Boros, ranked 14th as the lone non-Chinese player in
the world women's singles top 20, capitalized on the defending
champion's aberration to close out the set 21-16.
</P>
<P>
But the 20-year-old top seed recollected herself quickly and
was the relatively steadier player in the fourth set which was a
poor showing for the either side of the table as both of them made
a string of unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling weary in the third set and made some mistakes,
but fortunately they were not big enough to cost me, " Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang faces her teammate Yang Ying, a 17-21, 21-9, 21-13, 21-12
conqueror over another Chinese paddler Cheng Hongxia, in the
quarter-finals later on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang's doubles partner and world number three Li Ju also
reached the last eight, dismissing doubles specialist Zhang
Yingying 21-11, 21-11, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
World championships revelation Li Nan and qualifier Niu
Jianfeng made sure the women's quarter-finals were an all-Chinese
affair with their triumphs over South Korean duo Ryu Ji Hae and
Kim Moo Kyo respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China. China's economic
successes over the past five decades has attracted the attention
of the world. Xinhua began issuing a series of stories about the
country's economy on August 17. This is the 25th and the last in
the series.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Dan Gottlieb and Barrack
Freedman, two young tourists from Israel, ran back and forth along
the newly renovated Tian'anmen Square in the heart of Beijing,
trying to fly a kite. Although they failed in every attempt, they
were still in high spirits.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen some beautiful scenery in China, but I found it
more interesting to watch and participate in the daily life of the
Chinese people," said Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
The young man, who toured scenic spots and historic sites in
China's Yunnan, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces before coming to
Beijing, is one of the millions of overseas tourists who visit
China every year.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 years ago, tourism in China was just at the beginning
and travel in the country was often an experience full of
hardships and hassles for those who were smart enough to be among
the first visitors from overseas.
</P>
<P>
At that time, there were great restrictions on overseas
travelers in China "for security reasons", and even in Beijing's
suburbs they could see many signs warning against trespassing by
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Now overseas visitors with tourist visas are free to travel in
most of the cities and counties across the country and enjoy their
holidays with the support of a complete tourist service network,
including hotels, food, communications and recreation. The old
warning signs are few and rare indeed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA)
indicate that by the end of last year, the number of China's
travel agencies had jumped to more than 6,200, from only two in
the mid-1950s, and that of tourist hotels surged from almost none
to 5,782, including 64 at the five-star level.

Travel around China was hardly a pleasure in the old days, as
the itineraries were often dull and tightly controlled. "Visit
temples during the day and sleep at night," was a popular saying
among these early visitors.
</P>
<P>
Today tourist schedules are greatly diversified, and CNTA
assigns a theme to each year, and 1999 is the Year of Ecotourism,
during which the country's natural and cultural heritage is being
highlighted.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province and Jiuzhaigou in Sichuan
Province are two of the country's wildest and most appealing
ecotour destinations recommended by CNTA.
</P>
<P>
To welcome the new millennium, CNTA has set "New Millennium --
China 2000" as the theme for next year, when a series of
celebrations and gala events will be arranged.
</P>
<P>
Among the various tourist arrangements, the technology tour is
perhaps the most unusual, taking travelers to places where earlier
foreign visitors would have been most unwelcome and certainly
branded as "spies."
</P>
<P>
On the itinerary of a Sichuan techno-tour is the home of China'
s first atom bomb -- the Chinese Physical Engineering Institute at
Mianyang City, and the satellite launching facility at Xichang
City.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, many of the world's keenest travelers regard China as
a realistic dream destination for its wonders such as the Great
Wall, Forbidden City and Terra-cotta Warriors, among others, and
low international air fares.

CNTA says that China received 63.47 million overseas tourists
and earned 12.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, up 35 times and 48
times over 1978, respectively, and ranking sixth and seventh in
the world in terms of overseas tourists received and revenues
earned.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, more than 40 million
overseas tourists visited the country, a 15-percent increase from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign tourism experts predict that by the year 2020,
China will rank first in the world by welcoming some 130 million
overseas tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
And booming international tourism also has promoted the rapid
development of domestic tourism.
</P>
<P>
A total of 690 million Chinese -- more than half the nation's 1.
2 billion people, traveled in 1998 and spent over 239 billion yuan
while doing so, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country
's total tourism revenue.
</P>
<P>
A survey report says that 80 percent of China's urban residents
travel at least once or twice in a year, and the number of farmers
who travel is also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that tourism has become a new growth point in the
country's economy and project that tourism revenue will contribute
more than eight percent to the nation's gross domestic product by
2010, compared with the current 4.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Closes Border to Stop Fuel Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Ministry of
Finance has ordered closing the border with Thailand to crack down
on rampage fuel smuggling that is costing the government some
800,000 U.S. dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Council of Ministers, the
decision to close the border to overland fuel transports would
both curb smuggling and create a fairer market for legitimate
petroleum companies.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products will come into Cambodia only through water
ports in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of fuel through the Thai-Cambodia border has
become a serious problem. Minister of Finance Keat Chhon said
recently that about 2 million U.S. dollars in tax revenue were
lost each month to smugglers, while the fuel smuggling accounted
for 800,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 percent of the fuel consumption depends on
smuggling due to cheaper prices of the smuggled products. The
retail petrol in Cambodia is more expensive than in Thailand and
Vietnam. In Thailand, one dollar can buy three litters of gas, but
in Cambodia only two litters. And one ton gas in Cambodia is 100
dollars more than in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 200 gas stations in
Cambodia, with 100 in Phnom Penh. The gas companies like Sokimex,
Caltax, Total, Petronas, PTT, Mitapeap, Shell and Tela all have
licenses to operate.
</P>
<P>
Last week, seven oil trucks traveling into the Pailin town from
Thailand were seized by Battambang provincial authorities and
later were sent back to Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
The world's top combination were forced to bring out their best
to fend off a gallant challenge from South Koreans Park Hae Jung
and Kim Moo Kyo 21-19, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
But the close score still belied the truth of the story where
the upset-minded South Koreans possessed several realistic chances
to turn the match around.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Li were held to a 19-19 tricky situation in both sets,
and the steel nerves and experience saved the day for them finally.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans might have left the match determined to work
out their incapability to win the big points as they gave
themselves away with unforced errors at the break-even point.
</P>
<P>
Wang/Li next square up to their teammates Zhang Yining and
Zhang Yingying, who won an all-Chinese affair 21-18, 20-22, 21-11
against Wang Tingting and Cheng Hongxia.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian pair Csilla Bartrofi and Krisztina Toth prevented the
women's doubles competitions from becoming a domestic event for
the Chinese by eking out a 21-19, 21-23, 23-21 victory over
Chinese qualifiers Niu Jianfeng and Xu Jie.
</P>
<P>
Waiting for them in the later semi-finals are another Chinese
connection Li Nan and Lin Ling, who thrashed teammates Yang Ying
and Sun Jin 21-15, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
There will be 4,000 U.S. dollars in prize money in store for
the doubles champions.

<HEADLINE> Sewing Machines Losing Popularity in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- On October 1, 1978, Xiang
Youhua, a resident in the southwest China city of Chongqing,
bought a sewing machine and became a rich guy in the eyes of his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Before the reforms of the late 1970s, any Chinese wanting to
purchase one of the coveted machines had to stand in line outside
a department store, sometimes from dusk to dawn, with hard-won
coupons.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, we had to call police to maintain order," said
Zhuang Zhenliang, a worker at Chongqing Department Store.
</P>
<P>
By the mid-80s, however, the government stopped the practice of
issuing coupons for the "Big Three" items most desired by Chinese -
- a bicycle, a watch, and a sewing machine. This was made possible
by China's economic boom resulting from the reform and opening up
policy, which has greatly boosted people's living standards and
ensured an adequate supply of these items.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1990s, sales of sewing machines became
so sluggish that in 1991, the Chongqing Department Store stopped
buying new machines, and it took another two years to sell those
already on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang attributes the public's fading enthusiasm for sewing
machines in part to the appearance of ready-made garments that
hold huge appeal and are affordable for the majority of Chinese
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of clothing are available in shops and the ready-
made ones are better and cheaper than the homemade," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Instruments of Torture on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of instruments
of torture used in ancient China recently opened in Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The show is sponsored by Yang Yukui, a local collector and
reproducer of old torture devices, whose goal is to inform people
about the old society and have them appreciate the democracy they
enjoy in today's more civilized world.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 of these items along with many books of law are
on display and have attracted many visitors, including foreigners,
many of whom were shocked at what they saw.
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky I live in a civilized society governed by law," said
a Japanese student.
</P>
<P>
Throughout history, the methods of punishing criminals have
evolved and progressed from barbarism to civilization, Yang said,
urging that people understand the superiority of modern democracy
and law.
</P>
<P>
A local observer pointed out that these barbaric instruments
represent the past. Since the founding of the People's Republic of
China, the government abandoned the old laws, and instruments of
torture have faded into history.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province Making Islands More Habitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province, a coastal
province in east China, plans to make its habitable islands more
comfortable places to live by improving their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang boasts 3,061 islands -- more than 40 percent of the
country's total. In recent years, the province has made it a
practice to build up the bigger ones and relocate residents from
the smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, the Provincial government believes it can
resolve problems related to water and electricity supply, ports,
and telecommunications for all the habitable islands by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government is also considering a 10-year
program to completely upgrade the investment and living
environment in the islands.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, Zhejiang has made remarkable achievements
in this concern. Currently, all islands, each with a population of
5,000 and above, have set up ports for shipping passengers and
goods, while ferries are used for those with a population of 10,
000 and above.
</P>
<P>
All island cities and counties in the province have been
connected to national telecommunications webs and regional power-
supply networks.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force Commander to Visit E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian commander of
the multinational force for East Timor will travel to the
territory this weekend to clear the way for the arrival of armed
peacekeepers, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major General Peter Cosgrove, commander of force authorized by
the U.N. Security Council to move into East Timor, would hold
talks with commanders of the Indonesian armed forces (TNI)
remaining in the territory, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to comment on reports that TNI units
were now withdrawing to West Timor ahead of the arrival of the
Australian-led U.N. International Force for East Timor (INTERFET).
</P>
<P>
"There will be high-level consultations with various Indonesian
commanders on the ground in East Timor to state the United
Nations' position," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said details of the timing of the visit and who
else would go could not be revealed for security reasons. Neither
would he say when the troops were set to go in.
</P>
<P>
Another defense source said a key aim of the visit would be to
arrange for the cooperation of the TNI in the safe arrival of the
U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Defense Force has persistently refused to reveal
which Australian military units will contribute the promised 4,500
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, various Royal Australian Navy ships are visible in the
harbor of Darwin in northern Australia and the deployable joint
force headquarters in the eastern Australian city of Brisbane will
form the basis of the INTERFET command structure.
</P>
<P>
The international contribution to the force continues to grow
with a Portuguese armed forces field hospital unit, comprising
some 80 personnel and equipment, expected into Darwin Friday
afternoon.

</P>
<P>
So far, more than 20,000 wild animals, in over 80 species, are
living in the area. Boars, bears and golden-leopards have been
spotted by local people.
</P>
<P>
Many local hunters have given up hunting and joined the ranks
of protecting wild animals.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Becomes India's Major Trading Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An Indian official has
described Zambia as one of his country's major trading partners
despite the information gap that has hampered a much faster growth
rate in their economic ties.
</P>
<P>
India High Commissioner to Zambia Ashok Attri was quoted by
Times of Zambia newspaper as saying on Friday that trade turnover
between the two countries reached 120 million U.S. dollars between
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Because of good investment opportunities in Zambia, Attri said
a number of Indian companies have shown interest in investing in
Zambia in various fields.
</P>
<P>
During the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation day
celebrations in Lusaka Thursday, he said that the investment from
Indian companies in Zambia from 1994 to1998 amounted to 307
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"India-Zambia economic and trade ties have been growing
steadily over the years. Growth could have been much faster given
the opportunities that have opened up in the wake of the economic
reform programs in both countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said India's indigenous technologies particularly
for small scale industries and information sector were suitable
for the Zambian needs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Zambian government was encouraging the
development of small scale industries which would provide greater
economic exchanges with the Indian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture sector, particularly commercial farming and agro
industries sector, also provide increased opportunities of
cooperation between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Zambian Education Deputy
Minister Betram Mmembe commended the Indian government for
economically rendering a support for Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Mmembe said the South-South cooperation was encouraging as
Zambia would not be disadvantaged in the globalization of the
world's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said human resources development and capacity building was
important for Zambia to compete favorably in open markets.

<HEADLINE> "European Castle" Built in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Villas with white walls and a
red cone-shaped roof are surrounded by a green lawn and trees. In
the distance, a large windmill creaks gently.
</P>
<P>
A lakeside in Geneva? Try the suburbs of Lhasa, the capital of
the Tibet Autonomous Region, in southwest China, where Tibetan
architect Danzen has created the European "castle" for local
tourists.
</P>
<P>
"Since many foreigners have been attracted to Tibetan
architecture, the Tibetan people should also learn something about
foreign buildings," Danzen says.
</P>
<P>
Danzen, who has traveled overseas, was inspired to build the
villas after he saw various architectural styles from different
countries at the ongoing World Horticultural Exposition in Kunming,
the provincial capital of Yunnan, a neighboring province of Tibet
in the east.
</P>
<P>
It took Danzen and his buddies one and a half months to
complete the "Linqionka Fishing Castle," which droves of local
holiday-goers have taken a shine to.
</P>
<P>
"Some people say I'm acting senselessly and against the Tibetan
tradition, but I never see creation as a wrongdoing," he says.
</P>
<P>
In the "castle" garden, guests can fish, dine, talk to parrots,
enjoy the view of mountains, rivers, trees and farmland, or just
leisurely while away the hours on yak-fur-covered chairs.
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen such strange buildings. In Tibet, all houses
were flat-roofed except lamaseries," says Mamala, head of a nearby
village.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Prepares Boxers for Olympic Qualification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Amateur Boxing
Association (Pertina) is preparing four boxers to compete in the
Asian Championships, which will also serve as the first Olympic
qualifying round, set for October 23-31 in Tashkent, Uzbekstan.
</P>
<P>
Pertina secretary-general Didiet Soedijoto said that the four
boxers still needed to undergo a physical test at the National
Sports Council (KONI) Sports Science Commission.
</P>
<P>
The boxers are light flyweight La Paene Masara, flyweight
Hermansen Ballo, light welterweight Willem Papilaya and
welterweight Bara Gomies.
</P>
<P>
"We will decide if they are really ready to compete in the
Olympic qualification by staging physical tests and judging their
performance based on their coach's evaluation," he was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Didiet said Pertina was also preparing more boxers to compete
in the second qualification in Seoul January 25-February 1 and the
third in Bangkok June 1-7.
</P>
<P>
Pertina is aiming to grab more Olympic berths. In the 1996
Olympics, Indonesia earned five tickets, through Nemo Bahari, La
Paene,Ballo, Hendrik Simangunsong and Pino Bahari. Pino failed to
compete.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope to win a medal in the Olympics," Didiet said.
</P>
<P>
Pertina is still searching for a Cuban coach to groom boxers,
and will hopefully start training in November. In 1996, its
boxers were trained by Cuban coach Isidiro Trotman.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba is known as a boxing country. In 1996, 17 countries
groomed their boxers in Cuba prior to the Olympics. We can only
provide a 1,500 U.S. dollars monthly salary for the coach," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Didiet said Pertina must send all boxers qualified for the
Olympics for an overseas stint, either in Cuba or Uzbekstan.
</P>
<P>
"They need regular competition and good sparring partners,
which can only be found in those two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pertina has budgeted more than one billion rupiah (125,000 U.S.
dollars) to get its boxers ready for the Sydney Olympics.

government will take a ticket selling and distribution method to
ensure the safety and convenience of visitors joining the mass
park tours it is preparing for celebrating the 50th anniversary of
New China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Mass park tours are part of activities organized on important

organizers used to distribute all tickets to organizations for
planned re-distribution. This year, celebration activities will be
available in ten major parks in the city.
</P>
<P>
"In order to enable more people to join the tour this time,
while at the same time preventing possible hazards from
overcrowding, we've decided to sell a limited number of tickets
and distribute special tickets to certain groups," said Feng
Shouren, executive deputy chief director of the National Day park
tour.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference organized by All-China Journalists
Association here today, he said that on October 1, a certain
number of tickets will be sold, while the rest will be reserved
for special guests who are unable to take part in the mass parade
and the gala night.
</P>
<P>
The tour on October 2 is part of the National Day Celebration
and no tickets will be sold, and from October 3 to 5, part of the
tickets will be open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
Feng added that the price of the tickets will remain the same
as usual.
</P>
<P>
The ten leading parks have been busy these days preparing to
host visitors during the National Day holiday. Besides, the

<HEADLINE> Yuan Dynasty Shipwreck Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The remains of a ship made
during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) was discovered recently in
Liaocheng City of east China's Shandong Province by workers
dredging the course of the Grand Beijing-Hangzhou Canal.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the sunken ship is made of planks,
has a flat bottom, and is 10.8 meters long with a maximum width of
2.3 meters.
</P>
<P>
The ship is well preserved and has obvious traces of the cabin
outlined by the orderly distribution of nails. Workers also found
utensils including lamps and bowls as well as rotted rice on the
boat.
</P>

Experts believe that the ship was a grain carrier. The Grand
Canal was in disuse for some time during the late period of the
Yuan Dynasty.

The Grand Beijing-Hangzhou Canal, built in the Sui Dynasty (581-
618), is 1,800 kilometers long and is considered the world's
longest man-made canal. It served as the major north-south means
of transportation in ancient China.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is scheduled to hold talks here on Friday with members of
the Parliamentary Committee on defense over the issue of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
There has been concern from the general public and the
legislature over Uganda's continued military presence in the DRC,
according to a New Vision daily report Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday, President Museveni said that
his government would abide by the Lusaka agreement which provides
for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the DRC within 180 days
of its signature on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Monitor newspaper reported Friday that Rwandan Vice President
Paul Kagame told the Parliament in Kigali Thursday that Uganda's
army should be totally responsible for the fighting between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, DRC, in mid-August in
which both sides sustained heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Kagame, who is also minister of Defense, said that Rwanda held
120 Ugandan soldiers as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, however, rejected the joint inquiry report which
accused Ugandan troops of provoking the clashes, and formed a new
investigation team to come up with a more balanced and
comprehensive report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Army High Command has been meeting for four days
running in State House over this issue, and the new inquiry team
headed by State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma was authorized

<HEADLINE> Gulf Glass Producers Urged to Merge Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Gulf producers of glass
and glass products should merge operations to make their products
more competitive, a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) industrial
thinktank has suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Mergers have become an important means for sectoral
restructuring in all regions of the world. Glass manufactures,
particularly glass bottle producers, in the GCC should consider
this option seriously for better competitiveness of their products
and establishments," said the latest monthly bulletin of the
Doha-based Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC),
which was published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Glass production in the GCC started in 1964 in Kuwait, where
the first plant was established by the Kuwaiti Glass
Manufacturing and Trading Co.
</P>
<P>
Glass plants in the six GCC countries has increased to 52 so
far, entailing a total investment of 822 million U.S. dollars and
providing jobs to 5,661 persons.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar Sharafi, the head of the industrial
coordination unit of GOIC, Saudi Arabia has 30 glass plants, UAE
has 10, Kuwait five, Bahrain four, Oman two and Qatar one.
</P>
<P>
Listing out the hurdles currently faced by Gulf glass
industries, the GOIC report pointed at excess capacities, strong
competition, lack of environment protection measures and absence of
strict standards and specifications.
</P>
<P>
Sharafi added that there is a lack of coordination or
cooperation among GCC producers and no control over production or
any limits to illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
Although some GCC establishments are exporting to international
markets, they are still experiencing marketing difficulties due to
their low competitiveness, lack of efficient marketing policies
and the protective measures adopted by foreign governments, the
head said.
</P>
<P>
While mergers have been suggested as a remedial measure that
Gulf glass producers can adopt, the others include issuing of
relevant specifications for the concerned glass varieties and
products, as well as launching of an awareness campaign to
emphasize the importance of glass collection, sorting and
recycling for environment protection.

CHENGDU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Changhong Electronics Group,
an electronics giant in China, has scored remarkable achievements
in its three-year technological cooperation with well-known
transnationals.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua)-- Lu Fengcai's face was glowing
with pride when she told the story of how she developed a high-
temperature material for China's first rocket launch 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I slept alone in a small laboratory in a large research
building in suburban Beijing to monitor a test explosion round-the-
clock on the material I had developed for the rocket," said the 70-
year-old scientist, who was then working at the Institute of
Chemistry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"All the research staff would clear out in the evening except
me and two armed guards," recalled the small and thin woman. "One
night, a loud rumbling sound woke me up, I jumped off the bed
thinking that the explosion had begun."
</P>
<P>
"But as I heard the footsteps of one of the young soldiers
walking out of the washroom next to my lab, I knew it was just the
sound of a toilet flushing," Lu smiled, as she recalled one
incident of her hard and sometimes tedious work at a secret
experimental site near Beijing.
</P>
<P>
From early 1956 to 1970, the Chinese Academy of Sciences chose
the best of its young scientists to work for the development of an
atomic bomb, guided missiles, and man-made satellites. Lu and her
husband were among the thousands of young researchers chosen for
this "special task."
</P>
<P>
"I always tried hard to finish my work early, and wanted to
start on new projects as soon as possible," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
During the vital period of developing key techniques for the
creation of an atomic bomb, the "Three Hard Years" (1960-1962)
struck China.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the poor living conditions, we were still
enthusiastic about our research work," recalled Zheng Zhemin, Lu's
75-year-old husband, a physicist and an academician with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"I would work late into the night on an empty stomach, and when
I left at midnight I often saw that the lights of many offices
were still on," he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a Palestinian cabinet minister known for
his harsh criticism of Israeli policy, was appointed Thursday to
lead the Palestinian delegation in talks with Israel on a final
peace agreement. He was among the first in the Palestine
Liberation Organization to push for reconciliation with Israel,
but he often adopted tougher positions than his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The lawyer for Jerusalem contractor Avner Amedi threatened
Thursday to sue former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the
440,000 shekels (about 110,000 U.S. dollars) Amedi feels he is
owed for work done for the Netanyahu family. Amedi has been under
investigation over suspicions that he bribed Netanyahu during his
three years of office by providing various services without charge.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef will remove Ya'acov
Hemed, the director-general of the Shas's school system, from his
post immediately after the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
Hemed's dismissal followed the demand by Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein that Hemed be replaced or resign before the
government could transfer any more funds to the Shas's debt-ridden
school system.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Sara Netanyahu, wife of former prime minister Netanyahu,
will possibly be summoned again by the police who are
investigating the Netanyahu family over suspicion that they have
taken bribes and misused public funds.

"I don't know what encouraged us to carry on, but I am sure it
was not money or rewards. I received nothing special for my '
special task' but only a few packages of cigarettes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng graduated from the Department of Mechanics of Qinghua
University in 1947 and obtained his postgraduate and doctoral
degrees at the University of California in the United States,
where he worked as an assistant professor until 1954.
</P>
<P>
He then returned to the motherland and played an important role
in solving some theoretical problems related to underground tests
for China's atomic bomb, which was successfully developed in 1964.
</P>
<P>
He was also involved in creating the monitoring and testing
instruments for the first guided missile in China, launched in
1960, and the satellite launched in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Today, Zheng and his wife are living in an ordinary three-room
apartment in Zhongguancun in northwest Beijing. They still spend
most of their time working and tutoring their postgraduate and
doctorate students.
</P>
<P>
"Doing the research work for the missile launch is what I am
most proud of in my life, " said Lu. "I know there are tens of
thousands of scientists who worked for the same purpose. We cannot
all be remembered by the people, but our work as a whole will not
be forgotten."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Measures to Meet IMF Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
take further fiscal and monetary measures to meet targets set by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the release of its
outstanding balance of payments support aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Harare on Thursday, Minister of
Finance Herbert Murerwa said the new steps will ensure the program
that the government and the IMF agreed to last month is kept on
track.
</P>
<P>
Bringing inflation down to 30 percent by the year end, removal
of foreign exchange controls, speeding up privatization and
cutting the number of civil servants to 152,000 by December are
among the targets set by the IMF before the release of 193 million
U.S. dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
An inter-ministerial committee of key economic ministries will
be established to monitor the program and report regularly to the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was obvious that due to expenditure
overruns, the target budget deficit of 5.3 percent of gross
domestic product was unlikely to be achieved unless remedial steps
were taken.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the performance of the budget in the first half of
1999, budgetary expenditures in each ministry for the second half
of 1999 will be contained in order to try and meet the fiscal
deficit target," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
is also expected to bring down defence expenditure, while the
reduction of the civil service will continue to be undertaken in
the remaining seven ministries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had not been able to contain runaway
inflation, now standing at 68.5 percent because the monetary
policy had been compromised by excessive money supply growth.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to emphasize once more the critical importance for our
country to continue receiving financial support from the Bretton
Woods Institutions and other donors in order to achieve
macro-economic stability and forge ahead with economic reforms,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Turkey Naval Maneuvers Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's joint naval
maneuvers with Turkey have been postponed until late December,
local daily "The Jerusalem Post" reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The daily also said that there were reports that Jordan, which
attended the previous joint sea exercise in January 1988 as
observer, had decided to shun this year's exercises.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense officials could not confirm this, but noted
that Jordan had recently held joint search and rescue maneuvers
with the Israeli Navy in the Gulf of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The naval maneuvers, dubbed Reliant Merimaid II, are to
include vessels from the American, Israeli and Turkish fleets. The
search and rescue exercises was originally set for late summer off
the coast of Turkey, but they were delayed until October.
</P>
<P>
Now it has been postponed again until the end of the year and
no reason was given for the postponement.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Turkish diplomatic sources as saying that
even the new date may also be premature, since Turkey does not
want to annoy the Arab League nations which could to help its
reconstruction following last month's earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has criticized the maneuvers and the growing
military alliance between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli officials were confident the new naval
exercises would take place on the new date, Israeli defense
officials added.

<HEADLINE> Howard Defends Australian Trade Surplus with S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Friday defended Australia's large trade surplus with
South Korea after it was raised during talks with South Korean
President Kim Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Kim, who is on his first visit
to Australia, Howard said the trade issue had been discussed.
</P>
<P>
"It is never possible to have a perfect trade balance with
every country with which you trade," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I observed to the president and his colleagues that Australia
has a trade surplus with (South) Korea, but in turn (South) Korea
has a trade surplus with many of the countries with which
Australia has a trade deficit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we work towards reducing the barriers, but we must be
careful not to have as a specific goal a perfect balance in every
case," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted South Korea held a substantial share of the domestic
small car market in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard also described relations between Australia and South
Korea as being in a very healthy condition.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was Australia's third largest export market in
1997/98, with exports valued at 6.4 billion Australian dollars
(4.2 billion U.S. dollars) compared with imports of 3.8 billion
Australian dollars - a merchandise trade surplus for Australia of
2.6 billion Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the two leaders cited concerns about
growing protectionist sentiment and said a new round of World
Trade Organization negotiations was essential.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the two countries had signed agreements on energy and
resources, science and technology, communications and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries agreed to expand bilateral trade and
investment in a balanced manner," he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> UAE Considers Building of Underground Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) is considering building a metro to ease traffic jams on the
highway linking its two important northern emirates - Dubai and
Sharjah.
</P>
<P>
The subway study is the first to be carried out by the UAE,
despite the fact that metro has become one of the most important
means of transportation in many cities around the world, the
Khaleej Times daily said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestions between Dubai and Sharjah have adverse
impacts on the economy, productivity, health and security, and
the establishment of a subway would serve the interests of the
two neighboring emirates, according to Lieutenant Colonel Omar
Mohammed Al Owais of Sharjah Traffic Department.
</P>
<P>
"Commuters between the two emirates find it hard at rush hours
to reach their destinations in time. The 10 kilometers stretch
takes at least 45 minutes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there had been a big increase in registered
vehicles in both emirates, let alone the huge traffic transiting
through both cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, he has met other officials from
both emirates and studied with them the feasibility of such a
project that involves an investment of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE, with its growing economy, requires fast and
efficient means of transport, and a subway can help confront the
challenges of the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A subway, that can be expanded to cover all the emirates, is a
good asset," he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are no railways at all in the oil-rich Gulf
country. All the seven emirates - Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras
Al-Khaimah, Fujairah, Umm Al-Qaiwain and Ajman are linked by
modern highways.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Teachers Threaten to Strike Over Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Secondary School
Teachers Association of Israel has threatened to launch national
strikes if teachers salaries in the Arab and Druse sectors are not
paid, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The association Chairman Ran Erez was quoted as saying that in
many Arab sectors, the teachers have not received their salaries
even for several months, because the local councils have run into
huge debts or misused the funds for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
"We can not accept this serious situation, so we have decided
to step up the fight and make it a national campaign, if teachers'
salaries are not paid immediately," Erez said.
</P>
<P>
Erez criticized the government for paying too much attention in
solving the teacher's salary issue of Shas, the coalition partner
of the current government, while neglecting the problems of Arab
teachers.
</P>
<P>
"While the prime minister and education ministry are spending
day and night solving the problems of the Shas education system
teachers, there are hundreds of teachers in the Arab sector who
are on the verge of starvation, and the association must fight on
their behalf," Erez stressed.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid said Thursday night he would
ask officials to look into ways of getting the Arab and Druse
teachers paid directly, instead of via the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1 million Israeli Arabs in Israel and most of
them are living in northern part of the country.

WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The hosts America came
closer to the title of the United States International Women's
Basketball Invitational as they powered past Poland 86-67 to reach
the final on Thursday.
</P>

The Americans dominated the game with suffocating press as
Poland struggled to get the ball upcourt and committed turn-overs
over 16 times.
</P>
<P>
Natalie Williams and Lisa Leslie led the American team with 18
points apiece. Margo Dydek had 24 points and nine rebounds to

<P>
GUILIN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The men's doubles
competitions at the ongoing China Table Tennis Grand Prix here
took on a rare face as, unexpectedly, only one Chinese pair made
the last four on Friday.
</P>
<P>
World championships silver medalists Wang Liqin and Yan Sen, 21-
16, 21-15 winners over their teammates Feng Zhe and Liu Heng, were
the lone Chinese presence in an event where the host nation has
been in the habit of expecting an all-Chinese affair.
</P>
<P>
Last month China left the 45th Table Tennis World Championships
full-handed with all the five gold and silver medals on offer.
</P>
<P>
Veteran South Korean partnership Kim Taek Soo/Oh Sang Eun led a
foreign counter offensive against the Chinese contingent which was
short of their best line-up and world champions Kong Linghui/Liu
Guoliang for Kong was absent through injury.
</P>
<P>
Kim and Oh foiled the Chinese opposition in the shape of Ma Lin/
Qin Zhijian, the defending champions of the tournament, in a 21-18,
16-21, 21-11 hard-fought win.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't work out my best form today," said Ma, also world
championships runner-up as a singles player. "And I don't know
what's going wrong in the third rubber."
</P>
<P>
But to the South Koreans' disappointment, they emerged from the
gruelling three-set match only to find themselves in a domestic
semi-final fray against teammates Lee Chul Seung/Park Sang Joon.
</P>
<P>
Lee/Park came from one set down to see off German pair Timo
Boll/Lars Hielscher 16-21, 21-16, 21-15.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Discuss Fight Against Crimes, Refugee Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TORKU, September 16, (Xinhua) -- Justice and interior ministers
of 15 European Union (EU) countries started a two-day informal
meeting on Thursday in Torku, the ancient capital of Finland.
</P>
<P>
In the first day of the meeting, the ministers mainly exchanged
ideas on fighting against crimes, establishing the European Area
of Justice and shaping common refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a preparation for decisions to be taken in the
mid-October Special Session of EU leaders -- a milestone in EU
international construction.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants also focused on the prevention of
economic and criminal offense, cooperation in criminal
investigation and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Organized crimes are quickly spreading among EU countries. The
meeting appealed for strengthened function of EU police, and hoped
that an EU joint investigation group against crimes be set up in
order to cooperate in public prosecution.
</P>
<P>
As many criminals are increasingly utilizing new technology,
the ministers held that it is important to put the latest
technology into the fight against crimes.
</P>
<P>
In dealings with economic offense, especially against the
rampant money laundry, they stressed that EU should formulate
common policy towards countries and regions outside EU.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, Britain and Denmark proposed prevention of crimes to be
a new domain of EU cooperation, and supported the establishment of
a network of criminologists and a strategy against organized multi-
national crimes. They also asked EU to pay special attention to
the prevention of juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
To establish the European Area of Justice, the ministers
suggested providing consulting services and assistance to help
civilians gain deeper understanding of the judicial systems, and
simplifying extradition procedures, mutual recognition of the
judicial procedures of each other and closer connections of
relevant legislation.
</P>
<P>
New EU Commissioner for Justice and Interior, Antonio Vitorino,
said in a press conference that the European Area of Justice will
be a new challenge to EU in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will continue on Friday to talk about a common
refugee policy.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Hits St. Petersburg Building, Two Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded late Thursday
on the staircase of a nine-story apartment building in St.
Petersburg, killing two people, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The explosive device, equivalent to 4-5 kilograms of TNT,
exploded on the staircase of the seventh floor at 23:45 Moscow
time (19:45 GMT) and caused fire damage on three upper floors.
Several canisters containing gasoline were reportedly stored in
one of the apartments.
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth apartment building in Russia to be struck by
fire in about two weeks. The previous four -- one in the
Daghestani town of Buinaksk, two in Moscow, and another one in the
southern city of Volgodonsk -- have killed nearly 300 people.
</P>
<P>
The explosions are believed to have been set off by Islamic
terrorists in revenge for the defeat of their armed intrusion into
Daghestan, a southern republic bordering the break-away province
of Chechnya.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The first flight carrying
vital supplies of food to be airdropped to East Timorese refugees
took off from Darwin, northern Australia, Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian coordinator Ross Mountain said the Royal
Australian Air Force C130 Hercules would drop 20 pallets of rice
and possibly blankets to the town of Ermera, south of Dili, where
20,000 displaced people are believed to be staying.
</P>
<P>
Mountain told reporters in Darwin that the town was chosen
because people there had not had food for one week and were
believed to be some of the most needy in the province.
</P>
<P>
Flights were being arranged on a case-by-case basis and the
United Nations did not have carte blanche from the Indonesian
authorities to fly in further aid, Mountain said.
</P>
<P>
"Late last night we got the approval from the Indonesian
authorities to proceed," he said.
</P>
<P>
A second flight could not be expected Friday even though the
United Nations had identified four or five areas of need in East
Timor, Mountain added.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's national flag
carrier Thai Airways International (THAI) has appointed a
consortium of consultants as financial advisers for the airline's
partial privatization, the newspaper The Nation reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
THAI signed an agreement on Thursday with the consortium, led
by Credit Suisse First Boston (Singapore).
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the consortium will submit the
privatization plan to THAI's share-offering committee within six
weeks after the agreement. The committee will then hand over the
plan to the State Enterprise Policy Commission and the cabinet for
further consideration.
</P>
<P>
THAI President Thamnoon Wanglee was quoted as saying the
airline had planned to sell a total of 335 million shares, 235
million of which are held by the Finance Ministry while the
remaining 100 million shares are new. The process is expected to
be completed in February 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
The airline now has 14 billion baht (about 368 million U.S.
dollars) in registered capital. The finance Ministry acquired a
93-percent stake.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution on June 9, 1998, the cabinet approved
a privatization plan for THAI. The first step involves the sale of
both existing shares held by the Finance Ministry and newly-issued
shares of THAI to the extent that the government's holding in THAI
remains at not less than 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Draft Laws to Protect Forests, Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will soon have new
legal weapons to curb forest destruction and energy waste,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the 11th Beijing Municipal People's
Congress (BMPC) yesterday passed the revised versions of two
drafts on forest resources protection and energy conservation.
</P>
<P>
The two will come into effect on November 1 and December 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, natural forests with special
value should not be opened, while the felling of other forests and
woods will be controlled within a standard system.
</P>
<P>
Everyone has the right to stop, inform against and accuse those
who destroy forest resources, said the draft.
</P>
<P>
Those officials who are caught abusing their power or playing
favorites will face criminal or administrative liabilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, applicants for forestry tourism should have usage
certificates and the protection scheme of their targeted forests
as well as a development program. Approval of local forestry
authorities would also be required for applicants to gain other
necessary approvals.
</P>
<P>
As for the measures used, the regulations mainly stipulate that
the municipal government will include energy conservation plans in
its economic and social development plans and will allocate
special funds to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
While energy's proper use should invariably be proven in all
feasibility reports of fixed assets projects meant for the Chinese
capital, the completed projects will not be examined or accepted
by the local government if they fail to satisfy the energy
conservation designs, according to the draft.

<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, the people of Guangxi have transformed
the poverty-stricken region into a place full of vitality.
</P>
<P>
The region has formed a range of industries including machinery,
sugar, building materials, hydropower, chemicals, non-ferrous
metals, and forestry, and is capable of producing a great number
of commodities, including mini-buses.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region also leads the world in the technology
for building arch bridges. By 1998, Guangxi had an installed
hydropower generating capacity of 6.11 million kw. With 110 sugar
factories, Guangxi has developed into the country's largest sugar-
producing base. Last year, it produced 3.8 million tons of sugar.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government's decision in 1992 to make Guangxi
southwest China's thoroughfare to the outside world has created
enormous development opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has been focusing on construction of infrastructure as
a way to improve its investment environment and speed up the

<HEADLINE> Bird Plans to Step Down as Coach of Pacers After 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird confirmed
Wednesday night he plans to step down as coach of the Indiana
Pacers after the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was not surprising since Bird did not sign a
contract extension during the summer. He is entering the third and
final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
"Three years is enough for a coach in any one place," Bird said
Wednesday in a satellite interview from Naples, Florida with WTHR
television. "After the three year I told him (Pacers president
Donnie Walsh) I'd probably be done."
</P>
<P>
Without any previous coaching experience, Bird was named NBA
coach of the year in 1997-98 after he guided the Pacers to a 58-24
record and the seventh game of the Eastern Conference finals,
where they lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Pacers won the Central Division title with a 33-
17 record in the lockout-shortened season, but were upset by the
eighth-seeded New York Knicks 4-2 in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
"After last year, I'm very down from the way we ended up," Bird
said in the interview. "I thought we had a great shot at getting
to the finals, and we didn't do it. This year is going to be no
different. We're going to work hard and I'll expect a lot out of
them."
</P>
<P>
In an effort to inject much-needed youth into a team that was
exposed by the Knicks in the postseason, the Pacers acquired high
school forward Jonathan Bender from the Toronto Raptors for
forward Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
Bender matched Kevin Garnett in 1995 and Darryl Dawkins in 1975
as the high school players selected highest in the history of the
NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
Bird was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year
of eligibility after a brilliant 13-year career with the Boston
Celtics from 1979-80 to 1991-92. He led the Celtics to three NBA
titles, was the league's MVP three straight years and a 12-time
All-Star.
</P>
<P>
Bird served as a consultant and special assistant to the
Celtics for several years before he was named coach of the Pacers
in May 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shooters Chase World's Bests in National City Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Young Chinese sharp
shooters are catching up with the bests in the world by achieving
considerable progresses in their weak events in the Fourth
National City Games.
</P>
<P>
In the 17-event shooting competitions, two shooters surpassed
the world junior records with other four either beating or
leveling the national junior marks.
</P>
<P>
Ge Hong, 20, made the most important impact by surpassing by
two points the world junior mark of 593 points in the men's air
rifle which is a weak point for China, wherein Sun Jianxin also
made the feat.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dongyi scored 1,176 points to beat the world junior record
of 1,173 points for the men's 3x40 shot rifle event, set nine
years ago by a South Korean.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Penghui also broke a 10-year-old national junior mark in
the men's rapid fire pistol event.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of our young shooters show that we have made
some breakthroughs in our traditional weak events," hailed the
officials of the Chinese Shooting Association.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Zhou Jia, 15, became the youngest champion in the
women's trap, one of two weak events for the Chinese women
shooters. The other was the double trap since both events were
out of the Olympic agenda in the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
And Zhao Yinhui, an 18-year-old world record holder, took the
women's 10 meters air rifle title after surpassing the world
junior mark in the preliminaries and beating the national junior
record in the final.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 members of the national squad representing
different cities in the Games, five triumphed and six others
finished runners-up.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of our national team members have displayed a
steady performance and the National City Games generally reflects
their skills and strength," said Sun Shengwei, head coach of the
Chinese national shooting team.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China still enjoys an advantages with a string of
young athletes standing up in its traditional strong events, Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a healthy sign that a few new faces show up here by
beating the national team members," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "We hope to reap the historical feat in the 2000
Olympic Games as we have witnessed the progresses in our weak
events," said Wang Zhuyue, general secretary of the Chinese
Shooting Association.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 40 shooting teams and a string of young
players are maturing after the last national games, which has been
justified by the records set up in the City Games.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to surpass the three golds achieved in the 23rd
Olympic Games by the year 2000," said Wang.

TEGUCIGALPA, September 16 (Xinhua)-- Heavy rain has isolated 40,

Cross confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They said the residents in Juticalpa city, northeast of the
country, have been isolated following extensive damages, caused by
the recent intense rains, to bridges and roads .

Another 70 communities in the country are in a similar
condition, since most of the bridges and roads, which were hastily
built following the pounding by hurricane Mitch last October, have
been washed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recent mud- and stone-slide caught drivers
traveling along the Panamerican Highway, which joins the southern
part of Central America, by surprise.
</P>
<P>
They said that 40 soldiers from the 11th infantry battalion
have begun to clean the stretch of highway, so trucks loaded with
merchandise from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica, can reach
Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Floyd which
slammed into the East Coast of the United States on Thursday,
caused quite a few postponements and cancellations of sports
events as it moves north into New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Over seven inches of rain is expected to fall in New York on
Thursday, and combined with high winds, has made travel extremely
treacherous.
</P>
<P>
Several indoor sporting events have been postponed to keep
people in their homes, including a pair of Nation Hockey League
exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
The New York Rangers postponed their game against the Detroit
Red Wings and did not announce a makeup date. The Philadelphia
Flyers postponed their game against the Washington Capitals and
set September 27 as the reschedule date.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem appears to be in Baltimore, where the
Orioles postponed both Wednesday's and today's games with the
Oakland Athletics. The games were not immediately rescheduled,
but with the Athletics in the middle of the American League wild
card race, they almost certainly will be made up.
</P>
<P>
The Athletics play all but six of their remaining games at home
and the only time they are scheduled to leave California before
the end of the season is for a three-game series at Texas from
September 24-26. Baltimore begins a nine-game road trip Friday
night against the Anaheim Angels and does not have another home
game scheduled until September 28.
</P>
<P>
In addition, four of Saturday's Division I-AA football games
have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
The biggest event of the night is scheduled for Cleveland,
where the Indians are to begin a four-game series with the New
York Yankees in a matchup of American League division leaders.
Barring a shift west by Hurricane Floyd, the game should be played.

<P>
YANGON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will hold its second
tourism fair in Bangkok, Thailand, on September 27 and 28, aiming
to attract more tourists from Thailand and promote the country's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, which sponsors the
fair, has invited local private entrepreneurs to take part in the
fair, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
After initiating with Thailand an accord on cooperation in
tourism in July last year, Myanmar launched its first tourism fair
in Thailand in September that year, which attracted 1,186
entrepreneurs
from 58 tourism companies and two air services of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Thailand plays a key role in supplying tourists to Myanmar
among Myanmar's neighbors and ranks second after Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of tourists who
visited Myanmar in fiscal 1998-99, which ended in March, totaled

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Raises Funds From Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
raised 1.04 billion U.S. dollars from its privatization program in
the first five months of the 1999/2000 fiscal year which ends in
March, The Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
An assistant to State Minister of the Empowerment of State
Enterprises Sofyan Djalil said he was optimistic that this fiscal
year's target of 1.6 billion dollars from the program would be
realized.
</P>
<P>
The government raised 215 million dollars from the sale of its
shares in port operator Pelindo II and 173 million dollars from
Pelindo III.
</P>
<P>
Additional revenue came from the sale of 119.3 million dollars
in stock in food manufacturer PT Indofood Sukses Makmur and 409
million dollars in PT Telkom, a communication firm.
</P>
<P>
The government received 122.1 million dollars from the sale of
14 percent of cement manufacturer PT Semen Gresik to Mexican
cement company Cemex SA.
</P>
<P>
Last fiscal year's privatization proceeds only stood at about
380 million dollars, falling far short of the 1 billion dollars
target.
</P>
<P>
Sofyan promised to announce by early next month whether the
planned consolidation of 144 state firms into 10 holding companies
was going forward.
</P>
<P>
The government named six foreign consultants in early August to
assist in analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the
planned consolidation.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, Sofyan said, the government also plans to
sell some of its shares in state airport operator Angkasa Pura II
and state plantation company PT Perkebunan IV.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the final stages of negotiations with foreign
investors to privatize the two state firms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other state companies to be privatized by the government within
this fiscal year were fertilizer manufacturers PT Pupuk Kaltim and
PT Pusri, plantation company PT Perkebunan III and
international-call operator PT Indosat, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Withdraws Troops From East Timor: Military Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
has begun withdrawing some of its soldiers from East Timor ahead
of the arrival of a multinational force next week, The Jakarta
Post Friday quoted a military source as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the troops are starting to leave for Atambua (a border
town on the western half of Timor island). We expect all soldiers
to be out when the peacekeeping troops arrive," said the source,
who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The source said the military leadership issued an order
recently to withdraw all its troops from East Timor, except for a
small unit of army engineers.
</P>
<P>
There were still one marine unit and 12 army battalions in East
Timor as well as 8,000 police and 5,000 members of the local
military command as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that when the multinational force arrives, TNI
soldiers would assume the role of consultant and liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
TNI Commander Gen. Wiranto said earlier on Thursday that the
withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers would be coordinated with the
arrival of the multinational force.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a retreat. TNI will adjust the size of its
presence in accordance with whatever role it is given by the
United Nations in the multinational force," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday decided to send a
multinational force to East Timor to restore peace and security
there and protect the U.N. officials in continuing their work for
the implementation of the August 30 direct ballot which showed
support for East Timor's independence over autonomy within
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Australian-led multinational force to
East Timor is expected to arrive on Sunday or Monday. An advance
team will be in Dili, capital of East Timor, this weekend.

<P>
NANNING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region plans to make full use of its rich natural
resources and geographic advantages to achieve greater economic
progress.
</P>
<P>
Cao Bochun, Secretary of the Autonomous Regional Communist
Party of China (CPC) Committee, said they will also step up
integrating science and technology with the economy and
unswervingly adhere to the road of reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, with a population of 46.23 million, borders Vietnam
and abounds in mineral, waterpower, marine and tourist resources.
</P>
<P>
It is home to 114 kinds of minerals, 87 of which have verified
reserves, and has 937 rivers with an estimated waterpower capacity
of 237.9 million kw, vast beautiful karst landscape with the
picturesque city of Guilin as a typical example, as well as 53
gulfs with a total area of 1,254 sq km, five of which can be used
to build deep-water berths.
</P>
<P>
As early as October 1997, the Guangxi Regional Government put
forward three major strategies for building the autonomous region
into five economic zones in the northern, southern, eastern,
western and central parts, using opening-up as a propelling force
and concentrating efforts on taking advantage of Guangxi's rich
natural resources.

The Australian Financial Review:

CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Peter Nicol finally went

finalist beat Egyptian Ahmed Barada to take the crown on Thursday.

The 26-year-old Scot second seed took 65 minutes to dispatch
third-seeded Barada 15-9, 15-13, 15-11 in the final to become the

with his 22-year-old opponent, a former world junior champion,

<HEADLINE> IAAF Urges National Federations to Suspend Sotomayor, Ottey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) has pressed for the national
federations of Cuba and Jamaica to impose ban on high jumper
Javier Sotomayor and sprinter Merlene Ottey for doping failures.
</P>
<P>
"It is a normal procedure and we do that in every doping case
as soon as the B samples prove positive too, regardless of the
athlete's fame or celebrity," IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
The urge came as Cuban authorities repeatedly said they would
stand by Sotomayor, the world record holder, who failed a dope
test for cocaine at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
</P>
<P>
The athletics' world ruling body also prompted the Jamaica
Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) to take action against Ottey,
whose second urine sample had just been tested positive.
</P>
<P>
The JAAA will conduct a hearing by November to determine
whether it will suspend Ottey from competitions for two years.
</P>
<P>
Ottey tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in
Lucerne, Switzerland in July and the IAAF disclosed Thursday that
the 39-year-old sprinter's "B" sample on September 2, the second
urine test, also has tested positive for the drug.
</P>
<P>
"There are international rules regarding athletes who have had
positive dope tests and they should be applied by all national
federations.
</P>
<P>
"But it is up to the national federation to make a decision."
said Reineri.

<HEADLINE> East China's Meizhou Bay Attracts Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Meizhou Bay in east China's
Fujian Province has become a popular place for starting up new
businesses among domestic and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Well over 100 business people from 17 countries and regions
attended the international promotion fair of the northern bank of
Meizhou Bay held earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
During that fair, contracts were signed for more than 37
projects which will require a total investment of 220 million U.S.
dollars, and 13 projects involve overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the middle coast of Fujian Province, Meizhou Bay is
a good natural deep-water port where 60 new berths can be
constructed. It is also the site for the State-planned
construction of a port industrial city and an international trans-
shipping port.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, a special committee was set up to take
responsibility for economic development and management of the
northern bank of the bay.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, 10 billion yuan (about 8.27 billion U.
S. dollars) was spent on infrastructure and fixed assets
investment in the northern bank of Meizhou Bay.
</P>
<P>
To date, 57 overseas-funded projects have been approved for the
area, with contracts worth 1.8 billion U.S. dollars of overseas
investment, of which over 600 million U.S. dollars have already
been received.

<HEADLINE> U.S. PAC-3 Missile Again Hits Target Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military
conducted another successful test of a Patriot Advanced Capability
(PAC-3) Missile Thursday at White Sands Missile Range in New
Mexico State, the United States, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The PAC-3 Missile, an improved version of Patriots used against
Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf War in 1991, intercepted and
destroyed the incoming tactical ballistic missile target, and
preliminary test data indicated all test objectives were
successfully achieved, a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second successful high-speed intercept of a Hera
by the PAC-3, being developed by Lockheed Martin Corp. of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The test program for the new Patriot, which will include
another 15 shots at different types of target missiles, is part of
a U.S. program to develop defenses against short- and medium-range
missiles fired at troops and bases.
</P>
<P>
So far, the PAC-3 has successfully completed four missions. The
first two were development tests with special instrument packages
instead of the seeker.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan to develop anti-missile interceptors violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty between Moscow and
Washington, and the United States is now pressing Russia to agree
to make some modifications to the treaty to provide for any such
deployment.

<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Former champions Juventus and
Ajax Amsterdam had easy victories against their rivals in UEFA Cup
soccer matches on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, defending champions Parma struggled in their opening
match on Thursday, beating Ukrainians Kryvbas Kryvih Rih 3-2 in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The two vital away goals for the well-organized and effective
Ukrainians mean that a poor-looking Parma, without a win in Serie
A this season, now have a tough fight on their hands to progress
in the away leg.
</P>
<P>
Parma were lucky not to be seriously embarrassed on a rainy
night in the Tardini stadium after the Ukrainians pushed for an
equaliser and twice forced goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to make
diving saves in the final stages.
</P>
<P>
Kryvbas striker Olexandr Palyantsa stunned Parma with a well-
taken goal after just five minutes but two goals from Marco Di
Vaio, a summer signing from Salernitana, put Parma back in control
by the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
A Dino Baggio header made it 3-1 in the 67th minute but
substitute Roman Monaryov pulled one back in the 74th after just
two minutes on the field.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, Europe's top side in 1996 who were forced to qualify
through the Intertoto Cup this season under former Parma coach
Carlo Ancelotti, thrashed Omonia Nicosia 5-2 in Cyprus with four
goals coming in the opening 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Italian international striker Alessandro del Piero, easing back
into the limelight after 10 months on the sidelines, came on as a
second-half substitute and scored the fifth eight minutes from
time.
</P>
<P>
Ajax, the side that beat Juventus for the 1995 European Cup,
rolled past Slovakia's Dukla Banska Bystrica 6-1, with the Slovak
side only scoring through an own goal.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch side went behind to the Slovaks after the 14th-minute
Frank Verlaat own goal but the same player made amends by
equalising with a 25th minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
Martijn Reuser made it 2-1 a minute later and then the
floodgates opened in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Celtic, the 1967 European champions, also started off with a 2-
0 win at home to Israel's Hapoel Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Belgian side Anderlecht returned victoriously but
unconvincingly to European competition after a one-year ban
imposed for irregularities surrounding their appearance in the
1984 final.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians beat nine-man Olimpija Ljubljana 3-1 but failed to
cash in on their numerical advantage for much of the second half
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Former England manager Bobby Robson also returned to European
competition with his new club Newcastle United and watched them
beat CSKA Sofia 2-0 thanks to goals from Peruvian Nolberto Solano
and Georgian Temuri Ketsbaia.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Russia to Fight Corruption (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday urged Russia to fight against
corruption and other crimes while defending the administration's
policy towards the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment, Albright warned that aid to
Russia will be at risk because of corruption. "We have made clear
that we will not support further multilateral assistance to Russia
unless fully adequate safeguards are in place," she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said Washington had called on Moscow to "bring
under control the epidemic of crime and corruption," but "the
response from Russian authorities has not been adequate."
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, Vice President Al Gore took the lead in pressing
Russia to enact money laundering and anti-crime legislation,"
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the response from Russian authorities has not
been adequate. President (Boris) Yeltsin's government needs at
last to make fighting corruption a priority."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, reports said that billions of U.S. dollars
including some financial aid from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) were diverted illegally from Russia to offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
The accusation has caused the IMF and the Clinton
administration under fire. Some U.S. politicians urged to halt
any further loans to Russia before safeguarding measures were
taken to prevent any misuse or illegal diversion of the money.
</P>
<P>
Both IMF and the U.S. administration denied they had any
evidence to show that the money that had been diverted illegally
came from the IMF emergency loans, or bilateral aid from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of having the fullest possible
investigation," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has sent a group of experts to Washington this week for
talks with the U.S. over the case while the U.S. Congress prepares
for hearings next week on whether any U.S. aid to Russia had been
misused.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian legal system remains no match for well-connected
criminals, and the tentacles of Russian organized crime have
spread far beyond the nation's borders," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to Russian leaders has been to get tough on
corruption and to cooperate in full with investigations into it,
including money laundering and the use of IMF funds, no matter
where or to whom the evidence leads," she added.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress said the scandal shows the Clinton
administration's policy towards Russia is a failure. However,
Albright expressed his opposition to the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
"The suggestion that Russia is lost is simply wrong," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated the two goals of the U.S. policy towards
Russia: to increase the safety of the American people by working
to reduce Cold War arsenals, stop proliferation and create a
stable and undivided Europe; to support Russia's efforts to
transform its political, economic, social institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Neither of these goals has been fully achieved, but neither
has been lost. Each remains a work in progress, and we remain
determined to work with Russia and our allies to accomplish
each," she added.

<HEADLINE> Britain, U.S. Considering Suspending Iraq Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United States
are considering to suspend United Nations sanctions on Iraq's
imports of civilian goods if Baghdad cooperates with a new
disarmament system, reports here said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which means a significant concession by the two
most hawkish powers against Iraq, had been discussed at a meeting
of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in
London on Wednesday, a report quoted a British official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States are scheduled to meet in New York on Friday to try to find
a resolution to ease some of the sanctions on Iraq in force since
the 1990-91 Gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
London and Washington, the two governments that bombarded Iraq
for four days late last year to punish President Saddam Hussein
for obstructing U.N. weapon monitors, had previously been prepared
only to contemplate suspending sanctions on Iraqi exports and
allowing some foreign investment in the vital oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
A British official said on Thursday that if sufficient progress
was made by officials, foreign ministers of the Big Five might
meet late next week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York to
seek a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Arms inspections on Iraq, which were meant to eliminate Iraq's
arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, was led to a
standstill earlier this year when the inspectors sent to Iraq by
the United Nations were proved to be spying for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed not to let inspectors back in and demanded
nothing less than a total lifting of the sanctions, which it
blames for high infant mortality and widespread deprivation.

<HEADLINE> German Foreign Minister Favors Turkey's EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer Thursday strongly urged the European Union (EU) to give
Turkey a concrete perspective of entering the bloc.
</P>
<P>
"We can not abandon Turkey," said Fischer while taking part in
the parliamentary debate at the Reichstag building in Berlin,
adding: "There is no alternative to accepting Turkey into the EU."
</P>
<P>
Turkey will be further pulled into self-isolation if the EU
does not give the country any perspective of acceptance, stressed
Fischer, saying there would be "fatal sequences" if the EU close
its door to the country.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul has been applying for EU membership for a decade with
futile effort. The EU says the human right situation in the
country is not satisfying and denounces its military actions to
put down the Kurdish rebellion.
</P>
<P>
While pleading for "realism" in relationship with Turkey,
Fischer said the EU should not block Turkey's entrance to the EU.
</P>
<P>
He called on Romano Prodi, the new president of European
Commission, to draw up "an accurate timetable" for the EU's
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Guenter Verheugen, the outgoing state minister of foreign
affairs and the new EU commissar, shared Fischer's viewpoint and
set the goal as "political and geophysical unification" of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs, the Croats, and the Albanians also should be offered
a seat in Europe, Verheugen indicated further.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey must realize democracy and respect human rights
before the EU can accept it, said Verheugen, adding: "What applies
to all the EU members, applies to Turkey, too.".

<P>
BRASILIA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Gabriel
Mugabe met here Thursday to exchange opinions concerning the
strengthening of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Mugabe talked about his
government's difficulties in fighting against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Brazil together with Cuba are going to offer Zimbabwe help in
the fight against AIDS, as 25 percent of the adult population of
this African country is infected by AIDS and 1,200 casualties are
registered weekly from AIDS, according to facts published by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also attended the signing of an accord of
cooperation and cultural exchange between both countries regarding
scenic arts, literature, sports and tourism.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe told a press conference here this afternoon
that his visit is to increase cooperation with this important
South American country in all areas, mainly agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He added his country is interested in importing Brazilian
agricultural machinery.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe will be in Sao Paulo on Friday. In the largest
Brazilian city he will meet Brazilian businessmen and visit
Brazil's Aeronautic Company (Embraer).

<HEADLINE> Annan: UN Should Take Action to Protect Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
should take action in the name of the principles of the Charter and
the values of humanity to protect the civilians in armed conflict,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement at the Security Council's open
debate on his recommendations to protect the civilians in armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Annan said to address the issue, the United Nations must be
ready to respond with more than meetings, speeches and reports.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement action would need to be undertaken, said
Annan, but adding "There must of course be objective criteria to
determine the threshold for any form of intervention."
</P>
<P>
In his report the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict
submitted to the Security Council early this week, Annan
proposed measures of protecting the civilians in armed conflict
for the Council to consider.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves First Policy Based Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Thursday a 250 million U.S. dollar Policy Based Guarantee
Operation to support a market borrowing by the government of
Argentina to strengthen its presence in international market. The
operation is the first of its kind to be issued by the bank.
</P>
<P>
The policy Based Guarantee instrument was approved by the World
Bank's board in April 1999 to extend the bank's existing partial
guarantee program beyond investment projects to sovereign
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
This guarantee instrument has been designed to support emerging
economies with a strong track-record of macroeconomic stability
and growth, but whose access to international financial markets is
temporarily constrainted.
</P>
<P>
As one of Latin America's most successful reformers, the bank
said, Argentina has achieved price stability, opened its borders
to trade, privatized public enterprises, restructured public
administration, and reformed the pension system.
</P>
<P>
Critically, the country has started the process of restoring
social services, especially social safety nets, education, and
health, the bank said. The World Bank's assistance in Argentina is
aimed at restoring economic growth while safeguarding these social
programs which play a central role in alleviating poverty, it
added.
</P>
<P>
To that effect, the World Bank approved in November 1998 two
special operations for Argentina totaling 3 billion dollars: a
Special Structural Adjustment Loan (SSAL) of 2.5 billion dollars,
and a Special Repurchase Facility Support Loan of 500 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new rolling reinstatable guarantee, applicable on both
interest and principal, will support Argentina's issuance of a
series of six zero coupon notes each for a face value of 250
million dollars, to be fully repaid within a five-year period.
With the issuance of the notes and the guarantee, Argentina will
cancel 250 million dollars from the second tranche of the SSAL.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Gives Up Seat in Italian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- New European Commission
President Romano Prodi was back in Rome Thursday in order to give
up his seat in the Italian Lower House, but he assured his
compatriots that while he was leaving parliament, he was not
leaving his country.
</P>
<P>
"Today I leave this parliament, but I do not leave this country
because, at this point, Italy's destiny lies completely within the
framework of a more united and internationally prestigious
Europe," said Prodi, whose powers as neo-Commission president
became effective as of Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old former Italian premier and his new 19-strong
team were confirmed by the European Parliament in Strasbourg
Wednesday, putting an end to a six-month crisis triggered by the
resignation of the last Commission amid charges of mismanagement,
corruption and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also pledged himself to the reform and modernization of
the European Union's executive body and told the European
Parliament that he will make it a transparent and accountable one.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema told the parliament afterwards
that "This is a day of great importance for our country, and Prodi
could count on Italy's support in his new and difficult role.

<HEADLINE> At Least Six Killed in Hurricane Floyd in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were
killed as Hurricane Floyd ploughed into North Carolina and
Virginia States of the United States Thursday, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Floyd roared ashore Thursday near Cape Fear with 170 kph wind,
then quickly weakened after flooding the coasts of North Carolina
and Virginia States with more than 0.3 meters of rain and chasing
tens of thousands of people into shelters.
</P>
<P>
By 5 p.m. (GMT 2300) Thursday, as the center of the storm was
about 16 kilometers south of Atlantic City, New Jersey State, it
was downgraded to a tropical storm again as sustained winds fell
to 100 kph.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.4 million utility customers from South Carolina State to
New Jersey State lost power, and 125,000 still had no power
Thursday in Florida State. Flooding and power failures combined to
shut down Portsmouth, Virginia's water supply system, which serves
110,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
Schools were closed in Washington D.C., Virginia State, New
York City. Hundreds of airline flights have been canceled along
the East Coast. All train service south of Washington has been
suspended and was not expected to restore service until Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton declared a major disaster Thursday
in North Carolina, and released 528 million U.S. dollars to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to help hurricane victims.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed with most indexes falling Thursday after several companies
issued warnings on their lower-than-expected profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 63.96 at
10,737.46. The blue chip index fell as much as 171 points in
trading.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index also fell 7.45
at 2,806.72. But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 0.51 at
1,318.48.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged as a number of companies said their
profits would be lower than expected. FDX Corp., the parent of
Federal Express, reported it earned 52 cents per share in its
fiscal first quarter, less than 54 cents expected earlier.
</P>
<P>
Quintiles Transnational Corp. said its third quarter
earnings will be about 9 cent below the expectations, dragging
stocks lower. The marketing and research company focuses on
the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
Fears about higher interest rates also helped pushing the
market lower. The Federal Reserve said in a report that U.S.
industrial production continued to climb in August and the
investors worried that the robust economy would prompt the
Federal Reserve raise interest rates to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE fell 1.15 at 607.32 and the American Stock Exchange
index fell 6.68 at 790.80. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies fell 6.08 at 430.25.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,064 down, 916 up and 529
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 723.22 million share from 779.58
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Relaxes Encryption Technology Export Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Thursday relaxed U.S. control on the export of data
encryption technology, a move long sought by the domestic computer
industry and resisted by federal law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
The move was a defeat for the Justice Department, which had
forcefully argued that criminals and terrorists might use the
technology to scramble messages about crimes or deadly plots.
</P>
<P>
Critics of restrictions on export sales said criminals and
terrorists already could buy or download powerful encryption
technology made in other countries.
</P>
<P>
To help law enforcement, the White House will urge Congress to
give the FBI 80 million U.S. dollars over four years to develop
techniques to break messages scrambled by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The decision should help U.S. companies in overseas
competition.
</P>
<P>
The administration will allow high-tech companies to sell even
the most powerful encryption technology overseas to private and
commercial customers after a one-time technical review of their
products.
</P>
<P>
But the White House will still require companies to seek
permission to sell the scrambling technology to a foreign
government or military and it maintains bans on selling to seven
nations accused of terrorism: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan,
North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the administration allowed companies to sell the
most powerful scrambling technology only to specific industries
overseas; other foreign customers were generally limited to
so-called 56-bit encryption products, meaning those with
72-quadrillion unlocking combinations.
</P>
<P>
Critics cited more than 800 products available worldwide with
stronger scrambling technology than the United States allowed its
companies to sell overseas.
</P>
<P>
A non-profit group of researchers demonstrated last summer it
can unscramble a 56-bit coded message in just days using a
custom-built computer worth less than 250,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force to Get into East Timor Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The newly-authorized
multinational force is expected to go into East Timor sometime in
the next few days, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A major military operation was underway Thursday in Darwin,
Australia, which is expected to send an advance team over the
weekend or early next week, according to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian and Australian military officials continued their
talks in New York Thursday "in a cordial and businesslike manner",
said Eckhard, adding that "They are progressing well towards the
understanding of the relationship on the ground between the
multinational force and the Indonesian Army".
</P>
<P>
"It is not our impression that the Indonesian military are
pulling out of East Timor," he said, denying reports that the
military would pull out when the multinational force went in.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said that the
peace-keeping mission would be conducted in cooperation between
the Indonesian military and the international force with the
former playing an advisory or liaison role and the latter in
command.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has so far not announced the composition and
leadership. Eckhard said he understood that Australia would let
individual countries to announce their troop contribution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Wednesday decided to send a
multinational force to East Timor to restore peace and security
there and protect the U.N. to continue its work for the
implementation of the August 30 referendum which showed support
for East Timor's independence over its autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has reported the "liquidation" of anti-independence
militia in Baucau, a town about 100 kilometers east of Dili, the
capital but the militia "was very much in evidence" around Dili
Thursday, Eckhard said.
