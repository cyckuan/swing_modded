DESKTOPS OFFER STUDENTS VERSATILITY  By BECKY WARING 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A home computer has become an absolute necessity
for school-age children. Fortunately, prices have fallen so far
that most families should be able to afford one. Whether for
homework, Web cruising, e-mail or game-playing, the computer will
likely become the focal point of many home activities. Here's how
to choose one with the right features and the right price.
</P>
<P>
   We have chosen three PCs for varying budgets, plus an Apple iMac
model. All have everything your child needs for school activities.
Some go a lot further, such as adding multimedia playback
capabilities and even the ability to make your own music CDs.
Buying the best you can afford provides some measure of protection
against premature obsolescence, always a consideration with
computer purchases. You will also likely get a much more versatile
and expandable machine.
</P>
<P>
   As for buying the computer, we recommend scouting out the
build-to-order options on most every vendor's Web site (Apple,
Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and Sony all have extensive
online stores, among others). This lets you save money by tailoring
a system to your exact needs.
</P>
<P>
   Features to Look For:
</P>
<P>
   -- Processor/RAM. Budget-conscious desktop buyers looking for
deals for less than $1,000 should consider models with Intel
Celeron and AMD K6-2 processors. Clock speeds around 500 MHz are
just fine for most schoolwork and game playing. You will compromise
on things like 3-D and video horsepower. For serious multimedia
capabilities, look to the Intel Pentium III line and clock speeds
in the 600 to 700 MHz range. Don't overspend on the clock speed
however. A couple hundred extra bucks is probably better allocated
to more memory (get at least 64 MB, or 128 MB for multimedia) and
add-ons such as a CD recorder.
</P>
<P>
   -- Software/Operating System. We recommend Windows 98 over
Windows 2000 for both portables and desktops due to ease-of-use and
compatibility issues. Windows Millennium Edition is coming soon,
however, and may even be shipping by the time you get around to
buying. At the least, ask your salesperson if you can get a coupon
for an upgrade to Window ME when you buy your new computer.
</P>
<P>
   All our recommended systems (except the iMac) include Microsoft
Word and virus-scanning utilities. Most also include an array of
home and educational software. If you are buying a first computer,
online build-to-order vendors like Dell and Gateway also offer
special add-on software value packs that are inexpensive ways to
start building your library.
</P>
<P>
   -- Storage. It's a general rule that however much hard-disk
space you buy, you will quickly fill it up, especially in these
days of huge digital-camera picture files and MP3 music downloads.
We have therefore ``specced out'' our recommended systems with
hefty hard disks, typically 20 to 30 GB. On the higher-end systems,
we also recommend a DVD-ROM drive. You will likely want to add it
on in the near future, and it's cheaper and easier to get it built
in. Another popular extra is a CD-recorder, which is included in
the Sony multimedia-oriented system in our chart. You can add it on
to most build-to-order models.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expansion. All the PC desktops in our chart have plenty of
expansion capability, being tower models. The compact iMac is an
exception. The PCs have varying numbers of USB ports (the new
standard for attaching peripherals like printers and scanners),
serial and parallel ports, and miscellaneous audio and video
connections. They also have extra PCI slots and drive bays for
internal expansion. Because there are so many different home
networking schemes, we didn't price the systems with Ethernet, but
add about $50 for a network card if you need one.
</P>
<P>
   -- Monitor. All our choices include a monitor in the price;
there are two 15-inch models, and two 17-inchers. The extra $100 or
so for a 17-inch monitor is well worth the price. There's more
screen real estate for viewing Web sites and working with multiple
applications, or you can use the extra space to increase pixel size
and ease eyestrain. The 15-inch screens are usually viewed at
800x600 or 1024x768, 17-inchers at 1024x768 or 1280x1024. A given
resolution, for example 1024x768, that looks cramped at 15 inches
will be easy to read at 17 inches.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to splurge, you might also consider a
flat-screen LCD monitor. These are a lot more expensive than
traditional CRT monitors, but look great and save space.
</P>
<P>
   -- Warranty and Technical Support. Of the four vendors shown
here, Dell has the most generous warranty and tech support
features. Other vendors tend to limit the amount of time you can
make calls related to software issues, although all have one-year
hardware warranty and tech support. All four vendors have excellent
online tech support areas, which are the first place to turn when
you have a problem or need a software driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Saver:
</P>
<P>
   -- Dell Dimension L566cx. Dell is sort of the Wal-Mart of
computing: It has all the most popular products at the lowest
prices possible, backed by good quality and service. The Dimension
line goes all the way to the high end, but we chose the entry-level
model as a paragon of price and performance. The L566cx has all the
basics for home and education, just lacking bells and whistles such
as DVD drives and superfast processors. Keep in mind that you can
customize any Dell with various add-ons, so be careful not to run
up the bill when you start shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-Priced Speedster:
</P>
<P>
   -- HP Pavilion. HP's Pavilion line is squarely aimed at the home
user and offers excellent value for the money. Rather than going
for one of the off-the-shelf models, we specced out a machine with
a 17-inch screen, 733 MHz Pentium III, top-notch video card,
DVD-ROM drive, 128 MB of RAM and 15 GB hard disk for just $1,271.
It also comes with all the right consumer software in a
well-designed case. What more can you ask? Well, maybe a
CD-rewritable drive or inkjet printer, two bases that HP has
covered in spades, being a market leader in each. Just add them to
your build-to-order list.
</P>
<P>
   The Multimedia Maven:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sony PCV-R553DS VAIO Digital Studio. If you want to go beyond
the basics to get a real multimedia powerhouse, Sony's Digital
Studio lives up to its name. It has an almost dizzying array of
software for editing digital images and movies, even creating Web
video, and has built-in i.LINK (IEEE 1394) ports for DV camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, it has dual DVD-ROM and CD-RW drives. This lets you
copy files easily from one to the other, for backup purposes or for
making custom CD-audio mix discs. The 17-inch flat Trinitron screen
is also much higher quality than the run-of-the-mill models you
will find in most consumer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac Alternative:
</P>
<P>
   -- Apple iMac DV+. Apple rolled out its new iMac line a couple
weeks ago. As usual, the focus is on multimedia. If you have seen
Apple's TV commercials, you have already guessed that the iMac DV
is the cheapest and easiest way to get into editing video with your
DV camcorder. We recommend the iMac DV+ for its 30 GB hard disk,
DVD-ROM drive and 450 MHz PowerPC G3 processor, which outperforms
Pentium IIIs with much higher clock speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac DV+ is also a great multimedia playback machine, with
its Harman-Kardon speakers, fast video card with 3-D acceleration
and special theater-screen mode, which increases brightness while
playing movies. In a dorm room, it can double as an entertainment
center for CDs and DVD movies.

AS MERCKER RECOVERS, BELCHER LENDS SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It wasn't exactly a ``go get 'em'' that Tim
Belcher gave Anaheim Angels teammate Kent Mercker Saturday night,
when Mercker went out to face the New York Yankees just three
months after suffering a life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him what an enviable position he was in,'' Belcher said
before Sunday's game at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `You're in a no-lose situation. It doesn't
matter what you do, whether you pitch great or get hammered, people
are going to applaud you. Enjoy it. It's the only time in your
career that'll happen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker said he felt fine Sunday, the day after his first
big-league start since May 11, saying he can't wait for his next
start. If the rotation remains as it is, it'll be Thursday night at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Said Angels manager Mike Scioscia: ``He came out of (the first
start) fine. I think in the near future, he'll be pitching much
deeper into games. I think his confidence is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker threw 74 pitches in 3 innings of a game the Angels
eventually won 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quotable: Scioscia, talking about Jose Canseco's home run in
the eighth inning Saturday night, which ended up deep into the
left-center-field seats:
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it come down yet? I heard it hit the guy in the Pluto suit
at Disneyland in the back of the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Under the Halo: Right fielder Tim Salmon didn't start Sunday
because of a strained right groin in Saturday's game but pinch hit
in the eighth inning and singled. It was Salmon's first pinch-hit
appearance of the season. Salmon is expected to be ready to start
Tuesday night's game in Toronto, the start of a nine-game trip that
includes stops in New York and Boston. . . . Disabled closer Troy
Percival is expected to begin light throwing at midweek. He has
been sidelined since Aug. 5 because of tendinitis in his right
elbow. . . . The three games with the Yankees drew 129,974, an
average of 43,325. But, despite being in the thick of the American
League wild-card race, and with an explosive offensive club, the
Angels are averaging 25,412, a drop of nearly a quarter-million
fans from last year when they finished 22 games under .500. The
series with the Yankees did establish an Edison Field (2-year-old)
record for a three-game series, topping the 127,446 for the Dodgers
in July 1999. . . . The grand slam by Troy Glaus Saturday night was
the sixth allowed this season by the Yankees, equaling the
second-highest total in club history. The record is eight in 1995.
. . . Among rookie managers, and managers in their first season
with a new club, the Angels' Scioscia is tied with Cleveland's
Charlie Manuel for the most wins, 61. Others: Colorado's Buddy Bell
is at 58, Detroit's Phil Garner 55, the Chicago Cubs' Don Baylor
53, Baltimore's Mike Hargrove 51 and Milwaukee's Davey Lopes 48.

FOX URGES OPENING OF U.S.-MEXICAN BORDER TO BUILD NEW PARTNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 25th graf starting: In a rare, etc., delete reference to
Guanajuato bordering Texas. It does not.) By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL, Mexico _ Looking ahead to his first visit to the
United States since winning Mexico's most democratic presidential
election in 71 years, Vicente Fox said Sunday that he will press
U.S. officials to open the border to Mexican workers and denounced
the violence against them.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings this month with President Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Mexican president-elect
said he will also begin dialogue about the formation of a North
American common market. Referring to the successes of the European
Union, Fox said that it would promote economic cooperation rather
than competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never be that good friend, that good neighbor, that
good partner as long as Mexico is lagging way behind in
development,'' Fox said. ``I think it is a solidarity issue. It is
a wisdom issue. It is a talent issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the market, by itself, will do the job,'' he
went on. ``This job has to be done by the intelligence of people,
by the intelligence of governments, by the talent of our nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his election on July 2, Fox has become a towering figure
in Mexico, both because he stands 6 foot 5 inches in his signature
cowboy boots and because he is the first man to seize the
presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party since
1929.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and talkative, speaking in fluent English, the
President-elect met with U.S. reporters at his mother's sprawling,
colonial hacienda to discuss his ideas for addressing some of the
most contentious grievances in Mexico's relationship with the
United States, including immigration, the fight against drug
trafficking and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At many points throughout the 90-minute meeting, he spoke with
candor unique among Mexican politicians about his country's
failings and its continuing need for foreign assistance, and he
encouraged U.S. officials to do the same when he meets Clinton and
Gore on Aug. 24, and Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, the
following day in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about immigration, Fox, a former executive for
Coca-Cola in Mexico, called the labor force one of his nation's
greatest assets. He said he will push for the creation of new
programs that would allow Mexicans to hold temporary jobs legally
in the United States _ including everything from unskilled
gardeners to qualified computer programmers. This would mean, he
noted, that Mexicans would not be forced to risk their lives
crossing the border as illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``American labor has its own point of view, which I respect,''
Fox said, when asked about anticipated opposition to such ideas
from U.S. labor unions. ``But the United States also knows very
well that it needs people to grow, that the United States economy
cannot grow at rates of 5 percent or more if you don't have
Mexicans there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a country that was built up by immigrants,'' he said of
his northern neighbor. ``I don't know why today immigrants should
be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he would tell Clinton that the violence against Mexican
immigrants on U.S. ranches along the border _ violence in which at
least three immigrants have been killed this year _ is ``not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``we are more intelligent than to accept that as
a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understands clearly that illegal immigration into the
United States is largely caused by poverty, unemployment and hunger
in Mexico, and in order to keep Mexican workers home, he intends to
turn his campaign promises of 7 percent annual economic growth and
350,000 new jobs a year into reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to have a harmonious, stable border. It is
not possible to solve the migration problem if we don't solve the
gap where a worker in Mexico earns $5 a day, and a worker in the
United States makes $60 a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fox went on. ``Migration can be handled with different
alternatives,'' he said. ``By building up walls, by putting up
armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every border state
is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reinforcing the border, Fox proposes slowly tearing
it down by expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement into a
treaty that creates an open market and a freer flow of services,
goods and workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, they don't compete within each other,'' he said,
referring to the 15-nation European Union, in which citizens of any
one country can work in any other member nation, and passport
controls have also largely been abolished. ``The countries that are
involved, they are partners, so they take all the advantages that
each one has and they put them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine the huge potential of Mexico, the United
States and Canada 20, 30, 40 years from now,'' he added. ``The
capacity of this bloc of nations would be the best in the world. We
three countries would be absolute winners.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to seek similar open market agreements among
some of the members of Mercosur _ Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
Mexico and these three nations, he said, could be ``the four
machines'' that could move Latin America forward and make it a real
power in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said that most of his meetings in Washington, and in
Dallas with Bush, would be informal opportunities to meet and
greet, he would strongly propose an end to the U.S.
drug-certification program. Under the program, the U.S. Congress
annually certifies that Mexico and other individual Latin American
countries where there is a substantial drug trade are meeting
certain standards for combating the illegal traffic. Those
countries that do not meet the standards face an array of possible
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The program has long been criticized by Latin American
presidents as interventionist. Fox said he shared that view, but in
addition, he said the program is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not serving any purpose,'' he said. ``Drug trafficking
is growing, drug consumption in the United States is growing, the
introduction of drugs to the United States is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said that he would consider ``very positively'' U.S.
law enforcement efforts to win the extradition of suspected drug
traffickers, an issue long the focus of acrimony between Mexico and
Washington. And he promised that, under his government, it would be
harder for criminals to bribe their way out of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his hopes for his visit to the United States, he
said, ``I want to approach the United States with intelligence. I
don't want to approach it with pressures and complaints. I want to
sit down with the United States and talk long-term and short-term,
and to build, not to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment of evasiveness, Fox backed away from questions
about which of the U.S. presidential candidates seemed more of a
friend to Mexico. He said he had met previously with Bush when Fox
served as governor of Guanajuato, and he would meet Gore for the
first time in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, he said, have appeared interested in improving
relations with Mexico, even if only for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin vote will be very important,'' he said. ``This will
oblige them to really be serious, to really be committed to Latin
America and to Latin Americans living in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to characterize relations between Mexico and the United
States, he smiled and said, ``The thing I have always said is that
it is a difficult relationship. Sometimes we declare love for each
other, but sometimes we give bear hugs _ too tight an embrace, and
so someone gets hurt.''

YANKEES COAST TO VICORY OVER ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Roger Clemens came to baseball as a power
pitcher, and after agreeing to a contract with the New York Yankees
that will endure beyond his 40th birthday, Clemens said he intended
to finish his career as a power pitcher. When he can't throw hard,
he won't throw at all.
</P>
<P>
   And Clemens still throws very hard. The best working definition
of a power pitcher _ radar guns not required _ may be how opposing
hitters respond in late-afternoon shadows. Facing Clemens on Sunday
evening, the Anaheim Angels reacted as if they heard his fastball
better than they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (10-6) scattered four hits over six and two-thirds
innings and helped shut down the Angels, 4-1, salvaging the last
game of the three-game series for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is expected to sign his contract extension this week. He
is obligated to play two years for the Yankees and the Yankees are
obligated to pay him $30.9 million for the 2001 and 2002 seasons,
an average of $15.45 million a year, the highest salary in baseball
history. It will be the fourth time in Clemens's career that he
will hold the distinction of earning the highest annual average
salary of any pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He has 257 career victories and 3,446 career strikeouts. He only
struck out two on Sunday night, but he was overpowering; there was
no hiding his aggressive approach in the early innings of this
game, which started at 5 p.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   The sun sets behind the stands on the third-base side here, and
when the game started, the shadows cloaked the 60 feet 6 inches
between home plate and the rubber on the mound. The lights of
Edison Field were turned on, but they had no effect until the third
inning. These are almost the worst possible conditions for hitting,
and Clemens seized the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 14 pitches in the first inning, 14 fastballs, ranging
from 92 to 95 mph, and there was nothing but unsure swings from the
Angels, who were flailing in the dark. Clemens started the second
inning with a 92-mile-an-hour fastball and needed only 10 pitches
in the inning, mixing in a couple of split-fingered fastballs and a
slider.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens threw 13 pitches in the third inning, all fastballs, and
it was not until the fourth that his velocity, perhaps drained by
his early-inning offensive, was diminished and he began to mix in
more splitters and sliders.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Ramon Ortiz outpitched Boston's Pedro Martinez last
week, armed with a repertory of fastballs and sliders. He is a
power pitcher, like Clemens, and the Yankees took many weak swings
against him on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees offered passive resistance: they patiently waited
for Ortiz to throw strikes, and he could not do so consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams walked to open the second, and David Justice was
hit by a pitch. Tino Martinez flied out and Jose Canseco whiffed,
but Jose Posada walked, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius fell behind in the count, one ball and two
strikes, and fouled off three straight pitches before drawing three
straight pitches out of the strike zone for a run-scoring walk.
After two innings, the Yankees had more runs (1) than hits (0).
</P>
<P>
   They added a run in the fourth in similar fashion. Justice poked
a single through the right side with a no-ball, two-strike count,
and Ortiz walked Martinez and Posada. Bases loaded once more.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz began working from the windup, and the Yankees' bench was
working over Eric Cooper, the first-base umpire. It appeared that
Coach Don Zimmer, Manager Joe Torre and others were claiming that
Ortiz was balking as he prepared to throw pitches to Jose Vizcaino.
Stationed on the first-base line, Cooper kept glancing into the
Yankees' dugout and responding viscerally to the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his lead off first base, Posada suddenly took a
three-step rush toward second and stopped, and Ortiz drew up his
hands in front of his face as if he were going to start his
delivery. But he paused to wipe his forehead with his glove, and
Cooper and two other umpires pointed at him and screamed, ``Balk.''
Posada raised both hands in celebration as all the runners advanced
one base; Justice's run gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored a run in the fifth, but Clemens held that
lead, aided by Justice's sliding catch in the sixth inning with a
runner at second.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens retired the first two batters in the seventh, and when
the pinch-hitter Tim Salmon singled, Torre chose to replace him
with the left-hander Mike Stanton, who promptly picked off the
pinch-runner Benji Gil at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was waiting for Stanton at the top step of the dugout,
hand extended. Clemens's final line: four hits and three walks
allowed in six and two-thirds innings, and just one run. He has not
been charged with a loss since June 9 and has won six straight
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice keyed a Yankee rally in the eighth, somehow recovering
after he had been fooled by the breaking ball of the left-hander
Mike Holtz to pull a single to right field. Williams moved to third
on that hit and scored when Tino Martinez singled.

CLINTONS JOIN L.A. JEWISH GROUPS IN PRAISING LIEBERMAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CULVER CITY, Calif. _ About 3,000 Jewish leaders and activists
joined President Clinton and the first lady Sunday in celebrating
the history-making candidacy of Sen. Joe Lieberman for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the gala on the Main Street set at Sony Pictures
Studios praised Vice President Al Gore's choice of the Orthodox
Jewish senator from Connecticut as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   It was the nomination that had brought such a large crowd to the
event and ignited their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Morgan, chairman of the Jewish Federation, stood at the
podium and ripped up the speech he wrote last Sunday to focus on
the dramatic turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we can look at the faces of our children
and our children and our grandchildren and say, you, too, could be
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton _ appearing in part as
her party's Senate candidate from New York _ were the star speakers
at the event hosted by the America Israel Public Affairs Council,
United Jewish Communities, the National Jewish Democratic Council
and the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reflected on meeting Lieberman 30 years ago,
when he and Hillary Rodham were law students and Lieberman was a
28-year-old candidate for Connecticut state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was very impressed that Lieberman had been a
Freedom Rider in the South, registering African-American voters.
The Clintons have kept in close touch since.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brilliant man, a little bit of an iconoclast, always
thinking new thoughts, and I think we need more of that in
politics,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady echoed many speakers before her when she
encouraged the crowd to make the most of the historic decision by
campaigning for Gore and other Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us can be deterred in any way from
talking to anyone we can about why we're such strong supporters of
the Democratic Party,'' she said. ``For all of us who care about
this election and who care about this extraordinary ticket of Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman, we need to speak with one clear voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also talked of his foreign policy efforts,
particularly in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't sugar-coat it,'' he said. ``I wanted an agreement and
we didn't get one. But significant progress was made at Camp
David.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that at last month's talks subjects were open to
discussion that no one ever dared broach before.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition, agreements require compromise,'' he said,
``which means no one gets 100 percent and neither side is in the
position to say it has completely vanquished the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may or may not get an agreement, but we ought to keep
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were warmly received during their speeches and
afterward, when they worked the crowd, which included several
senators, congressmen and candidates from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was in Washington, D.C, and did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, Clinton's Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, told the crowd he had attended a convention party for
Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were relishing your joy because it means if we can do it
with a Jewish-American, we can do it with an Italian-American, an
African- American, a Latino-American.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, said in an interview
that aside from his personal pride in Lieberman's nomination, he
believes he will be good for Gore in terms of votes. He said
Lieberman is not only Gore's choice, but the choice of the
political experts in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dispassionate, they are calculating, they are
spending tens of thousands of dollars each week to learn what the
country thinks, and they did not pick Joe Lieberman because they
thought he would cost them votes,'' Sherman said.

ERVIN FIRST BLACK TO QUALIFY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INDIANAPOLIS  &UR; _ &LR;  This was Sabir Muhammad's second go-around
trying to become the first swimmer of African-American heritage to
make a U.S. Olympic team. By contrast, Hart High product Anthony
Ervin is so new to the national scene, many people weren't even
aware he was an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows now.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials Sunday, Ervin literally beat
Muhammad across the color barrier, placing fifth  &UR; _ &LR;  three places
ahead of Muhammad  &UR; _ &LR;  in the 100-meter freestyle to earn a berth in
next month's Sydney Games as the first alternate on the 400-meter
freestyle relay, provided there are enough multievent qualifiers,
which hasn't been an issue in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, 19, lowered his personal best for the third time in as
many swims at the IUPUI Natatorium, clocking 49.29 seconds. Neil
Walker (48.71) and Ervin's training mate, Gary Hall Jr. (48.84),
secured the individual Olympic berths in the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it that much that I am of African-American
descent,'' said Ervin, whose father, Jack, is 75 percent
African-American and 25 percent Native American. His mother,
Sherry, is white.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, a sophomore-to-be at California, seemed less than
comfortable with the distinction he earned along with his
provisional  &UR; _ &LR;  at this point  &UR; _ &LR;  trip to Sydney. ``I don't look at
it that much that I am of African-American descent,'' Ervin said.
``I look like a white person. I thought about (the historical
implications), yeah. But like I said, I'm not really black. It's
hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he identifies his race on applications and surveys and
such, Ervin smiled and said, ``I check off a bunch (of boxes).''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, who won NCAA titles in the 50 and 100 freestyles this
past spring, wouldn't have been put on the spot about his heritage
 &UR; _ &LR;  a situation that was awkward for everybody concerned  &UR; _ &LR;  if
swimming in this country didn't have a tradition of having less
hues than the different blues in pool water.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin understood what all the fuss was about. He just never
looked at himself as being fast enough to be a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I was thinking if Sabir makes it, he'll be the first
African-American,'' said Ervin, who will compete in the 50
freestyle over the next two days. The one-lap sprint is his best
event; he is ranked seventh in the world and second in the U.S.
behind Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In other events, Lenny Krayzelburg of Trojan Swim Club and Aaron
Peirsol of Irvine Novaquatics set the stage for a fantastic final
tonight in the 200 backstroke. Peirsol, swimming in the first
semifinal in the event, set an Olympic Trials record of 1:57.93.
Krayzelburg clocked a 1:58.10 to win the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I think Lenny and I are toying with each other,''
Peirsol, 17, said. ``It's going to take a fast time to make the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, 24, who owns the world record of 1:55.87, was more
succinct: ``We could possibly see a world record. I would not be
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Quance-Julian couldn't say she was surprised she came
up short in her third and final shot at making a second Olympic
team. After finishing eighth in the 400 individual medley and
failing to qualify for the 200 IM finals, the Granada Hills High
product was realistic going into the 200 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   She qualified sixth for the final and finished fifth, then
shrugged as if to say, What's the wife and mother of an
18-month-old to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' she said. ``I'm so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice cracking, she added, ``It's hard. When you want
something so bad and sacrifice so much, not just me but my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't in the proper frame of mind, she said, to make a
decision about whether or not Sunday's race was the final one of
her decorated career. ``One part of me feels like I don't want my
career to end like this, feeling bitter and resentful,'' she said.
``But I'm 25 and I have a family. I can't put their lives on hold
forever.''

COWBOYS RESERVES BLOW ANOTHER LEAD IN LOSS TO OAKLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Evaluate this: Oakland 21, Cowboys 20, Sunday
night at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' preseason philosophy is to use exhibition games to
evaluate backup players, although first-year coach Dave Campo
readily admitted, ``I'm disappointed that we lost the game ...
(but) positively, it's the third straight game that our No. 1s left
with the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, the Cowboys' backups blew a
halftime lead. This time, it was a 14-point spread that evaporated
on them against a Raiders team, now 1-1, that pulled it out with
Bobby Hoying and Scott Dreisbach at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys fell to 0-3. They're 1-12 in preseason games during
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman and the No. 1 offense scored on three of five
possessions, while the Cowboys' first-team defense held the Raiders
to a 47-yard field goal by rookie Sebastian Janikowski in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final two minutes of the game, the Cowboys' second-
and third-team defense allowed Dreisbach and the Raiders to drive
39 yards in three plays, with tight end Willy Tate catching a
15-yard touchdown pass to pull the visitors within one point of the
lead, 20-19, 1:08 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The real hero in this game was Jon Gruden, the Raiders'
third-year head coach who _ fully understanding the importance of
preseason games _ went for the 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden was rewarded when Dreisbach threaded a bullet pass into
David Dunn, standing tall in the middle of the end zone and giving
the Raiders what held up to be a 21-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This was a 3 hour, 20-minute game that started slowly ... then
dragged to a near-halt. The first half lasted 1:41.
</P>
<P>
   The evening marked an early exit for Rocket Ismail (sprained
left thumb/no receptions) and followed an eerie, 10-minute delay
while an ambulance drove directly onto the Texas Stadium carpet and
took Oakland receiver Terry Mickens to a local hospital for spinal
observation (consciousness/feelings in extremities).
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders finished with 11 penalties for 98 yards. The Cowboys
had nine penalties for 59 yards, including two presnap penalties by
the offense and one by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some things we have to clean up, obviously,'' said
Campo, referring to the presnap flags.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this game was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to rookie kicker Tim Seder lining up and trying a
58-yard field goal that would have won the game. It fell short.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, there was a made-for-ESPN
``SportsCenter'', double-fumble play that began with a 58-yard bomb
from Cowboys' third-team quarterback Clint Stoerner to James
McKnight, who was seeing his first game action since 1998 with the
Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   This nuttiest play of the night went from Stoerner to McKnight,
who fumbled when stripped by Raiders safety Johnnie Harris at the
Oakland 7. Raiders safety Brandon Jennings scooped up the ball at
the Oakland 2 and returned it 48 yards to midfield where Cowboys
receiver-on-the-bubble Chris Brazzell chased him down and swatted
the ball into the turf. The ball then took a Sunday hop directly
into the hands of Cowboys rookie free agent Troy Hambrick, who
returned it the other way 25 yards to the Oakland 25.
</P>
<P>
   The play went for a Cowboys net gain of 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   This was also a game filled with deception. Aikman and the
first-team offense played all but the Cowboys' final series of the
first half and scored its second and third touchdowns (along with
its third field goal) of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and the first offense was in on five possessions but on
the field for only 7:54.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed 6 of 14 passes for 61 yards, with no
interceptions and no sacks. Yet 10 of the 17 points scored by the
Cowboys' first-team offense resulted in two drives totaling minus-1
yard.
</P>
<P>
   On their opening drive, the Cowboys lost three yards in three
plays before Seder nailed a 47-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.
Seder is 3-for-4 (48, 28 and 47 yards) against three different
teams over two continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's any more clear now than before,'' Campo
said of the kicking competition between rookies Seder and Rian
Lindell, who remains perfect this preseason by adding a 19-yard
field goal Sunday night. ``There is just going to have to be a
decision made at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys opened a 17-3 lead with 3:25 to play in the first
half when the first-team offense went 4 yards in five plays. Rookie
Michael Wiley scored from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   This was set up by another wild play in which Cowboys free-agent
cornerback Stephen Fisher returned his first of two interceptions
of the game for 62 yards to the Oakland 4, where he was caught from
behind as he began to raise his hand in premature celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders came back with a 9-yard touchdown scramble by Hoying
and a 44-yard field goal by Janikowski. Lindell allowed the Cowboys
to extend their lead to 20-13 before Dreisbach led the Raiders'
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Cowboys were glad to get some plays on video tape
to study.
</P>
<P>
   They could go home feeling positive about something. After all,
it's only preseason. nn

ATLER'S PATH TO TRIALS DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
 GYMNASTICS-ATLER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All this free time, like it or not . . . six weeks with too
little to do and too much to think about.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dangerous combination for Vanessa Atler. The year 2000,
an Olympic year, was about to take over the calendar, and here she
was, stuck in a strange new home in Plano, Texas, two time zones
removed from her roots in Canyon Country, Calif., with nothing on
her agenda but pondering the mess she was in.
</P>
<P>
   Her nature was to internalize things. Sure, she had set up a
personal Internet Web site (www.atler.com) almost four years ago
when, at 14, she had burst upon the national gymnastics scene as
the US junior champion, and she had taken pains not to make it a
routine, gee-whiz diary. So she had shared some of her most private
thoughts, good and bad, with the nearly 1 million correspondents
who had visited the site. But there were some things that were off
limits, some things not even she was sure about, like whether it
was worth the aggravation to pursue her career through the US
Olympic team trials at Boston's FleetCenter Thursday-Sunday, and,
ideally, on to her ultimate destination, the Sydney Games next
month.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't quite how she had envisioned the final all-out
preparations to secure her passport to Australia. It seemed there
were nothing but negatives to dwell upon; the only problem was
where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. She need look no further than her useless left ankle,
encased in a cast, veteran of two operations _ the first one two
months ago in October 1999, the second a month later _ to remove
crippling bone chips that had helped ruin her year. This was a
frightening predicament, her first serious injury, and she didn't
know quite how to handle it. She'd been hurt before _ broken
fingers and wrists, the inevitable souvenirs of relentless
gymnastics punishment _ but she'd always been able to work through
them. Not this. She was under strict orders to engage in nothing
more than light duty through the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't been away from the beam and the bars and the vault
for so long since she was 5 1/2 years old and revealed her dream
ambition to her mother: to become a cheerleader and date a football
player. Her mother, Nanette, taught tennis, and Vanessa had tried
it briefly. But she was too short both in height _ she was only 4
feet 10 inches _ and desire, and soon she had abandoned the sport
in frustration. So Mom had put her in tumbling class, and Vanessa
quickly discovered two things: She loved it and she was good at it.
Goodbye, pompoms and quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   She began competing at 8, rode the express elevator to the elite
level at 12 . . . And now wondered whether it was time to get off.
There was a particular urgency attached to her training, with the
Olympics so close, and she was woefully rusty and out of shape. All
she could do in the gym was a little casual work on the uneven
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, another obstacle. Those blasted bars. They were one of the
four elements in women's gymnastics _ along with floor exercise,
vault, and balance beam _ known in the parlance as ``skills.'' Such
a cruel misnomer for Atler. She was anything but skilled on the
bars _ at least while performing the routine devised by Steve
Rybacki and Beth Kline-Rybacki, her coaches since she'd signed up
at their Gliders Gymnasium in Covina, Calif., at age 11. They'd
developed her into prominence but also installed an intricate
release on the bars, a move called the Comaneci, that was
sabotaging her career. She could do it in practice and probably
could have done it in competition, but there seemed to be a
psychological barrier she could not cross in front of judges and an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   She had fallen while attempting it in three straight nationals,
and the gaffe had cost her sole possession of the all-around title
in 1997 and even a piece of it in '98 and '99. Everything else
about her performance was virtually flawless _ she'd been a
national champion in the floor, vault, and beam at one time or
another _ but in terms of overall eminence, the Comaneci was her
downfall, and she seemed permanently in the shadow of her good
friend and major rival, Kristen Maloney. That was another stumbling
block, but the Comaneci was the real villain. Atler once had told
reporters that she insisted on keeping the move, but the truth was,
she now acknowledged, that the Rybackis wanted it to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effect of the chips and the Comaneci had just
about kidnapped her confidence, made her afraid in competition,
left her at such an emotional ebb that she constantly worried about
Maloney and the other girls instead of concentrating on her
routine.
</P>
<P>
   She divulged none of this until it became unbearable. And then
she dropped a bombshell on her parents and coaches. Instead of
taking an intermediate detour _ say, insisting that the Comaneci be
scrapped _ she decided on a complete break. She wanted to leave the
Rybackis, leave California, and move to Plano, home of World
Olympic Gymnastics and its proprietor, Valeri Liukin, who had won
gold in the high bars and silver in the men's all-around at the
1988 Olympics in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Liukin was pretty much a neophyte coach, never having handled a
star of Atler's magnitude, but Atler long had admired the Russian
gymnastics approach, and this son of the former Soviet Union
embodied it. Still, her decision shocked the Rybackis and her
parents, Nanette and Ted, an electronics technician for the US
Postal Service. But she'd talked things out with them all. She
parted on good terms with the Rybackis and received wholehearted
support from her family; Nanette moved with her to Plano while Ted
and her older brother, Teddy, remained in Canyon Country.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question she needed to do something; the crap shoot
was whether this was it. No less a figure than Olympic team
coordinator Bela Karolyi had recognized her talent and angst and
lethargy. The outsized Romanian mentor/maestro's opinion was
considered gospel. Not only was he the de facto US coach, but he
also had spun Olympic gold out of Nadia Comaneci _ inspiration for
that cursed release move that now haunted Atler _and later Mary Lou
Retton. Karolyi believed she was on the verge of quitting, and ``to
lose a quality athlete like Vanessa,'' he said, ``would be the
biggest shame in the whole world.'' So he told her parents, ``Don't
give up. Don't give up! Make the necessary move if you have to, but
stay in the sport because it's a beautiful thing and there's
(little time) to go and you can fulfill all the dreams that you've
been nurturing around (Vanessa's) athletic performance and athletic
career. So do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So they did it. And Liukin welcomed her. More than that, he
realized that, on the cusp of 18, she was no longer a little girl
but a young woman, someone to be listened to instead of lectured.
He intuitively knew that the Comaneci was history, but for good
measure, Atler told him she wasn't going to do it anymore. Problem
was, she wasn't in condition to do much of anything now. Physically
or mentally. Virtually on the eve of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Happy new year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darn if it hasn't been a happy year. It may end up being
euphoric. The Olympic trials are here, and the old Atler is back,
assured and proficient, almost a guarantee to go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that hiatus was the elixir she needed. Rather than
reinforcing her doubts, it rejuvenated her. By the time she went to
Houston for the US Olympic Committee Media Summit in May, the
bounce was back in her step and her voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it was almost a blessing in disguise,'' she said. ``I
started missing (gymnastics) a lot more and loved it again.
Sometimes you're doing it so much, you forget why you're doing it.
When I had to stop for a while, it gave me a lot more motivation _
wanting to do it again and learning new tricks and getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The ankle obliged, too. It's always going to hurt, Atler
understands, but she can live with that nuisance and it's no longer
an issue in competition.
</P>
<P>
   And she's buried the Comaneci and streamlined her bars routine
under Liukin's tutelage. ``It was a big chance,'' he said of the
Comaneci. ``You don't want to take a chance at this level. (So) it
was just a matter of getting comfortable technique-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   She's more than that. She's positively refreshed on the bars.
``I just knew that that's what I needed,'' Atler said. ``We changed
a whole bunch, so it wasn't like there's a little bit of that (old)
bar routine in my mind. It was just all like a clean slate, and
it's almost like a new event for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is more delighted than Karolyi, who launched into one of
his stream-of-consciousness metaphors, replete with elaborate
pantomime, to illustrate his emotional ride since Atler reached the
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was breaking,'' he said, ``because I knew it was like
the gold miner. You dig and dig and dig and dig and dig (each
``dig'' accompanied by a vigorous shoveling motion). Fine. (Now
holding an imaginary nugget) `Oh my God, it's a big one.'
(Mimicking the trauma of watching the prize vanish) Then the gold
starts melting in your hand; your heart is breaking. Or you've
dropped it and the water is taking it away. Golly, it is breaking
your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation is what I was feeling. But I was very, very
glad she find her place and find her reason'' to continue.
</P>
<P>
   All she had to do first was agonize over her reasons not to.

RUIZ EFFORT DEFUSED BY REFEREE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ John Ruiz's downfall was that he came to fight
Saturday night and Richard Steele came to watch.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the wise choice for Ruiz, but not for Steele, who
is supposed to be a law enforcement officer in the ring. Ruiz is
paid to fight, and when you're in with Evander Holyfield, it is the
required thing to do. Steele is paid to enforce the rules that
exist between two people engaged in the most primitive of sports,
and when you're a referee in with Holyfield, it's the required
thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz did his job. Steele did not. And so, at some point during
Saturday night's fight for the World Boxing Association heavyweight
title at the Paris Hilton, the bout slipped from boxing into
brawling and with it went Ruiz's chance to become the first
Hispanic heavyweight champion in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny has the heart of a lion and it overcame him,'' said
trainer Gabe Mari after his fighter lost a razor-thin, 12-round
unanimous decision to Holyfield on a night when many people,
including the Showtime broadcast crew and its online viewers poll,
felt Ruiz won handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan was to punch and move. He didn't do it. He did it
some, but in a lot of rounds he wanted to fight the guy. Holyfield
made it a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   That had been Mari's fear entering the match, that his young
boxer would be lured into fighting Holyfield's fight, which is more
warfare than art. He feared Ruiz would find the aging and slowed
Holyfield so easy to hit that he would get swept up in the moment
and forget to punch and move. In the end he did, although Mari and
many others still believe Ruiz was a big winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it twice,'' said former HBO vice president of boxing
programming Lou DiBella, who never has been a Ruiz fan. ``I taped
it and watched it again after I heard the decision. That decision
was an abomination. I thought it was an atrocity. There is no way
Holyfield won. None. Zero. That was a bad, bad, corrupt decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime commentator and former light heavyweight champion Bobby
Czyz had Ruiz leading, 5-1, after six rounds and ended up scoring
the bout 9-3 for Ruiz. After the match, he ripped the decision, as
did fellow broadcaster Steve Albert. Longtime promoters Cedric
Kushner and Mike Acri also had Ruiz winning easily after they
watched at home.
</P>
<P>
   But in Las Vegas, judges Duane Ford and Dave Moretti scored the
bout 114-113 for Holyfield, even giving him a 10-8 round in the
third without benefit of a knockdown because he got Ruiz in big
trouble with 25 seconds left after doing nothing special but
picking up the pace before that. The third judge, Fernando Viso,
obviously filled in his card before the fight, scoring it 116-112
for Holyfield. The Globe card had it even after 11 rounds and gave
the last to Holyfield to make it 114-113 for the now four-time
heavyweight champion. What a scorecard that close means is that it
could have gone either way and many obviously felt it went in the
wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy was swirling at the postfight press conference with
promoter Don King stirring the pot by calling for an immediate
rematch, something that could only happen if Ruiz is left as the
No. 1 contender by the WBA despite the defeat. Otherwise, Holyfield
would be mandated to fight Wladimir Klitschko (ranked third) next
unless King can force a bout between Klitschko and Ruiz as a
box-off for a shot at the new WBA champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain people think Johnny won, so let's do it again,'' King
said, and Ruiz didn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was close,'' Ruiz said. ``I hope a rematch
comes to put all these doubts aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Those doubts certainly would have been dispelled had Ruiz fought
the entire night the way he fought the first two rounds when he
followed his battle plan brilliantly and won both with stinging
body shots and a jab that slammed often into Holyfield's face.
Seldom did Ruiz get hit. He would punch his way inside, then tie up
Holyfield before any damage could be done by Holyfield's fists,
elbows, head, shoulders, or the laces of his gloves.
</P>
<P>
   There was little Steele had to do up to that point and he did it
well. But after Holyfield landed a big right hand down the pipe
that buckled Ruiz's knees and had him in deep trouble with 25
seconds left in the third round, everything seemed to change.
Wobbling badly, Ruiz held on, wrestling with Holyfield along the
ropes, clutching him like a man holding a lamppost in a stiff
January snowstorm until the wind dies down. As he did, Steele
watched, not moving in to break the two, which would have put Ruiz
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the storm let up, and the round ended with a sagging
Ruiz still holding Holyfield tightly before he returned to his
corner. When he came back out, he was ready to fight, not box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny had taken Holyfield's best,'' Mari said. ``Then the
fighter's heart took over his game plan. Without Johnny, there
would have been no fight. Johnny Ruiz made the fight after that. He
was the one pressing Holyfield, but the referee didn't do his job.
I'm not going to cry about the referee because we knew it before
the fight. He didn't do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ruiz and his cornermen felt Steele didn't do was stop
Holyfield from slamming an elbow into Ruiz's face repeatedly. One
of the blows broke Ruiz's nose in the 10th and another bloodied it
in the 12th, they said. Ruiz even stepped back in that last round
to complain, a complaint that fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did Steele do anything but warn Holyfield against using
his head on Ruiz's face, the same charge Mike Tyson and Lennox
Lewis made against him. It was ignored on those nights and ignored
again Saturday night, according to Ruiz and his manager, Norman
Stone. Ignored even after Stone asked Steele to be aware of
Holyfield's borderline reading of the Marquis of Queensbury's
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's a rules guy,'' Stone said of Holyfield. ``He's
not a rules guy. I told Steele in the dressing room that I wanted
him to watch two things _ heads and elbows. He said he'd take full
control. He didn't do flip. If he did his job, John is heavyweight
champion of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ruiz left the ring with a loss, a broken nose, dark
bruises around both eyes, and scrapes and scratches all over,
including the back of his neck and shoulders. Some came from
Holyfield punches. But not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked Steele to control the fight, but he let Holyfield do
what he does,'' a bitter Ruiz (36-4) said. ``I was happy Holyfield
came to fight, but the referee didn't control the fight. Never once
did I (think) I'd lose. I still feel I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield (37-4-1) was quiet as this talk went on, sitting near
Ruiz at a podium and saying only: ``On nights when things didn't go
my way, I didn't cry. I didn't grumble. I did what I had to do. I
went back out and won more fights. He was a very aggressive
fighter. I never knew if he'd run over me or not. He didn't fight
the way I thought he would. I couldn't catch him with the right
hand but once.
</P>
<P>
   ``He earned a lot of respect. I knew I couldn't just run over
him. He didn't give me room to do anything. You don't have to be
hurt to learn to respect a guy. I was just a little bit better. Not
a lot. Just a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a matter of opinion that was in much dispute by the end
of the night. Ringside observers did not seem to have much of a
quarrel with the outcome, but TV viewers clearly did and so did
Showtime's broadcasting team and a wide assortment of veteran
boxing observers not at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander was a lucky guy tonight,'' said Jay Larkin, the cable
network's programming executive and a longtime friend of Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Luck? Corruption? Bad refereeing? In the end, none of that
mattered to Ruiz, the kid from Chelsea, Mass., who made clear that
he belonged in the ring with the top heavyweights in the world
regardless of what anyone had said about him before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   He won his point and he convinced many he won the fight.
Unfortunately, he didn't convince three guys with pencils or a
referee with a hands-off policy, but he convinced the most
important guy. He convinced himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great show,'' Ruiz said through his disappointment.
``I came to fight. Holyfield came to fight. I felt like I won, but
you've got to leave it to the judges sometimes. That's life. But I
still say that belt would look better around my waist than his.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Richard Steele done his job as well as John Ruiz did, it
might have.

CLEMENS TOO MUCH FOR ANGELS, ORTIZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Anaheim Angels handled Pedro Martinez, and ``El
Duque,'' and even Denny Neagle during their recent run, but Roger
Clemens . . . well, that was a little too much, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and relievers Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera limited
the heavy-hitting Angels to just four hits Sunday night, and the
New York Yankees emerged with a 4-1 win before 43,411 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   It snapped the Angels' winning streak at three games, took a
little of the luster off what was otherwise a splendid homestand,
and brought young Ramon Ortiz back to earth after his two-hitter
last week against Boston and the redoubtable Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, the Angels manager, looked at Ortiz's performance
two ways: good and not so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us seven innings and he allowed only two runs,''
Scioscia said. ``We win that game a lot of nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was also too hyper, too anxious. He didn't have the
same mound presence he did against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz walked home one run in the second inning and balked in
another in the fourth when he absentmindedly rubbed his nose as he
started his delivery with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even realize I did it,'' Ortiz (4-3) said through
interpreter Juan Alvarez. ``It was just sweat coming down and I was
wiping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (10-6) won his sixth consecutive decision, coming just
two days after signing a three-year, $3.9 million contract
extension. He gave up four hits, walked three and struck out two.
He retired 10 Angels in a row during one stretch, finally yielding
a run in the fifth on a two-out RBI single by Darin Erstad, making
it a 2-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens came out after Tim Salmon's pinch single with two outs
in the seventh. Stanton took over and got out of the inning without
even throwing a pitch; he picked pinch-runner Benji Gil off first.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton got the first out in the eighth, then Rivera took over
and retired the last five batters for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz gave up just two runs on three hits in seven innings,
striking out five. But he also walked six.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main difference (from his win over Boston) was I wasn't
consistent with my fastball in the strike zone,'' he said. ``I was
all over the place. I wasn't anxious (as Scioscia suggested), I was
trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, one more thing: Clemens' next start will be Friday night at
Yankee Stadium . . . against the Angels.

THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS TAKE TO L.A. STREETS   WITHOUT VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO, BRENT HOPKINS and HEATHER MaCDONALD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About 4,000 protesters peacefully marched from
Pershing Square to Staples Center on Sunday under the watchful eye
of a beefed-up Los Angeles Police Department force, setting a
positive tone to coming days of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The event Sunday was the first of many major protests scheduled
to coincide with the Democratic National Convention, which starts
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the International Action Center, the protest
centered on demands for a new trial for Death Row prisoner Mumia
Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of murdering a police officer in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no injuries, just one arrest for vandalism, and
no other incidents at the event, which started at noon in Pershing
Square and ended with a rally in front of Staples Center at 4 p.m.
Protesters even cleaned up trash left behind at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our hope that the rest of the week will continue as
peacefully as today, but of course we're prepared for the worst if
necessary,'' said Officer Jason Lee, a LAPD spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of uniformed police officers on motorcycles and
bicycles in packs of about 50 zig-zagged through alleys and back
streets along the protest route, setting up defense lines on side
streets and maintaining a low-key presence.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan was encouraged by the first protest events
surrounding the convention, which runs through Thursday, said Peter
Hidalgo, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was briefed by Chief (Bernard) Parks throughout the
day, and the demonstrations that have taken place were clearly
thousands of people expressing their First Amendment rights
peacefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A wide array of civil rights activists nationwide have
criticized Abu-Jamal's murder conviction. They maintain the former
Black Panther and radio journalist did not get a fair trial. He was
sentenced to death in 1982 for killing Philadelphia police Officer
Daniel Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   The protest included well-known figures such as civil-rights
activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson, actor Ed Asner, union leader
Dolores Huerta and ACLU President Leonard Weinglass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, as a nation, become too desensitized to organized
killing,'' Weinglass said.
</P>
<P>
   Asner added: ``This is a God-fearing country where we swear on
the Bible to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth. But when it comes to killing, we tell God to mind his own
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urged protesters to continue their struggle until
Abu-Jamal receives a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must make killing people illegal in this country,'' Jackson
said. ``We must march until they stop the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters came from out of town, and said they were
apprehensive of coming because of the zero-tolerance stance the
LAPD has taken on DNC-related protests.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the businesses along the march route closed Sunday, but
others stayed open along the Broadway business corridor, which is
normally a flurry of mostly Latino commercial activity ranging from
swap meets to jewelry shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops and the television media worked up a big scare for
the local merchants, making us sound like a bunch of criminals,''
said Carl Russo, a San Francisco cab driver who came down with a
bus caravan for the protest. ``The reality is that we're here to
express ourselves and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Sgt. Robert Hauck said police were focused on keeping the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working with the organizations,'' Hauck said,
referring to the protesters. ``They want this to be the same thing
we do, a peaceful demonstration. That's not a lot of rhetoric, it's
really what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles resident Cristina Suarez, 17, was one of many
marchers who wore a black bandanna emblazoned with ``Free Mumia''
around her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way to remain anonymous,'' said Suarez, dressed in a
patchwork American Flag dress. ``I'm here representing oppressed
people everywhere. It doesn't matter who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The march featured large, colorful puppets, including a 15-foot
``corporate greed'' figure that held a hypodermic needle injecting
a dose of the ``death penalty'' into ``universal healthcare.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were able to rally adjacent to Staples Center
thanks to a recent court decision that overturned an LAPD plan to
limit protests to several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Democratic delegates from around the country who
streamed on foot from their downtown hotels to take an early look
at Staples Center also got a close look at the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it might be dangerous, but I think it turned out
great that everything was peaceful,'' said Mark Miles, a Missouri
delegate. ``Heck, when I was in school back in '67, I was out there
protesting, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of unruly activity was a small contingent of about
a dozen anarchists who burned the American flag and taunted police
officers along the march route, but there was no violence.

COWBOYS ESCAPE WITH MINOR INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If the NFL cast a ballot of those who want fewer
preseason games, receiver Rocket Ismail and fullback Robert Thomas
might vote yes. So might the Dallas Cowboys after bothincurred
minor injuries in Sunday night's 21-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail suffered a sprained left thumb attempting to catch a Troy
Aikman pass in the end zone on the Cowboys' first offensive play
midway through the first quarter. He was taken to the locker room
for X-rays, which were negative. He did not play the rest of the
game but did return to the sidelines in the second quarter with his
left hand heavily wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas sprained his left knee when he collided with two Raiders
defenders on running back Michael Wiley's 1-yard touchdown run with
3:25 left in the first half. Thomas hobbled off the field and did
not return.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie cornerback Mario Edwards suffered a strained left
hamstring in the first half and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not had a chance to talk to the trainers, but the only
thing I heard just on the field was they didn't feel too bad about
it,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``So, in all three cases, I
don't know for sure, but I feel comfortable with it right now.''
OUT OF THE FRAY
</P>
<P>
   Several key starters and reserves did not play because of minor
injuries. The notables were running back Emmitt Smith (strained
calf), guard Larry Allen (precautionary-fractured hand), center
Mark Stepnoski (flu), receiver Jason Tucker (groin), tight end
David LaFleur (strained groin) and quarterback Randall Cunningham
(coach's decision). STOERNER FAIRS WELL
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free agent Clint Stoerner was the backup quarterback
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced Aikman with less than two minutes remaining in the
first half and played until Paul Justin relieved him in the fourth
quarter. Stoerner completed 8 of 12 passes for 108 yards and led
the Cowboys to a fourth-quarter field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's easier, but everything slows down a little
bit,'' Stoerner said. ``I am further along than I thought I'd be
simply because I've got more playing time than I thought I'd get.''
</P>
<P>
   He had back luck on a third-quarter interception when a pass
into the end zone popped out of the hands of receiver Damon Hodge
to Johnnie Harris of the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not his fault,'' Dave Campo said. ``He did a good job
of finding the receiver, he was open in the end zone; we just
didn't make the play.'' RAIDER GETS A SCARE
</P>
<P>
   Raiders receiver Terry Mickens was conscious and had feeling in
his lower extremities after being taken off the field in an
ambulance in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After catching a short pass at the 36-yard line, Mickens was
spun down by Dexter Coakley and appeared to be hit on the top of
the helmet by George Teague's lower right side.
</P>
<P>
   Mickens lay motionless for 10 minutes with a sprained neck. He
was put on a stretcher and driven to a local hospital for
observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it scared me,'' Coakley said. ``I wrapped my hands
around him and I didn't know it happened.'' NOBLE EFFORT
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Brandon Noble is listed at 6-foot-2, but
Raiders rookie place-kicker Sebastian Janikowski found Noble's
reach is considerably higher.
</P>
<P>
   On a 57-yard field goal attempt late in the first quarter, Noble
tipped Janikowski's attempt and the ball landed well short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a longer kick so he kicked it low. (Defensive end)
Michael Myers and I got a real good push and it just hit me,'' said
Noble, who deflected a pass later in the game. ``I should have
caught it. It hit me right in the hands.'' LETT REVISTED
</P>
<P>
   Shades of the Leon Lett's 1992 Super Bowl performance were on
display when cornerback Stephen Fisher intercepted Bobby Hoying's
pass at the Cowboys' 34-yard line and was returning it for an
apparent first-half touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   When Fisher reached the Oakland 10, he raised his right hand to
celebrate only to have Oakland receiver Kenny Shedd tackle him from
behind at the 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to do that in the preseason than the regular
season,'' said Fisher, who added another interception in the
fourth-quarter. ``I was hot-doggin' it a little bit.'' nn

McKNIGHT, BRAZZELL IMPROVE CHANCES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Never mind that the Dallas Cowboys' first-team
offense managed 66 yards on five first-half possessions in Sunday
night's 21-20 loss to the Raiders, including six yards in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The game was mainly for players on the roster bubble and those
looking to define their roles with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The first cuts are set for Aug. 22, when the Cowboys roster will
be trimmed from 86 to 65. Considering that head coach Dave Campo
wants to focus on the front-line players and their key backups
Saturday against the Broncos, Sunday night's matchup offered the
last real chance for several players to make a good impression.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those players who got Campo's attention were receivers
James McKnight and Chris Brazzell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazzell did some positive things on special teams,'' Campo
said. ``And I'm real excited about James McKnight. He's everything
we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight caught four passes for 89 yards in his first action as
a Cowboy since being acquired from Seattle in a trade roughly 14
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in
training camp last year and missed the entire season. The Cowboys
have brought him back slowly, holding him out of the first two
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sunday night's performance was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to be back out there,'' McKnight said.
``I got knocked around a couple of times and made some plays. I'm
just going to stay humble and keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, who displayed his big-play ability with a 58-yard
reception, also showed that he might be the leading candidate for
the third-receiver spot. His chief competitors _ Wane McGarity
(inconsistent play) and Jason Tucker (strained right groin) _ have
been unable to take advantage of his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Brazzell is just trying to make the roster. His three catches
for 44 yards certainly helped his chances, and helped erase the
memories he left with coaches of dropped passes in the first two
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brazzell's chances are based largely on how he
contributes on special teams. He had a key tackle on a punt return
against the Raiders, and he also showed some difference-making
hustle when he chased down defensive back Brandon Jennings on a
fumble return and created a turnover for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who helped himself was rookie free-agent
quarterback Clint Stoerner. Because the Cowboys know what they have
in backup Randall Cunningham, and are unhappy with the play of Paul
Justin, Stoerner got an extended look.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner impressed Campo with his ability to scramble and make
things happen in a little more than a quarter of play. He completed
8 of 12 passes for 108 yards with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   On the interception, in the end zone, the ball bounced through
the hands of Cowboys receiver Damon Hodge and into the arms of
Raiders defensive back Johnnie Harris. nn

COWBOYS' ROOKIE LARRIMORE GETS PRAISE IN FIRST START
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ George Teague jolted the butterflies out of
rookie cornerback Kareem Larrimore's stomach in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this man right here,'' Larrimore said, motioning to
Teague dressing in the locker next to his, ``made that big hit, I
was comfortable the rest of the game. I was good to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague compiled a bone-crushing highlight reel Sunday night in
support of Larrimore, who made his first NFL start in Sunday
night's 21-20 exhibition loss to the Oakland Raiders at Texas
Stadium. Larrimore chuckled when he admitted his pregame
butterflies were a first in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie out of West Texas A&AMP;M took another step toward
becoming the Dallas Cowboys' starting left cornerback _ in the wake
of Kevin Smith's departure to mull retirement _ when the season
opens on Sept. 3. Sunday night he continued to show promise,
turning in a solid outing while playing nearly three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   His rookie jitters are being taken care of by veterans Teague
and Darren Woodson on and off the field, which Larrimore said is
allowing him to play worry-free football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel pressure, they ease it all out of me,'' Larrimore
said. ``They tell me to just have fun, that's what these games are
for. I thought I did fairly well. I probably made _ I don't want to
say mistakes _ I probably didn't go as far as I was supposed to on
some plays, but I feel I did fairly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore played opposite Ryan McNeil in the first quarter, the
duo that appears to headed for starting roles. With Deion Sanders
in Washington and Smith possibly not returning, Larrimore, a
fourth-round draft selection, has seized control of the position.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night things were relatively quiet on the left side. The
Raiders took few shots to his side, which Larrimore said _ half
winking _ made him feel a bit like Sanders. Through three quarters,
Larrimore and the rest of the Cowboys defense allowed 137 passing
yards on 14 of 27 passing from quarterbacks Rich Gannon and Bobby
Hoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done very well,'' Teague said. ``He has a few things to
touch up on, but we are very confident with where he is right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, second on the team with five tackles, played one down
in the fatal fourth quarter _ the Raiders' successful two-point
conversion to win the game _ when the Cowboys' reserves gave up 71
yards passing and the Raiders' game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I liked about him,'' Cowboys head coach Dave Campo
said, ``is he's being relatively aggressive, he's trying to make
things happen out there and that's an area we need him to be doing
out there and he's starting to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Larrimore's few gaffes came when Marcus Knight beat him
for a 30-yard completion from Gannon. However, a double penalty on
the Raiders negated the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident,'' Larrimore said. ``I didn't get many passes
my way, but come that first game, I know it will come.'' nn

SETBACKS DON'T HOLD BACK HALL 
</HEADLINE>
 SWIM TRIALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Deadhead phase is history. Gary Hall listens
to Bach these days. ``The Greatest Hits,'' he says. But he comes to
the starting line in a hooded black robe that he could have
borrowed from a medieval executioner, then strips down to Apollo
Creed-style star-spangled shorts and shadowboxes on the blocks. ``I
don't really think I'm a showman,'' Hall said. ``I just like to be
me.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing does not change, though. When he hears the starting
beep, Hall still makes sure he beats as many people as he needs to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled to have made it,'' Hall said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
after he came out of the competitive shadows at age 25 to finish
second behind Neil Walker in the 100-meter freestyle in the US
Olympic Swim Trials at the Indiana University Natatorium and earn a
return ticket to the Games in at least two events. ``I'm really
stoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was America's speed king four years ago, anchoring the 4 x
100 freestyle and medley relays to gold medals ahead of the
Russians and grabbing silver medals behind legendary Alexander
Popov in the 50 and 100.
</P>
<P>
   Then life intervened for the man from Paradise Valley, Ariz.
Hall was suspended for three months in 1998 for using marijuana and
lost his Speedo contract. Last year, he was diagnosed with
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was invincible before,'' said Hall. ``It was a
real shock. It gave me a taste of mortality. That can be a very
sobering experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time he turned up here for trials, he breezed onto the
team. This time, neither Hall nor anybody else knew what to expect.
He's seeded second in the 50, but the race is a crapshoot. In 1996,
world record-holder Tom Jager didn't make the team.
</P>
<P>
   So Hall's best shot was in the 100, even though he had only
raced the distance twice in the last two years before coming here
and was seeded fifth. ``When it comes down to a couple hundredths
of seconds to determine who gets to go to the Olympics and who
doesn't, there's always a possibility you might not make the
team,'' said Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But times never have mattered much to him. In the Olympics,
placement is all. And in the trials, second is as good as first.
When they got to the turn Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in a sizzling 22.71,
six-10ths of a second under Popov's world-record pace, Hall was
sitting second behind Walker.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 meters to go, though, Scott Tucker caught him and went
by. But Hall always has had a reserve tank in his purple microbus,
and he dipped into it deeply enough to touch out Tucker by
11-100ths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I touched, I thought about a song by the Clash: `I've
been beat up, I've been thrown out, but I'm not down,' '' said
Hall. ``That's me. You can't keep a good man down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even third place would have gotten Hall a relay spot. Misty
Hyman, who swims butterfly, didn't have that luxury. Four years
ago, she missed a spot on the team by one place. Last week, she
finished seventh in the 100 fly. Sundya &UR;  &LR; night was her last shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it so bad and there was no holding back,'' said the
21-year-old Hyman, who held on to win the 200 fly by 27-100ths of a
second (2:09.27) over 17-year-old Kaitlin Sandeno after leading the
field by two body-lengths halfway through. ``The elation hasn't set
in. It's mostly relief right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last shot, too, for 19-year-old Kyle Salyards, who
finished last in the 100 breaststroke final. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, he had
to come out of third place off the final turn to win the 200 breast
to touch out Tom Wilkens by 13-hundredths of a second in 2:13.21.
In a blanket finish, the top four were separated by only
32-hundredths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put everything I had into the last 50 _ and wow!'' said
Salyards, who was only eighth in the event at last year's summer
nationals.

HOLYFIELD JUDGED LACKING BY MANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ His boxer was up above him, up there on the dais of
a postfight press conference that is as much a fixture of the
fight-night ritual as the glitz and glamour of the crowd and the
closing bell. Up there, Evander Holyfield was smiling and saying,
time and again, ``I won't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Don Turner was sitting on a step of the podium. His head was
in his hands. ``Gloomy'' was the only word to describe the face of
Turner, Holyfield's trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Three times Holyfield had ducked questions about his strange
actions in the fourth round of Saturday night's World Boxing
Association title bout against John Ruiz of Chelsea, Mass. All
Holyfield would say was that Ruiz was a puzzle to him, that he
never was sure what Ruiz was going to do, that he never had a feel
for the ``rhythm'' of his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion, Holyfield had rocked Ruiz with several
hard rights in the final seconds of the third round. Even though
Ruiz's legs were wobbly, he had gained huge respect by surviving
the round.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, though, Holyfield would come out in the fourth and
attack Ruiz. Surely, Holyfield would try to put away Ruiz in the
opening seconds. Surely, Holyfield now had his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Holyfield did nothing. Instead, Holyfield was passive,
never showing any aggression. Instead, Holyfield not only failed to
put Ruiz away, but he also lost the round on the cards of all three
judges and virtually all observers at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Turner was asked. ``Why hadn't Holyfield gone for the
kill in the fourth round?''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's eyes briefly flashed. ``Maybe he didn't want to,'' he
replied. Then, Turner returned his face to his hands and the gloom
returned. That sight said so much more than hopeful words from
Holyfield up above Turner on the dais _ that he still wants to
continue on at the age of 37, that he still has the skills to take
on the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   There were more histrionics on Showtime about the outcome of the
bout, won by Holyfield by a unanimous _ but close _ decision. The
TV announcers felt Ruiz clearly won the bout, other observers at
ringside felt the bout was close, but most gave the nod to
Holyfield. A poll of media members at ringside had Holyfield
winning on 16 scorecards, Ruiz winning on five, and one observer
scoring the fight a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, virtually all felt this was not a good night for
Holyfield, the former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
All also came away with huge respect for Ruiz, whose sharp left
jab, whose constant stepping inside of Holyfield's punches, whose
coming at Holyfield with lowered head left Holyfield unsure of what
to do, how to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Styles make fights,'' Holyfield said time and again in
explaining his performance. And Ruiz's style had been confusing to
him. Holyfield called that style ``awkward.'' Others saw it as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing was that I couldn't get impatient,'' Holyfield
tried to explain, as if he had been fighting Lennox Lewis or Mike
Tyson, with their true heavyweight punches, instead of Ruiz, whose
main weapon was his jab. ``If I get impatient, then I put myself at
risk. This guy, he butted me in my nose, and he jumped at me with
his head, coming at me headfirst, and when his head hit me in my
body, it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 10th round had arrived, and Ruiz still was
standing, a surprise to many (``I came close to believing all you
people who said I could take this guy lightly''), Holyfield knew he
no longer could worry about Ruiz's style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that 10th round, I knew I had to hurt him,'' said
Holyfield. ``I knew I had to give him some shots.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Holyfield took the final rounds on the cards of all
judges, giving him the fight.
</P>
<P>
   He had survived a night with John Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite question had been posed entering the fight: Could
Ruiz survive a night with Holyfield?
</P>
<P>
   And the gloomy face of Don Turner said all that had to be said
about the future of Evander Holyfield.

   Bagwell, Alou bash Phils
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Astros showed off their version of the Bash
Brothers on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit two home runs and tied a club record with seven
RBIs, and Moises Alou also homered twice as the Astros flexed their
muscles in a 14-7 rout of the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Alou combined to go 7-for-11 with two home runs,
five runs and 10 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were locked in,'' Astros shortstop Tim Bogar said.
``Everybody was pretty confident at the plate. Not too many pitches
were missed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros matched a club record with six homers _ Richard
Hidalgo and Chris Truby also connected _ and collected a
season-high 19 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell went 4-for-5 and was hit by a pitch as he tied the club
record for RBIs shared by Rafael Ramirez (1989) and Pete Incaviglia
(1992).
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit a three-run homer in the fourth inning off Phillies
lefthander Omar Daal (3-13) as the Astros built a 9-5 lead and
added his 33rd homer in the eighth off Chris Brock. He also had a
pair of RBI singles and a run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a machine,'' Alou said. ``He's unbelievable. That's why
he needs to stay in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou wasn't too shabby, either. A day after being ejected in the
fourth inning for arguing balls and strikes in a 3-2 Astros loss,
the right fielder hit home runs No. 19 and 20. He had a two-run
homer in the first and a solo shot in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can just flat-out hit,'' said Bagwell, who extended
his hitting streak to a season-high 12 games. ``He's the best
hitter we've got. He's clutch. He comes up with big hit after big
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case up and down the Astros' lineup Sunday as every
starter except pitcher Brian Powell had at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo had one of his best offensive games of the season,
going 3-for-3 with two doubles and three runs. He also drew a pair
of walks.
</P>
<P>
   Bogar had a season-high three hits, including a triple, and
Truby chipped in two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that triple easy, but I had to get dirty, so I slowed
down so I could slide,'' said Bogar, who started all three games in
the series. ``It's hard to get dirty on turf.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the offensive explosion, it nearly wasn't enough as
the Astros watched a 5-0 first-inning lead almost evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Houston jumped on Daal for five runs and four hits in the first
inning, highlighted by home runs by Alou and Truby.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, who relied mostly on changeups and off-speed pitches,
surrendered 10 hits and nine runs in four innings. He is 0-6 with a
7.43 ERA in 22 career games against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Daal and Brock each gave up three homers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what we did is what we should do when you face
pitchers that aren't throwing well,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored two runs in the bottom of the first off
Powell on Bobby Abreu's RBI triple and Mike Lieberthal's RBI
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   After Bagwell drove in a run in the second inning with a
grounder to short, the Phillies closed the gap to 6-5 on a
three-run homer by Marlon Anderson. Powell was ahead 1-and-2 in the
count before serving up a fastball across the middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the pitches I wanted back,'' said Powell, who
lasted only 2 innings. ``I had him where I wanted, but I didn't
make the pitch at the crucial time. I felt like I did that my last
couple of times out. I made a pitch when I needed to make it, and
today I just didn't do it. I hate that I didn't contribute more.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who held the New York Mets to one run over seven innings
in his last start, allowed five runs on six hits during his
58-pitch outing. The righthander pleaded unsuccessfully with
Dierker before being replaced by Joe Slusarski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was one pitch away from righting the ship,'' Powell
said. ``I didn't want to come out of the game, but obviously he
made the right choice for the team, and the bullpen did an
excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's three-run homer in the fourth put the Astros ahead
9-5, but the Phillies rallied again in the bottom of the inning
when Rob Ducey hit an RBI double and eventually scored on a wild
pitch by Slusarski.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Astros relievers Jose Cabrera, Wayne Franklin
and Marc Valdes combined to hold the Phillies hitless over the
final five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera (1-2), who was making his first appearance since being
recalled from Class AAA New Orleans on Thursday, pitched two
innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who said he entered the game with a plan to sit back on
pitches and drive them to right-center field, hit a solo homer off
Brock to lead off the seventh, and Bagwell and Hidalgo connected
for back-to-back shots in the eighth. The home run barrage marked
the seventh time this season the Astros have hit four or more
homers in a game, including six on three different occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Of further significance, Hidalgo became only the fifth Astros
player to reach 30 home runs in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been struggling lately,'' said Hidalgo, who was in a
1-for-13 slump before his homer. ``I just need to relax and be more
confident. When you've got confidence, nobody can stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell credited his club-record-tying RBI performance to the
top of the order's consistently reaching base. Lugo and Bogar, who
batted 1-2 in the lineup, reached eight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in front of me did a tremendous job of getting on
base the whole game,'' said Bagwell, whose previous single-game
high was six RBIs. ``Every time I came up to the plate, there was
somebody on base. That makes it easy.''

<P>
   REVERE, Mass. _ For whatever reason, Billie Van, the 8-5 choice
in Saturday night's 66th running of the $100,000 Wonderland Derby,
hesitated at the break. Greys Free Bird, a noted closer, took full
advantage of the favorite's moment of indecision, and flew out of
the box in great position, a move that led to victory at 7-1
($16.60).
</P>
<P>
   A converted sprinter from Raynham, Billie Van had drawn the
coveted No. 1 box Thursday. The 67-pound black female had broken on
top in three of her four Derby preliminaries, breaking third in the
other, but she came out seventh in the final, despite the advantage
of the rail. Greys Free Bird, a 64-pound red brindle female who
usually does her best running late, popped out in second position
from box No. 2, behind speedy front-runner NR's Fast Eddie, who
zipped to the lead from box No. 4 at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   NR's Fast Eddie, who finished second as the favorite in last
year's Derby, opened a 2-length advantage, but Greys Free Bird was
too close too early for him to hold on. NR's Fast Eddie ran hard
all the way, but Greys Free Bird ran around him in midstretch, and
drew off to win by 2 lengths. The time for the Revere Course (2,045
feet) was 38.53 over a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Billie Van was too far back too soon. She stayed on
the fence and worked her way forward, coming on strongly at the end
to gain third, another length back. But the damage had been done at
the start, and the victory belonged to Greys Free Bird, an invader
from Derby Lane in Florida, with $60,000 going to her owner, Joe
Frenette.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran in a lot of stakes in Florida, and won the consolation
race of the St. Pete Derby,'' said Frenette. ``For a while she was
the best dog at Derby Lane, running the four fastest times of the
meet. But then she had a lot of problems. She hit a streak when she
wasn't breaking real well, and that hurt her record.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Green Bay, Wis., Frenette has been in the greyhound
business for nine years. He owns 80 greyhounds, and leases them to
run at various tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife took me to a dog track, Wisconsin Dells, and I got
hooked right there,'' he said. ``After a while, I got into
breeding. It's a lot different from my regular business in
Wisconsin, where I work in radiation protection. It's an
environmental business.''
</P>
<P>
   Frenette obtained Greys Free Bird in a deal that would make Red
Sox general manager Dan Duquette envious, trading with the
Greymeadow Kennel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own Greys Betsy Ross, who ran second in the 1998 Wonderland
Derby to Granny. Greymeadow wanted one of her pups, and I wanted a
pup with Greys Free Bird's breeding (by Fortress-Greys Juliana). I
got lucky, and the pup I traded hasn't run yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Greys Free Bird will continue to race at Wonderland for a month,
and then go to the $60,000 American Derby at Lincoln Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment in the Derby was the effort of 9-5
second choice Flying Penske, who represented Bluffs Run in Iowa.
Flying Penske had won all four qualifiers in handy fashion, but he
broke wide from box No. 7 in the final, and lost too much ground
throughout the race to be a factor, finishing fifth, a half-length
behind 12-1 shot Eloozhun . . . The 2-4-1-5 superfecta returned
$2,431; the trifecta was worth $377, and the quiniela paid $56.80 .
. . The Derby drew 2,115, and the total handle on the 21-race
doubleheader program was $490,439.

HALL HAS ALREADY WON GOLD _ FOR BEST COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Swimmer Gary Hall Sr. went to three Olympics, won
four medals, and carried the American flag in the opening
ceremonies at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the gene pool, meanwhile, swimmer Gary Hall
Jr. went to the Atlanta Olympics, won four medals, and tested
positive for pot.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, a little more than an hour after his father
delivered a rah-rah ``U-S-A!'' speech to a capacity crowd at the
U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, Gary Hall Jr. swam his way back into
the good graces of the gods of Olympus. Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's second-place finish in the 100-meter freestyle _
finishing behind Texas-ex Neil Walker _ made his stormy comeback
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, back when sponsors weren't backstroking away
from him, Gary Hall Jr. endorsed a brand of sunglasses _ the
Grateful Dead signature line. Once he also dyed his blond hair
purple.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited to swim at Texas, it was determined that Hall and the
Longhorns were not the best of fits. So he went home to Arizona
and, questionable training habits aside, became one of the best
freestyle swimmers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Hall won Olympic silver medals in Atlanta in both the 50-
and 100-meter freestyle, it surprised no one. And when he tested
positive for marijuana in early 1998, prompting FINA (swimming's
world governing body) officials to reveal he had committed the same
indiscretion at the Atlanta Games, it didn't surprise many swim
observers, either.
</P>
<P>
   He was slapped with what could have been a three-year
suspension. And while Hall didn't dispute the results of the tests,
he and his lawyers did contest the fact that there was confusion
over whether marijuana was on the International Olympic Committee's
list of banned substances _ it wasn't during the 1996 Olympics, but
it is now _ and whether his second failed test was administered
properly.
</P>
<P>
   His suspension was eventually reduced to three months, not three
years.
</P>
<P>
   His contract with Speedo vanished. His lawyer fees ate up what
was left of his post-Atlanta earnings. And in March 1999, things
really turned worse.
</P>
<P>
   While at a party with his fiancee, the heretofore unflappable,
bulletproof Gary Hall Jr. collapsed and had to be rushed to the
hospital. Doctors diagnosed Hall, who is 26, as a Type I diabetic.
Doctors told him that he would need to watch his diet and
administer insulin shots for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a comeback story, not a surrender.
</P>
<P>
   When the finalists for the men's 100-free marched out Sunday
night at the Indiana University Natatorium, Hall was dressed in a
black robe with a ``Grim Reaper'' hood nearly covering his face _
Sugar Ray Hall. When he shed the robe, Hall revealed a
star-spangled pair of floppy boxing shorts, not unlike the ones
that Apollo Creed wore in ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked these up at a Muhammad Ali Fight Night benefit for
Parkinson's disease,'' Hall later explained. ``It was a black-tie
event, and I ended up wearing them home.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponents in the finals said they tried not to stare at him.
After a few air punches, ``Insulin Ray'' stripped down to his
racing suit.
</P>
<P>
   The race that followed was one of the best of the meet. Walker
hit the turn 0.62 seconds ahead of world-record pace. Behind him
was a thick wave of churning water. Hall, always the sprinter,
seemed to find another gear in the final 25 meters and touched the
wall second in 48.84. Walker was first in 48.71.
</P>
<P>
   When he realized what he had done _ the pot suspension, the
diabetes, the eight insulin injections he has to take to get
through some days _ Hall said a song flashed through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Clash song,'' he explained. ``It says, `I been beat up,
I been thrown out, but not down.' And that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was asked about the ``sweep the medals'' (complete with
broom) speech that his father had given to start this fifth night
of the Olympic trials. All Gary Jr. remembered, however, was that
he was in the warmup pool, eager to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that him rambling on and on?'' Hall Jr. asked, shaking his
head. ``I was thinking, `Start the meet, already.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This will be a different trip to the Olympic Games, the son
promised. His struggle with diabetes has given him a new and
humbling outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot better understanding of what the Olympics is,''
Hall said. ``I don't think I had much of a clue in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot more appreciation of the experience. Maybe that's
why I've grown up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some genes, it seems, just take a little longer to fit. nn

MOORE BACK ON FAMILIAR FOOTING

   NEEDHAM, Mass. _ Joe-Max Moore is the leading scorer in
Revolution history and No. 2 all-time scorer for the US national
team. But though Moore has scored many goals at Foxboro Stadium,
none was as a member of the US national team.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the US meets Barbados in a World Cup qualifying
match Wednesday night, it will be Moore's debut at Foxboro Stadium
in a national team uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something special to me to come back here for this
game,'' Moore said. ``I really enjoyed my time in Boston. I think
this is the best sports city in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Revolution did not do very well when I was
here, the fans were great. I felt I had a good relationship with
them because they respect players who give everything they've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has moved into an even more fanatic situation in
Liverpool. His club, Everton FC, is considered among the powers of
the England Football Association. The crosstown rivalry with
Liverpool FC alone inspires all sorts of competitive craziness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing over there is a battle, a fight, every day,'' said
Moore, noting a cut over his right eye. ``There are so many good
players, and every week is another awesome game. You are training
at a high level every day and almost everybody you are training
with is an international player.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players are hard workers. You have to be, there is so
much competition. Our manager spent a lot of money to bring in
players _ they just signed Duncan Ferguson (Scottish international)
and now we have eight forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Everton also added midfielder Paul Gascoigne and Ghanaian Alex
Nyarko.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you stop improving, you are in trouble,'' Moore said.
``I'm glad I went there. I always wanted an opportunity to play at
the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore arrived the day after Everton took a 3-1 win over
Manchester City in an exhibition game Saturday. Everton opens the
Premier League season against Leeds next Saturday, and manager
Walter Smith likely will use Moore as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to get 20-30 minutes in that game,'' Moore said.
``(Smith) knew when he signed me that I would be away playing in
internationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds corny to say, but any time I get the opportunity to
play for the US I'll take it. Especially in a big game. And this is
a big game. I wouldn't say it's a crisis, but we've still got to
win these games or we will have some trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this is definitely a home game for us and that
isn't always the case in the US. When we played Jamaica in
Washington, it was like playing in Kingston.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United defenders Jeff Agoos (right hamstring) and Eddie
Pope (right ankle, left hip) are probable . . . Gregg Berhalter is
the only US player without a club, after failing to agree to a
contract with Huddersfield Town in England.

REVOLUTION LET DOWN THEIR DEFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution were stunned by the
combination of concentration lapses and controversy in the last
minutes of a 2-1 overtime loss to the MetroStars Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now they will attempt to regroup for the final six games of the
MLS season, starting against Tampa Bay at Foxboro Stadium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution failed to defend effectively against the
MetroStars, despite playing with a man advantage for the final 23
minutes of regulation time. They surrendered the tying goal less
than two minutes after Wolde Harris supplied an 87th-minute lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible in the MLS,'' defender Mauricio Wright
said. ``We didn't control the game in the last two minutes. You
have to protect your goal, clear everything out, and keep doing it
until the referee whistles the end of the game. We have to
concentrate for 90 minutes, then 10 minutes of extra time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say why, it's not anyone's fault. We lost
the game on the field with a one-man advantage. It's a few little
things that cost us and if we don't do better, those things are
going to hurt our chances for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution struggled to create with a passing game, but
revealed individual offensive weapons in Jamar Beasley and Eric
Wynalda, whose potential winning goal was disallowed for an offside
violation in the second minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley had the most effective 90-minute performance of his
career, filling in for Ted Chronopoulos on the left side of
midfield. Beasley established himself against Petter Villegas early
in the match, then began expanding his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had that freedom; it was a matter of taking
advantage of it,'' Beasley said. ``All the guys are always saying
in practice for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley's remarkable speed produced dangerous attacking
situations. On one play late in the game, Beasley failed to connect
with Joe Franchino near the halfway line, but Beasley chased down
his own pass, arriving before the MetroStars could recover.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this was his most rewarding performance with the
Revolution, Beasley replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because we lost. I just have to be ready to come back to
practice and get ready for Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   But coach Fernando Clavijo decided to give the Revolution Sunday
and Monday off. The team has earned only eight of the last 33
possible points and is in danger of falling out of playoff
contention.

KAPLER MOVES STREAK TO 26, BUT RANGERS TUMBLE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Gabe Kapler eventually got the single he
needed to extend his hitting streak to 26 games. But he also got a
sacrifice fly from an earlier at-bat when he needed a hit to keep a
big inning going for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler did hit the ball hard, but the Rangers needed more than
one run batted in from him in that situation and more than two runs
in that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they let Boston Red Sox rookie starter Tomo Ohka
slither out of the jam, and he went on to get his first
major-league victory by beating the Rangers, 4-2, at The Ballpark
in Arlington on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were able to do more damage in their big inning,
scoring four off Rangers starter Kenny Rogers in the third. Rogers
allowed no runs and only three hits in the other seven innings he
pitched, but the Rangers could never overcome the Red Sox's
four-run third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our at-bats, we looked a little sluggish, but their
kid had something to do with that,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Rangers' seventh in 10 games and 10th in 14.
They are 11-18 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting tough, but we just have to keep battling and get
out of this,'' Rangers second baseman Luis Alicea said. ``It seems
like the whole team is in a funk except for one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Kapler, but even he couldn't save the Rangers when
they had a chance to hammer on Ohka in the fourth. Frank
Catalanotto led off the inning with a single to left, and Rusty
Greer followed with a long fly to deep right-center. Center fielder
Carl Everett got under the ball but stumbled at the last moment,
and the ball fell in for a double. Rafael Palmeiro then walked to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler then smacked a scorching liner to center, but right at
Everett. Catalanotto scored, Greer moved to third and Ricky Ledee
followed with a bad-hop single over second baseman Mike Lansing,
making it 4-2. But Ohka got out of the inning by striking out Bill
Haselman and getting Mike Lamb on a fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is hit the ball hard; I can't control where it
goes,'' Kapler said. ``I'm not too concerned about that. It would
have been nice to bloop one in there and score two runs, but I
can't do anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had one more shot at Ohka in the sixth when Kapler
delivered a two-out single to left and Ledee and Haselman walked to
load the bases. But, after Rich Garces replaced Ohka, Lamb hit a
little foul pop toward the Red Sox dugout and third baseman Ed
Sprague made a terrific backhanded catch as he went down the
stairs. That left Lamb hitless in 18 at-bats. He snapped the
hitless streak too late, with a two-out single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a rough few games,'' Lamb said. ``Part of the ups and
downs I guess. It was bound to happen. I don't think it's been this
bad since I've come up. That was a couple a months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox didn't waste their one chance after loading the
bases with two out in the third against Rogers. Nomar Garciaparra
lined a two-run single to left to give the Red Sox a 2-0 lead, and,
after Rogers hit Troy O'Leary, Jason Varitek smacked a single up
the middle to score two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the one big base hit, and we didn't get it,'' Oates
said. ``You could flip a coin on the outcome of the ballgame
tonight. It really came down to who had the two-out single with the
bases loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers lasted eight innings for the seventh time this season but
dropped to 11-10 with a 4.32 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my focus for about four pitches,'' Rogers said. ``I hit
O'Leary with a changeup, and hung a slider to Varitek. You have to
minimize the damage, and I didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maximize the damage when it's the other pitcher in trouble,
and the Rangers didn't do that either. nn

ONE KILLED, SEVERAL WOUNDED IN WAREHOUSE STORE SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hysterical parents grabbed their children, and
customers dove for cover when an attempted armored car holdup at a
Costco store turned into a shootout, leaving one man dead and three
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect who was wounded in the shooting was arrested nearby
after fleeing in a white van. An intensive five-hour search of the
San Fernando Valley neighborhood using police dogs failed to find a
second suspect in the foiled holdup.
</P>
<P>
   About 2:30 p.m. on a busy Sunday, a gunman attempted to hold up
a Sectran Security Inc. guard as he left the Sepulveda Boulevard
store after making a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   As the gunbattle erupted, customers scurried for safety in a
chaotic scene. The exchange took place in the entranceway outside
the food court, and witnesses said about a dozen shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard shot-shot-shot-shot-shot and saw people were running
from the front of the store to the back and left their carts,''
said Laura Berggren, a 39-year-old Van Nuys resident shopping at
the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, it was just horrible! I'm still shaking, I'm so
scared.'' The suspect was arrested by police and taken to Valley
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-year-old man shot in the head was taken to the hospital
where he died at 4 p.m., spokeswoman Kelly Tarelkashe said.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously injured victims were being treated at Providence Holy
Cross at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. Four other people
suffered non-gunshot injuries and were treated at area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a man armed with an AK-47 came up to the armored
guard, who was walking out of the store with his gun drawn, and
demanded the sack of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a robbery. Give me the money,'' Lt. Jim Grayson of
LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division quoted the robber as saying.
</P>
<P>
   As gunfire erupted, a second suspect lurking in the food court
came out of the store.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, who was not injured, ran back to the armored truck
and got in as the suspects fled.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Fire Battalion Chief Richard P. Kay said the scene
was ``manageable but chaotic'' when firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were trying to stabilize patients,'' he said.
``One man fell down and broke his collar bone, and his wife
received shotgun pellets in her legs.''
</P>
<P>
   As ambulances and fire engines rolled to the location at 6100
Sepulveda Boulevard, entrances to the Costco parking lots were
cordoned off. Windows of at least three cars about 75 to 100 feet
from where the gunfire erupted were shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson said the Van Nuys division had more than enough officers
to respond to the shooting despite the massive police presence
downtown in preparation for the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Edgar Marroqun, 22, said his roommate was nearly
carjacked by the gunman, who approached him as he drove out of his
apartment complex at the corner of Kester Avenue and Sylvan Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy with the gun told him to stop, but he put his car in
reverse, got out and took off running to the house,'' Marroqun
said. ``He came in and told us what happened, and when we got out
we saw the guy on the floor, bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrested suspect was spotted by an off-duty LAPD police
officer who called in a report of a suspicious person walking down
Sylvan Street, said spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was walking down the street, apparently carrying a gun, and
the officers told him to give up and he did,'' Pasquariello said.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When their long march ended, under a pearly
moon on a faraway patch of grass, the sweat-stained Red Sox
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night could be forgiven for flashing a smile as wide as the
Texas sky.
</P>
<P>
   They were homeward bound with much more in their lunch buckets
than a savory 4-2 victory over the Rangers in the oven that is The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory allowed the Sox to return home from their 18-day,
16-game dash across America with an 8-8 split, as they prepare to
open a 10-game homestand Monday night against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   They also squeezed the most out of their only scoring
opportunity a night after they had made so little of so many
moments of promise in a dismal 6-3 loss to the Rangers. Squeezing
the hardest were Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek, whose two-run
singles in the fourth provided more runs than the Sox needed to
head home on a high.
</P>
<P>
   The win lifted Boston within 1 1/2 games of the lead in the
wild-card race, though the Sox remained four games behind the
Yankees in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling to be in this position,'' Varitek said,
``knowing that if we get on a roll and start hitting on all
cylinders, we can make a lot of people turn their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Sox, it also was sweet to beat a lefthander, since they
entered the game with a record of 11-16 against lefties. Texas's
Kenny Rogers had been one of the prickliest thorns in their sides,
going 10-3 against Boston before he took Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's loss.
</P>
<P>
   The many splendors of their victory also included the solid
effort of Boston's temporary starter Tomo Ohka, who put the team in
position to win even if his outing was as uneven as his previous
two starts.
</P>
<P>
   A mystery to the Rangers, who never had faced him, Ohka yielded
five hits and four walks before he was lifted with a 4-2 lead and
two outs in the sixth. But he left the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. With Rich Garces on in relief, third baseman Ed
Sprague killed the Rangers' rally by making an acrobatic lunge into
the Boston dugout to snare Mike Lamb's foul pop and end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I was happy to get the win,'' Ohka said through
a Japanese journalist. ``But my pitching was not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garces's was superb, as usual, as El Guapo pitched 2 1/3
hitless innings before yielding to closer Derek Lowe, who yielded a
harmless hit in the ninth for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   To Lowe, the night also presented a sign of better days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time it seems like we're getting ready to do something,
we kind of falter a little bit,'' he said. ``But we're going home
for 10 days and hopefully we can get off on the right foot
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances are good, since the savior, Pedro Martinez (13-4),
is going against Tampa Bay's Dave Eiland (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, Ohka was good enough, mainly because Sox hitters
didn't let a fleeting opportunity vanish.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the third, Mike Lansing beat out an infield hit.
Darren Lewis walked, which brought up Sprague, who was hitting .121
(4 for 33) with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprague surprised the doubters, lashing a single to left
that loaded the bases. Up came Carl Everett, who powered the Sox to
victory Friday night with two home runs but made the final out in
four innings Saturday night, stranding seven.
</P>
<P>
   Everett missed another chance, lining to short for the second
out. But Garciaparra picked him up, lining an 0-2 pitch to left for
a single that scored Lansing and Lewis for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers then hit Troy O'Leary with a pitch to load the bases
again, this time for Varitek. The catcher promptly muscled a single
to center to score Sprague and Garciaparra, making it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a pitch to hit,'' said Varitek, who came to the plate in
a 2-for-18 slump. ``But the big thing is, I'm just trying to be
more consistent with the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohka escaped a serious scare an inning later, after Frank
Catalanotto singled and Rusty Greer doubled. Following the Sox'
doctrine on Rafael Palmeiro, Ohka walked the Texas slugger to load
the bases with none out. It was the seventh walk Palmeiro received
in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was particularly risky because next up was Gabe
Kapler, who was on a .372 tear.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler lined a sacrifice fly to center to score Catalanotto.
Ricky Ledee then punched a bad-hop single past the lunging Lansing
at second, bringing home Greer and making it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ohka spared himself further damage by fanning former Sox catcher
Bill Haselman and getting Lamb to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Ohka allowed only two runners in the first five
innings, a one-out double by Catalanotto in the first and a walk to
Ledee in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five hits Ohka yielded, one was Kapler's sixth-inning
single to left, which extended his hitting streak to 26 games, the
longest in the majors since Shawn Green, then of Toronto, hit
safely in 28 straight last year.

   Walker pictures Olympics with 100 freestyle victory
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It was one of those pictures truly worth a
thousand words: A disconsolate Neil Walker sitting on the edge of
the warmup pool at the Indiana University-Purdue University
Natatorium as his coach at the University of Texas, Eddie Reese,
tried to console him.
</P>
<P>
   The photo was taken by Walker's mother, Barbara, moments after
the men's 100-meter freestyle at the 1996 U.S. Olympic Swimming
Trials and pretty much said it all about what had transpired for
Walker, who had finished seventh in the event and missed the last
relay spot by one-hundredth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the setting and the stakes were the same, but the
picture was completely different, Walker this time leaving no doubt
about his place on the U.S. Olympic team in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who competed for Texas from 1995-98, won the 100
freestyle in 48.71 seconds, beating out Gary Hall Jr., who recorded
a 48.84. Although Walker had already qualified for a spot on the
team by finishing second in the 100-meter backstroke, his showing
in the 100 freestyle established him as a top challenger to Russian
world-record holder Alexander Popov in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Walker posted his lifetime best (48.55) in the semifinals,
making him the fourth-fastest man in the event and putting him
within range of Popov's world record (48.21).
</P>
<P>
   ``The 100 free is going to be an amazing event at the Olympics,
like it was here,'' Walker said after his victory. ``I think it's
going to take a world-record performance to win. But it's such a
hard thing to predict. One of us Americans has a shot at it (the
record), and we have to go to Sydney believing we can (break it).''
</P>
<P>
   Walker found himself making plans for Australia on a night when
one of the United States' brightest stars, breaststroke specialist
Ed Moses, saw at least part of his Olympic dream die.
</P>
<P>
   Moses tried to set a blistering pace in the 200 breaststroke but
faded at the end and finished fourth, out of the running for
Sydney. First place went to 19-year-old Kyle Salyards. Second went
to former Stanford swimmer Tom Wilkens, whose chances at making the
team had dwindled after he finished third in the 400 individual
medley.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moses will swim the 100 breaststroke in Sydney, he will
be doing less than had been expected of him on the basis of wins in
both breaststroke events at the spring nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Moses, entering his junior year at Virginia, declined to speak
to reporters after the race but expressed his feelings to an
official with USA Swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' the official quoted Moses as
saying. ``I'm really disappointed. I don't know what happened. I'll
get over it and be ready for the 100 in Sydney, but tonight
definitely didn't go the way I planned or wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Tucker, a former Auburn swimmer, and Jason Lezak, who
competed for Cal-Santa Barbara, were the fourth-and fifth-place
finishers in the 100 freestyle, meaning they are assured of 400
freestyle relay spots. University of California sophomore Anthony
Ervin and UT ex Josh Davis were fifth and sixth, making them relay
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who grew up in Verona, Wis., and believes fishing is
about the best thing life has to offer, is far different from Hall,
who has a Top Gun mentality and appeared on the deck for Sunday's
race wearing red, white and blue boxing trunks over his swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the swagger is one of the year's most compelling
stories. Since the 1996 Olympics, when he finished second to Popov
in both the 50 and 100 freestyles, Hall has faced a variety of
hurdles, including a three-month suspension in 1998 for testing
positive for marijuana and the diagnosis in March 1999 that he is a
diabetic. He treats the disease with insulin injections _ five
Sunday, he said, and sometimes as many as eight a day _ and glucose
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Clash song that says, `I've been beat up, but I'm
not knocked down,''' he said, ``and that's me. You can't keep a
good man down.''

 &HT;    A MATTER OF FAITH: ORTHODOX JUDAISM AND SEN. JOSEPH
LIEBERMAN(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By MAUREEN JENKINS(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Sen. Joseph Lieberman's selection as Al Gore's
Democratic vice presidential running mate last week, Americans
probably have heard, read and seen more about Orthodox Judaism than
at any time in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a 58-year-old Orthodox Jew from Connecticut, was a
historic choice, marking the first time a Jew - not to mention a
highly observant one - was tapped by the Democrats or Republicans
for vice president. And to an America that's largely unfamiliar
with this most traditional branch of Judaism, the selection
prompted questions wondering whether Lieberman would be able to
easily function in so high an office.
</P>
<P>
   But having been a Connecticut state senator and attorney general
as well as a two-term U.S. senator, Lieberman's no stranger to
weaving his public service work around his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lieberman phenomenon is growing out of a changed world
where it's become increasingly easier for American Jews to live
productive lives in an increasingly tolerant American world,'' said
Jeffrey S. Gurock, who teaches American Jewish history and studies
American Orthodoxy at Yeshiva University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits - and regular folks - have wondered how Lieberman,
who strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath from sundown Friday to
sundown Saturday, would be able to cast important votes, attend
crucial meetings or consult on matters of national importance. And
even (beginitalic)before(enditalic) the election, how he'll
campaign without violating the Sabbath and Jewish holy days down
the stretch. The two holiest days on the Jewish calendar, Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur - as well as Sukkot and Simhat Torah - fall
during the critical campaign crunch of late September and October.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder whether Lieberman, if elected would be able to
attend his own inauguration as it's scheduled for Jan. 20, 2001,
which falls on the Sabbath. And for that matter, swear to uphold
the office, as Orthodox Jews never swear in God's name but rather
affirm to carry out a task.
</P>
<P>
   These and other questions are ``legitimate,'' says Gurock. But
he says that Lieberman showed he ``has cogent answers for these.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews believe that the Torah, the first five books of
the Bible, and Halachah, or practical Jewish law, govern all
aspects of daily life, from work to play to religious rituals. But
despite adherence to laws Jews believe were given to the prophet
Moses more than 3,000 years ago, Halachah makes allowances for
public servants like Lieberman to handle critical or life-or-death
situations, even on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   And in those cases where Lieberman questions if his work
conflicts with Jewish law, says Rabbi Steven Dworken, executive
vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, which
represents Orthodox rabbis, ``he's going to have to feel
comfortable with the [rabbis] he consults with on religious
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6million Jews live in the United States, with about
8percent identifying themselves as Orthodox. The 1999 Annual Survey
of Jewish Opinion found 34percent are Reform and 31percent
Conservative, with most of the rest calling themselves secular or
cultural Jews.
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans draw upon images of the bearded,
black-wearing Hasidim when they think of the Orthodox, many - like
Lieberman - wear regular contemporary clothing and live within the
mainstream of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you wear a black coat doesn't mean you don't have
a cell phone or use a computer or live in the real world,'' said
Betty Ehrenberg, director of international affairs for the Orthodox
Union, which represents about 1,000 Orthodox synagogues across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   While their numbers aren't large, Orthodox Jews are represented
in high levels of American government. There's U.S. Rep. Robert
Wexler, a Democrat from south Florida, and Sheldon Silver, speaker
of the New York State Assembly. Even the U.S. ambassador to Egypt,
Daniel Kurtzer, is Orthodox and keeps a kosher kitchen in his
overseas residence.
</P>
<P>
   And while many might see an Orthodox Jew's life as tough, says
33-year-old Rabbi Chaim Silver of the Young Israel of Phoenix
congregation, ``for me, it's definitely not a sacrifice. It's a
state of awareness where instead of being led by outside cultures
and the secular society, we're {hellip} living our lives the way
God would have us to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about a world-class runner or sprinter and tell
him he can't eat Baby Ruth candy bars for breakfast, it's not a
sacrifice for him. It's a discipline and a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Jewish Sabbath, Orthodox Jews refrain from turning lights
on or off, talking on telephones, operating electric-powered
devices or writing. But ironically today's high-tech advances make
it easier for observant Jews to keep the laws. Automatic timers on
electric lights allow the Orthodox to still see on the Sabbath, and
voice-mail takes messages that Jews can return later on.
</P>
<P>
   With a better understanding of Jewish Orthodoxy, says Gurock,
many Americans may come to consider Lieberman not only ``a role
model for Jewish people, but for religious people of all faiths.''

   ``ROLLING STONE''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Horton takes a gander at George W. Bush's environmental
record as Texas governor; Wil S. Hylton profiles Hugh Hefner (an
assignment that - surprise - requires extensive research at Playboy
mansion parties); Barry Walters surveys a slew of Beach Boys
reissues; and Chris Heath examines the Tao of Keanu, which is -
surprise again - way heavy. At one point, Heath asks the shirtless
cover-boy actor/bassist a vague question about wanting to direct.
``He lets out a kind of quiet sigh,'' Heath writes. ``At its worst,
it's like this. You ask Keanu Reeves a question and {hellip} just
wait. Out in space, planets collide, stars go supernova. On Earth,
forests fall, animals screech and roar. People shout and rant and
weep with anger and joy and just for the hell of it. And, all this
time, Reeves sits there, entirely silent.'' For 72 seconds. Then
comes the answer: ``No, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS''
</P>
<P>
   The cover story examines the marketing competition for the
adventure-travel crowd, a demographic growing wider and deeper and
more sore by the second. Cash-heavy seniors are indulging in the
boonie-based perspiration arts as are footloose boomers and their
skateboard-toting kids. Sales of recreational gear and togs now
reportedly top $80 billion. Two-thirds of all Americans wear or use
such goods at least once a month, up from 50 percent just six years
ago, the magazine says. (Presumably freeing up a lot of room in
bowling alleys, perhaps a fine topic for an upcoming report.) The
second feature looks at domestic migration trends among the
rootless-professional class, concluding that consumption habits of
New Economy workers will enhance greatly the quality of life for
aficionados of quaint ethnic restaurants. (beginitalic)Opa!
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``AIR &AMP; SPACE''
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound readers will enjoy the high-flying features about
colorful commercial paint jobs on airliners, the Northrop F-20
Tigershark and a brief history of America's pre-NASA space program.
The cover story isn't really about the goofy car-plane hybrid
pictured there but rather an overview of the aviation photography
of Ben Ross. As it turns out, an airborne Ross shot of the Convair
adorns the studio wall of writer Chad Slattery. The 1948 photo
``captured something essential about postwar America.'' Slattery
writes. ``I look at that picture today and feel the era's
confidence, its faith in technology, its extravagant and often
reckless consumerism.'' The issue's don't-miss feature, though, is
a collection of pre-World War I letters from Marine Corps pilot
Francis Evans to his lady friend, Elizabeth Kibbey, who would later
become Evans' wife. It's a lovely time-capsule look at the
open-cockpit days.
</P>
<P>
   ``BRILL'S CONTENT''
</P>
<P>
   A small box floating on the cover says, ``Skepticism is a
virtue.'' We're down with that. Other cover words reference stories
about dishy (beginitalic)New York Times (enditalic)media writer
Alex Kuczynski, a David Halberstam update of (beginitalic)The
Powers That Be (enditalic)and a detailed look at Joan Didion's
influence on a bunch of contemporary writers, including Maureen
Dowd and Anna Quindlen. In the cover story, Seth Mnookin looks at
George W. Bush's relationship with the press and concludes that the
candidate's sometimes-goofy affability is winning the affection of
at least a few members of the traveling press corps. One conclusive
pull quote sums it up best: ``Bush has neutralized the biggest
question about his candidacy, his perceived lack of intelligence,
by letting reporters see that he is a sharp enough guy when engaged
in casual conversation.'' The skeptical cover headline labels
Bush's chummy tactic ``The Charm Offensive.''

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This is the type of hitter the Red Sox need
as they return home from the make-or-break, 16-games-in-18-days
trip that did neither.
</P>
<P>
   --One who comes off the disabled list after missing 20 games and
hits a home run on the first pitch he sees, then hits nine more in
his next 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   --One who hurts himself again, refuses to go on the DL, and
twice pinch hits with the bases loaded and delivers hits, then in
his first game back in the lineup hits two home runs, including a
game-winner in the bottom of the 13th, and goes 4 for 4 the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   --One who hits a grand slam and knocks in six runs one game, and
10 days later hits an inside-the-park home run and a game-winning,
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   --One who hits a home run in his first at-bat after learning
he's been suspended 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   --One who hits a home run in his first game back after serving
his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Red Sox already have that player in Carl
Everett, who was Houston's hottest hitter down the stretch last
season when the Astros won a division title and who will have to
come close to doing the same now if the Sox hope to be playing
again in October.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the old Boston Braves mantra, Spahn and Sain and
pray for rain?
</P>
<P>
   These days with the Sox, it's Nomar and Carl and . . . well,
there isn't anything else.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's series finale victory over the Texas
Rangers, the Sox were 8-8 despite batting just .223 on the trip. In
nine of the 16 games (that three-game stayover in Boston last
weekend was just another road stop), the Sox scored four runs or
fewer 10 times, and scored one run four times. They hit just 15
home runs in 16 games, no more than two in any game, and none in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach hit .111 with a home run and one RBI. There were
no home runs and three RBIs from .180-hitting Troy O'Leary. Jose
Offerman was hitless in all 10 of his at-bats before he went on the
disabled list. Of the newcomers, Mike Lansing was the most
successful, but all 14 of his hits were singles. Manny Alexander
had more home runs (1) than O'Leary, Trot Nixon, Rico Brogna, and
Bernard Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hasn't torn it up since being reinstated to the lineup
nine days ago, batting just .206 (7 for 34, 0 for his last 10), but
his two-homer, five-RBI game against the Rangers Friday night was
the biggest by any Sox player in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, as always, has held up his end, playing every day
of this marathon (and all 19 innings of that marathon in Seattle)
and batting .354, with five home runs and 14 RBIs, all team-leading
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all falling on two players, Garciaparra and Everett.
O'Leary, who is chasing a lot of high pitches, insists his
off-field woes are not responsible for his current slump, but if
there is anything else at play, he isn't saying, though there are
definitely grounds for suspicion. Offerman is ready to come off the
DL, but with his sore knee and subpar play, he looks eligible for
the AARP. Daubach, who was used as a No. 3 hitter while Everett was
suspended, was in the No. 8 hole Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   He's lost at the plate. The new guys, meanwhile, are struggling
to find their place. Sprague hasn't been the answer at third. Jimy
Williams hasn't played Brogna enough to find out what he can do at
first.
</P>
<P>
   And the myth perpetuated by the Red Sox that Jim Rice is a
terrific hitting coach has been exposed this season. Teams like the
Mariners, White Sox, and A's all have an idea of what they're doing
when they go to the plate. Gabe Kapler, the Rangers outfielder who
was batting .241 when he began his current 26-game hitting streak,
was helped immeasurably by batting coach Rudy Jaramillo, who
suggested a change in his leg lift.
</P>
<P>
   If Rice has a plan, he isn't sharing it with the people he's
being paid to help. Rice may have Hall of Fame credentials as a
player, but as a teacher, he would flunk John Silber's MCAS test.
Where are the adjustments being made by O'Leary or Daubach? Who's
there to help them see what they're doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game, Jason Varitek was studying videotape with
first-base coach Tommy Harper. Call it a coincidence, but Varitek
delivered a two-run single, giving him 10 RBIs on the trip, second
only to Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the Sox' hitting woes, they lost little ground on
this trip. They were in third place in the AL East when it started,
3 1/2 games behind the Yankees and a half-game behind the Blue
Jays. They were in second place Sunday, four games behind the
Yankees but a game and a half ahead of the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild-card race, they were 2 1/2 games behind with three
teams ahead of them when the trip began. They are now 1 1/2 behind,
with just two teams ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings it all back to Everett. His relationship with
Williams remains strained since their shouting match in the
manager's office last weekend. Neither man has approached the other
about making peace, but at least it hasn't gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   Everett still isn't talking to the Boston print media, but on
Saturday, he did a radio interview with Dennis Quinn, a
transplanted good ol' boy from Pawtucket now working for KEYS in
Corpus Christi who reminisced with him about his Houston days. And
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, he did a taped interview with Sox broadcaster Joe
Castiglione that was aired on WEEI's radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Castiglione asked Everett if has he had any trouble staying
focused given all that has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not for me,'' Everett said. ``I think a lot of other folks
have missed a bit. For me, I already threw it on a back burner.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not just blowing smoke. Ask anyone in the Sox clubhouse.
When the game begins, it doesn't matter with whom he may have been
warring, his sole enemy occupies the other dugout.
</P>
<P>
   That's a great quality to have, especially in a place like
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I let bygones be bygones,'' Everett said in his radio
bit. ``A lot of times, those bygones won't go away. Sometimes,
you've got to do things to let them know.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he was referring to his critics. But if he plays the
way he did down the stretch in Houston, and doesn't get sent to the
penalty box again, he'll find that even in Boston, memories can be
short, too.

   ``ROLLING STONE''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Horton takes a gander at George W. Bush's environmental
record as Texas governor; Wil S. Hylton profiles Hugh Hefner (an
assignment that - surprise - requires extensive research at Playboy
mansion parties); Barry Walters surveys a slew of Beach Boys
reissues; and Chris Heath examines the Tao of Keanu, which is -
surprise again - way heavy. At one point, Heath asks the shirtless
cover-boy actor/bassist a vague question about wanting to direct.
``He lets out a kind of quiet sigh,'' Heath writes. ``At its worst,
it's like this. You ask Keanu Reeves a question and {hellip} just
wait. Out in space, planets collide, stars go supernova. On Earth,
forests fall, animals screech and roar. People shout and rant and
weep with anger and joy and just for the hell of it. And, all this
time, Reeves sits there, entirely silent.'' For 72 seconds. Then
comes the answer: ``No, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS''
</P>
<P>
   The cover story examines the marketing competition for the
adventure-travel crowd, a demographic growing wider and deeper and
more sore by the second. Cash-heavy seniors are indulging in the
boonie-based perspiration arts as are footloose boomers and their
skateboard-toting kids. Sales of recreational gear and togs now
reportedly top $80 billion. Two-thirds of all Americans wear or use
such goods at least once a month, up from 50 percent just six years
ago, the magazine says. (Presumably freeing up a lot of room in
bowling alleys, perhaps a fine topic for an upcoming report.) The
second feature looks at domestic migration trends among the
rootless-professional class, concluding that consumption habits of
New Economy workers will enhance greatly the quality of life for
aficionados of quaint ethnic restaurants. (beginitalic)Opa!

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``AIR &AMP; SPACE''
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound readers will enjoy the high-flying features about
colorful commercial paint jobs on airliners, the Northrop F-20
Tigershark and a brief history of America's pre-NASA space program.
The cover story isn't really about the goofy car-plane hybrid
pictured there but rather an overview of the aviation photography
of Ben Ross. As it turns out, an airborne Ross shot of the Convair
adorns the studio wall of writer Chad Slattery. The 1948 photo
``captured something essential about postwar America.'' Slattery
writes. ``I look at that picture today and feel the era's
confidence, its faith in technology, its extravagant and often
reckless consumerism.'' The issue's don't-miss feature, though, is
a collection of pre-World War I letters from Marine Corps pilot
Francis Evans to his lady friend, Elizabeth Kibbey, who would later
become Evans' wife. It's a lovely time-capsule look at the
open-cockpit days.
</P>
<P>
   ``BRILL'S CONTENT''
</P>
<P>
   A small box floating on the cover says, ``Skepticism is a
virtue.'' We're down with that. Other cover words reference stories
about dishy (beginitalic)New York Times (enditalic)media writer
Alex Kuczynski, a David Halberstam update of (beginitalic)The
Powers That Be (enditalic)and a detailed look at Joan Didion's
influence on a bunch of contemporary writers, including Maureen
Dowd and Anna Quindlen. In the cover story, Seth Mnookin looks at
George W. Bush's relationship with the press and concludes that the
candidate's sometimes-goofy affability is winning the affection of
at least a few members of the traveling press corps. One conclusive
pull quote sums it up best: ``Bush has neutralized the biggest
question about his candidacy, his perceived lack of intelligence,
by letting reporters see that he is a sharp enough guy when engaged
in casual conversation.'' The skeptical cover headline labels
Bush's chummy tactic ``The Charm Offensive.''

<P>
   ``I Loved You All''
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Sharp
</P>
<P>
   (Hyperion, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I've grown to be too much for myself to
handle,'' widow Marguerite Daigle tells her daughters, Mahalia and
Penny, one day in 1977, and with that she allows herself to be
taken to a convalescent home for alcoholic women, leaving the
girls, who are 15 and 8, in the care of a baby-sitter, Isabel
Flood. That Flood is a religious zealot and militant right-to-lifer
is something Penny already knows. She suspects, in fact, that her
older sister wants to replace their mother with Isabel. The truth
is that Mahalia craves structure and finds it in Isabel while the
rebellious Penny has other things in mind - their divergent needs
are reminiscent of the young sisters in Marilynne Robinson's
wonderful novel (beginitalic)Housekeeping(enditalic). Penny's
narration has all the clear-eyed honesty we expect from a child,
which makes it the perfect voice to tell a surprisingly funny story
about that most difficult of issues, abortion.

<P>
   ``In Lieu of Flowers''
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Cobb
</P>
<P>
   (Pantheon, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks, the tears start early. Fortunately,
the cry is worth the trouble. Cobb has written a brief but potent
reflection on death and grief, subtitled (beginitalic)A
Conversation for the Living(enditalic). In essays about her
experiences with her parents and friends, she discusses the
transcendent opportunities hidden within the act of facing death
with loved ones and the healing process that follows great
suffering. She laments that too many people struggle with both.
Why, she asks, ``is it easier to express our grief for an English
princess in a French tunnel than it is to visit a dying neighbor
down the block? Would that we could bring a fearlessness to a
friend's deathbed or to a grieving family as easily as we now bring
a casserole to an already full table on the day of the funeral.''
Her book is a thought-provoking look at something we all face
eventually, a rite of passage that ``dares us to define what really
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice Neel''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Ann Temkin
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $45)
</P>
<P>
   Alice Neel first painted herself, wearing only her eyeglasses
and holding an artist's brush, just four years before she died in
1984. She was 80 and looked it. ``Unsmiling, ungiving, the portrait
is not calculated to please anyone, least of all the misshapen
sitter,'' writes Ann Temkin, a curator at the Philadelphia Museum
of Art. ``Like much of Neel's work over the course of five decades,
the painting is happy to look wrong.'' One can't help but think
that the outspoken Neel would have delighted in that description of
her work, the bold, honest portraits that so often ``looked wrong''
(one is her depiction of Joe Gould, the Greenwich Village ``bum''
immortalized by Joseph Mitchell in ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' the
profile that appeared in the(beginitalic) New Yorker(enditalic)).
This retrospective of Neel's work contains 75 paintings and
watercolors and a discussion by many of Neel's subjects on the
sometimes unsettling experience of sitting for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Burning of Bridget Clearly''
</P>
<P>
   By Angela Bourke
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   In March of 1895, a 26-year-old Irish dressmaker named Bridget
Cleary was tortured and burned to death by her husband, who had
come to believe that she was a changeling left behind by fairies.
Bridget had been clever, ambitious and sexual - it was even rumored
that she'd had a lover. Her murder, the ensuing trial of Michael
Cleary and a group of his relatives and neighbors charged with
aiding in the murder caused a sensation in the British newspapers,
coloring the debate over home rule in Ireland and heightening the
perception of the Irish peasantry as savages. Bourke's retelling of
the murder and its reflection of the religion and politics of the
time is exhaustively researched and thick with details. She calls
the crime, which was rooted in superstition and confusion, ``the
sort of human tragedy in which nobody is entirely to blame or
entirely innocent, and there are no winners.''

 &HT;    RACIAL ISSUES STIR CASA GRANDE, ARIZ., FUROR(a) 
 &HT;    (Resending, changing slug from Bad Cops)
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By EDYTHE JENSEN(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a Black teenager driving in the streets of Casa Grande, Byron
Jackson said he expected police to pull him over.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 35-year-old city councilman in neighboring Eloy, Jackson
said he was stopped many times by Casa Grande police ``because they
pulled you over if you were young and Black and were driving a
half-decent vehicle. They still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's exposure of two police officers' racially charged
phone pranks are calling attention to what Jackson and others say
is a history of racial profiling by Casa Grande police.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chief has minimized the frequency of prank calls
and described other bizarre practical jokes at minority residents'
expense as ``isolated incidents,'' others see them as representing
a pattern of harassment of racial minorities that has gone on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-grade teacher Laura Mims started Casa Grande's Black
History and Juneteenth celebrations 10 years ago and said she has
been complaining to civic leaders for longer than that about ``the
police targeting young people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good here,'' she said. ``I tell my grandson: if the
police stop you, say, 'Yes, sir,' get his name, badge number and
ask him why he stopped you. Give him your phone number, your
address and call a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Ken Buchanan said he has heard of no racial
problems between residents and police.
</P>
<P>
   Mims said her 14-year-old grandson was handcuffed and thrown to
the ground outside a convenience store where he was buying a snack
this year. It was late on a Saturday night, and the youngster and
his friends were out past curfew, but police were overly aggressive
and abusive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Grande native Dora Vasquez, who now chairs the Arizona
Civil Rights Board appointed by the governor, said state programs
aimed at eliminating racial profiling and increasing police
awareness of diversity aren't reaching her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've witnessed firsthand police harassing children in Casa
Grande,'' she said. ``In their zeal to catch gang members, they
stop people for the color of their skin, the kind of jewelry they
wear or a tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Profiling conference
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, Jackson and Mims recently attended a racial profiling
conference sponsored by the Arizona Attorney General's Office's
Civil Rights Division. All said the conference was enlightening and
that they were dismayed that no representatives of the city or Casa
Grande Police Department attended.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Robert Huddleston said earlier that he intends to
send a representative to the next scheduled racial profiling
conference. He did not return phone calls to his office Friday, but
said earlier that he intends to require additional cultural
sensitivity training for his officers within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted during personnel hearings last week that two years
ago he listened to and laughed at a racially derogatory crank phone
call made by one of his officers. In it, the officer mimicked a
Black man calling for a female police officer to help him change a
child's diaper.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is vocal in her criticism of some individual police
officers, Mims said Huddleston may be Casa Grande's best hope for
change.
</P>
<P>
   More responsive
</P>
<P>
   Since Huddleston took the office two years ago, he has been more
responsive to residents than his predecessors, she said. Mims
praised the chief for punishing Officers Galen Flynn and Chris
Western for making racially derogatory prank phone calls to their
own department.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the former chief, we complained, we met with him, but he
never did anything,'' she said. ``It's a good sign that this chief
let these officers know they weren't above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   He said he grew up with Flynn and Western and is convinced
they're not racists. Their prank call was tasteless, he said, ``but
it was the sort of thing supervisors let slide for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eloy councilman said minorities in Casa Grande don't trust
city officials . Their complaints have gone unanswered for years,
and incidents of racial improprieties have been covered up, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Home to about 33,000, Casa Grande's population is 37percent
Hispanic and about 5percent Black. The mayor, city manager,
seven-member City Council and police chief are all White
non-Hispanic males.
</P>
<P>
   ``In small towns, things like this can be hidden. It's your word
against somebody else's,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Support for chief urged
</P>
<P>
   Casa Grande police Sgt. Lupe Reyes, a Hispanic native of Pinal
County, said that if residents are outraged by the racist pranks,
they need to support the chief, who's doing something about them.
He said the department doesn't deserve the criticism that the two
officers' behavior is generating.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence came out at Flynn and Western's personnel hearing last
week that Reyes' brother Rudy - also a Casa Grande police officer -
made a tape that mocked Blacks, which was played for the chief in
1998 and has been used as entertainment at police parties and
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence also shows that Lupe Reyes was a victim of a police
prank. Another officer set off a firecracker while Reyes was
inspecting an apartment building at night. The firecracker made
Reyes believe gunshots had been fired. He called for backup, and
two innocent residents were detained for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never reported the incident because he believed it
was an isolated prank.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reyes are sons of Pinal County Sheriff Frank Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Pranks, racial profiling and harassment of minorities have never
been condoned by the department, Lupe Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls are embarrassments, but the chief's disciplinary
reaction deserves praise, not criticism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the community doesn't like what they're hearing, if the
community is outraged, they need to support our chief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Bridges, 82, sat in the audience of the two officers'
hearing last week and listened to the prank tapes. A 50-year Casa
Grande resident, Bridges didn't want to talk about the tapes, she
said she just came to watch and listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with the police,'' she said. ``When I came
here, the schools were segregated; everything was segregated.''

 &HT;    (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS)
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some notes on battling Satan in the movies, for the producers of
(beginitalic)Bless (enditalic)(beginitalic)the Child:(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Prince of Darkness cannot be defeated with
conventional weapons. Pistols and tear gas are no good. You need
some sort of ancient dagger or book of runes.
</P>
<P>
   When arriving at Satan's residence to serve an arrest warrant,
do not enter the premises without backup, especially if said backup
disappears into some sort of evil mist.
</P>
<P>
   Do not, under any circumstances, sneak into a house full of
devil worshipers armed only with a kitchen knife and a winning
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid the room with the big altar in it. Bad things happen
there.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Satan plays poorly with a lead. As soon as he gets the
upper hand, his imps start strutting around and talking trash. This
is the time to act.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the makers of (beginitalic)Bless the Child
(enditalic)didn't remember many of these important guidelines and
ended up with a pretty dopey movie, which is watchable just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger stars as Maggie, a nurse who raises her infant
niece, Cody (Holliston Coleman), after the girl is dumped on
Maggie's doorstep by her druggie sister (Angela Bettis). By age 6,
we learn, Cody is ``special,'' that is, she can make objects spin,
reanimate dead animals, simple stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cody is also the target of evil Eric Stark (Rufus
Sewell), a cult leader with a direct line to Lucifer. Stark wants
to kidnap Maggie and turn her to evil, much like Darth Vader tried
with Luke Skywalker, except with less stuff blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie gets some help from handsome FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy
Smits, who apparently never turned in his (beginitalic)NYPD Blue
(enditalic)trench coat). Travis is trying to solve a series of
child murders, and - well, you can see where all this is going.
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of the fun of (beginitalic)Bless the
Child(enditalic). Hokey and contrived, yes. But it holds your
attention, in that Saturday-matinee sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of Satan-battling movies before it,
(beginitalic)Bless the Child (enditalic)comes with the
(beginitalic)Exorcist (enditalic)starter set: crying statues,
self-lighting candles, sinister ancient symbols and the handy
all-knowing priest. The dialogue is uniformly weak, when it's not
simply lifted from other films.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the internal logic makes no sense. The devil worshipers
constantly capture Maggie but never finish her off. Maggie meets a
street urchin (Christina Ricci) who knows everything but hasn't
bothered to tell the cops. Satan can conjure hundreds of demons but
is easily thwarted by the closing door of a subway car.
</P>
<P>
   While Basinger thrives in certain roles (case in point, her
Oscar for (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential(enditalic)), she doesn't
really have the range to carry a whole movie. Smits is serviceable
as the FBI agent but tends to fade into the woodwork on the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the movie gets a lift from Sewell
((beginitalic)Dark City(enditalic)), who plays a pretty good imp.
And Coleman, who is only 7 years old, does a splendid job as Cody.
</P>
<P>
   All told, (beginitalic)Bless the Child (enditalic)is a pretty
mindless movie. But it has some thrills and chills, and doesn't
descend into quite the gorefest of films such as (beginitalic)End
of Days(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   If only they knew the rules.

<P>
   I really liked (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)the
first time I saw it - when it was called (beginitalic)The Longest
Yard(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was (beginitalic)Major League(enditalic). Or
(beginitalic)Necessary Roughness(enditalic). Or any of a dozen
sports movies that feature a ragtag band of misfits who succeed
against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)lives
up to its name. It's essentially a collection of spare parts from
other movies, a cheesy knockoff without a whit of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Keanu Reeves as a quarterback who blew the big
college game but gets called back to action after NFL players go on
strike. The movie wastes no time in trotting out every sports movie
stereotype and overused scene.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement team (the fictional Washington Sentinels),
includes the usual gang of underdogs we see in every movie: the
psycho linebacker, the overweight sumo wrestler, the wisecracking
receiver with bad hands, the oddball kicker, the gun-toting
gangster and the Bible-thumping preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the platitude-spewing coach, played by Gene
Hackman. He becomes a parody of himself about halfway through,
mostly because he's stuck reading dialogue left over from
(beginitalic)Hoosiers(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder why Warner Bros. made this turkey at all,
especially since the last NFL strike was in 1987. You get the idea
the script was moldering on a shelf somewhere, right next to the
(beginitalic)Rocky VI (enditalic)screenplay. Whoops, I guess that's
a bad example.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, its anti-union message finds really great timing,
given the current actors' strike in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the story, which is simply a collection of scenes
from other sports movies. There's the initial goofy practice
sequence, the argument in the cafeteria, the contemplative moment
in the empty stadium, the bar brawl, the jail cell dance number and
big locker room speech.
</P>
<P>
   There are some laughs here and there, but they mostly dry up in
the second half, when the movie just pounds out the formula.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)also features John
Madden and Pat Summerall, real-life football announcers who read
their lines with all the enthusiasm of Soviet newscasters. Madden's
performance is especially stilted, sounding much like the
mix-and-match one-liners he records for his ubiquitous football
video games.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the movie doesn't even get its football right.
Since when does the season end on Thanksgiving? Since when do the
cheerleaders go on strike with the players? Since when do teams
carry only one quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's only a movie, but it's certainly likely to attract
football fans, who will spot the obvious flaws, such as skinny
Reeves shucking off 250-pound linebackers on his way to the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   At the screening I attended, the film broke with about 20
minutes left in the movie. That gave the audience time to guess at
the ending.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, we all guessed right.

<P>
   Your story goes here.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)But I'm a Cheerleader (enditalic)is a confused
movie about a confused young woman.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, you can understand the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the movie plays as broad satire, lampooning
intolerance against homosexuality. In other places, it seems to
lash out at gay males, portraying them as mincing stereotypes.
Embossed atop the whole thing is a love story that seems more
suited to a John Hughes movie, if he ever made a film about
same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a movie that tries to be about something but will
probably just offend everyone. That's a shame, because director
Jamie Babbit had some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts out in amusing fashion, as we meet Megan
(Natasha Lyonne), a cheerleader who's confused about her sexuality.
Her boyfriend loves to make out, but she couldn't be more bored
with him. In fact, she's more interested in her fellow
cheerleaders, but she's not quite sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Megan's ultraconservative parents, who immediately arrange
an intervention (a hilarious scene by itself) and ship Megan off to
a homosexual deprogramming camp. There she meets counselor Mike
(RuPaul, out of drag and wearing a ``straight is great'' T-shirt)
and Mary (Cathy Moriarty), who runs the home while trying to
deprogram her own hunky son (Eddie Cibrian).
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a ``message'' movie, the counselors are portrayed
as unsympathetic, tin-plated ideologues who spout ridiculous
theories on sexuality. Much of this is played for laughs, though it
often flies way over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The sets are fun, done in bright colors with a sort of Kmart
chic. The house where the camp is held is even surrounded by a pink
picket fence. The costumes (blue for the boys, pink for the girls)
add a few laughs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those touches give the movie an unconventional tone, somewhat
akin to John Waters' (beginitalic)Hairspray(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   For the first half-hour, (beginitalic)But I'm a Cheerleader
(enditalic)is mostly a farce, as Moriarty tries silly methods to
make her charges behave ``normally.'' There are plenty of sight
gags and double entendre, all aimed at showing that the treatment
isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's almost having the opposite effect as Megan strikes
up a friendship with Graham (Clea DuVall), a girl who doesn't buy
the brainwashing but pretends to go along. At this point, the film
starts to unravel, lurching from satire to a serious love story.
</P>
<P>
   We also have to endure Babbit's strident, off-putting depiction
of heterosexual sex, as the students try to simulate guy-girl
relationships. This is Babbit telling us that society has no
business trying to force homosexuals to be hetero, and it has all
the subtlety of an anvil dropped from a great height.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the trouble with much of the movie. By the end of it,
we're not so much enlightened as we are sore from being beaten over
the head.

NFL PRESEASON GAMES ARE HIGHWAY ROBBERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In the never-ending search for truth, justice
and a single legitimate reason for preseason NFL games, we bring
you these late-breaking developments Sunday night from Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman still wears No. 8 and can, indeed, overthrow Joey
Galloway and Rocket Ismail (and you said he couldn't do it).
</P>
<P>
   George Teague continues to happily deliver bone-crushing shots
to any exposed rib cage in his general vicinity. Check with Oakland
rookie wideout Marcus Knight _ assuming he's breathing again _ for
further details.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old girl broke the sound barrier singing the national
anthem (but she still didn't scream as loudly as Knight when Teague
hit him).
</P>
<P>
   It's safest to celebrate long interception returns ``after''
you're in the end zone, not before (look out behind you, Stephen
Fisher!).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, no lead is safe when the Cowboys' third-teamers are in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   An announced crowd of 56,878 paid upward of $61 a ticket to see
the Dallas Cowboys blow a 17-3 halftime lead and lose 21-20 when
the Raiders scored a touchdown and a 2-point conversion in the
game's final 68 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the meaningless details.
</P>
<P>
   If you were one of those fanning yourself with a program in the
Texas Stadium sauna Sunday night, crisis counselors are standing by
at our phone banks as we speak, ready to offer free psychological
counseling. Just dial 1-800-GET-A-LIFE.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you spent the better part of four hours watching
from the relative coolness of your air-conditioned living room,
don't act so smug. You missed a feisty John Wayne festival ('']Sons
of Katie Elder, Rio Lobo, Big Jake'') on TBS.
</P>
<P>
   I had to be there; it's my job. What's your excuse?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. In one of the biggest boondoggles in
sports history, Tex Schramm _ no, somewhat surprisingly it wasn't
Jerry Jones _ some years ago came up with the idea of tacking the
Cowboys' annual slate of preseason games onto the team's
season-ticket package. This forces fans who want to see legitimate
regular-season games to buy the preseason games, too.
</P>
<P>
   Master swindlers like Al Capone have landed in The Big House for
far less devious scams. Tex, instead, was ushered into the Hall of
Fame on the shoulders of joyous NFL owners, who still can't thank
him enough.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's your out. You just couldn't find anyone else stupid
enough to take the tickets off your hands.
</P>
<P>
   You get my drift. Preseason games _ even those with a
cliff-hanger ending like Sunday night's _ are about as useless as
cream gravy when the biscuits run out.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because there might not have been a single player on the
field in the fourth quarter who would actually be there under
similar circumstances during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a fortuitous pass interference penalty against the
Raiders and Fisher's should-have-been-a-touchdown interception and
62-yard return to the Oakland 4, Dallas' first-team offense scored
three times from the red zone and built a 17-3 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted (the first offensive unit) to get a more extended
period of time on the field because their opportunities have been
so limited so far,'' head coach Dave Campo said. ``Our plan was to
see those guys get 25 to 27 snaps and I think we got close to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Thank God we got their butts off the field before
anybody got seriously hurt (Rocket Ismail did leave with a sprained
thumb).
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively they moved the ball a little on us, even our first
unit, but we were able to come up with a few big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Wait'll I get those defensive linemen back in
Wichita Falls this week, I'll show 'em some heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying a lot of things, trying to get a look at
them on film, so everything we did probably didn't look as clean as
you would like,'' Aikman acknowledged. ``I did like us putting
points on the board with three possessions, especially with
touchdowns in the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: We were actually pretty damn sloppy but that pass
interference penalty saved our butts.
</P>
<P>
   The questionable flag on Charles Woodson defending against Wane
McGarrity on a pass that was likely uncatchable gave the Cowboys a
28-yard gift early in the second quarter and set up Chris Warren's
1-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later Fisher picked off an ill-advised Bobby Hoying
lob in the right flat and had such clear sailing to the end zone,
he started jabbing his right finger in the air as he crossed the
10, just before Oakland's Kenny Shedd ran him down from behind.
Michael Wiley, battling for the third running back spot behind
Emmitt Smith and Warren, found the end zone on a fourth-and-one
play.
</P>
<P>
   The pass interference penalty and interception were the two
biggest plays of the game right up until the Raiders' Scott
Dreisbach, listed fourth at quarterback on their depth chart, hit
Willie Tate in the end zone from the 15 with 1:08 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Dreisbach then found David Dunn open for the 2-point conversion,
sentencing the Cowboys to an 0-3 preseason start.
</P>
<P>
   Counting preseason wins or losses, though, is sort of like
counting sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it up and you're guaranteed to doze off. nn

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gore has always been a decent man
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The widely held notion that Al Gore hired on the overtly
religious Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate in order to
wash himself of scandal raises an awkward question. Dare we ask,
``What scandal?''
</P>
<P>
   Two matters are charged against the vice president's account,
neither amounting to a hill of beans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore phoned for political contributions from the White House
using a Democratic National Committee credit card. If that violated
the law against fund-rasing on government property _ and it
probably didn't _ the violation was purely technical. The law was
meant to prevent elected officials from shaking down government
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress use cell phones to hustle dollars from their
offices. The only distinction between that practice and Gore's was
that the vice president's phone was tethered. Scandal? Please.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger stink was been over the vice president's presence at
a Buddhist temple where money was harvested for the Clinton
re-election campaign. Gore knew the event was fund-related, but
there is no evidence he knew the contributions had been gimmicked
in a way that was illegal and would have to be returned, as they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president should have known better, but in a campaign
in which both parties grubbed shamelessly for money _ the Democrats
more grotesquely than the Republicans, though to lesser success _
Gore's sin was more of omission than commission.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. That's the whole Gore scandal record. For the rest,
he is being held guilty by association for the Clinton scandals,
and those _ wait a minute. When you think about it, even those are
blowing away like dark clouds in a high wind.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the president nor Hillary Clinton actually murdered
their friend Vincent Foster, put out a contract on him or even
muttered, ``Will not someone rid me of this troublesome fellow?''
</P>
<P>
   The firing of the White House travel staff in the blundering
first days of the administration was politically bollixed but it
wasn't illegal, and the special prosecutor could find nothing worse
than ordinary political spin in the First Lady's testimony about
her role in it.
</P>
<P>
   To little notice _ page 28 in the New York Times and many papers
skipped it altogether _ the independent counsel recently concluded
that, for all the hollering otherwise, the appearance in White
House computers of FBI files on, among others, some prominent
Republicans was only a bureaucratic snafu, innocent of partisan
purpose or consequence _ just as the administration has been saying
all along.
</P>
<P>
   We're still to hear the last word on Whitewater _ remember
Whitewater? _ but as time has gone on, that supposed scandal has
looked more like a miasma of confusing piffle than like anything
worse. We'll see, but in any event Gore wasn't anywhere around it.
Nor he was never within even air-kiss range of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman aside, Al Gore, a life-long straight arrow and solid
family man, cleans up nicely all on his own.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 13, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GORE-IMAGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ No matter whether you think Al
Gore should be the next president, give him this much: He has
transformed the vice presidency, the subject of generations of
ridicule and derision, into more than the butt of jokes. So it is
remarkable that Gore's political coming-out here next week has been
designed not merely as the usual four-day paean to the party's new
standard bearer but also as a production that will obscure, neglect
and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square Office,''
only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor to the Oval Office.
By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ron Wyden, a Jew whose parents fled
Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator from Oregon, a state in
which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population.
Oregon is also home to not a few militia members and
black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet Wyden says he has
encountered only a ``small hard core'' of anti-Semitic haters. The
tale of Wyden in Oregon bears retelling for those who reacted to
the news of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's anointing with the queasy
suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Although
bigotry thrives and shouts rather loud, Jews in this country have
never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews
are no longer considered ``the other'' in America. By Laurie
Goodstein. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Darwin is back in Kansas.
In the state school board primary this month, Kansas voters
defeated those candidates who last year supported removing any
mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. Now,
whoever wins in November is expected to restore evolution to the
curriculum and reverse a significant victory for advocates of
creationism. By Pam Belluck. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-HASSLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Business travelers have been
grousing for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or
at all), lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes
and a tote board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Air
travel, once considered pleasant and even glamorous, is now
routinely derided as something akin to riding a Greyhound with
wings, except the bus has more comfortable seats and usually gets
there on time. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once it was the great taboo. Now,
most American schools and policy-makers are talking about it: the
achievement gap between black and Hispanic students on the one hand
and whites and Asians on the other, which persists even among the
ranks of the most well off and well educated. Fourteen racially
diverse suburbs in different parts of the country have joined to
share successful strategies for closing the gap. As a way of
forcing them to deal with it, states are beginning to require
school districts to break out their test score data by race. By
Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   SINATRA-WWII-REVIEW (New York) _ Some in Times Square aren't
thrilled by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of
Frank Sinatra on the traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway.
Critics say the Crossroads of the World are too congested for the
bronze likeness of a singer with little connection to Broadway. The
most historically significant aspect of this proposal, however, has
been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed forces' busiest
recruiting station would honor a man who avoided the World War II
draft and spent much of his life trying to live it down. By Tom
Kuntz.
</P>

   GUN-LAWS-REVIEW (Boston) _ ``We must help protect our children,
in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our
nation's gun laws,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. In
other words, Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the
job. This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control
the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side long
supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National
Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American
freedom. But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed
by guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at a
cost estimated as high as $100 billion. Are current laws adequate
to to fight this scourge? By Fox Butterfield.

   THEATERS-ORNATE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Marcus Loew, who founded
Loews Theaters in the early 1900s, once said: ``We sell tickets to
theaters, not movies.'' That was certainly the case when the grand
movie palaces of the teens and twenties lit up America's big cities
and small towns. For the most part, the theaters were baroque,
showy grand dames. Some flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, and architectural ornamentation worthy of the Sun King.
Now, a new grandiosity is back, inflating cinemas into
Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as many as 30 screens. Many
theaters now compete with their film selections in terms of
theatricality. By Monte Williams.

   XGAMES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ The 2000 X Games, in which some
450 athletes from 23 countries participate in such once-renegade
``extreme'' sports as dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line
skating, street luge and sky-surfing, are spawning some extreme

<P>
   &UR; LONG REMEMBER &LR;  By MacKinlay Kantor. (Forge/Tom Doherty,
$14.95.) In this Civil War novel, Kantor tells the story of a man
who tries to live as a pacifist in, of all places, Gettysburg, Pa.,
but is inexorably drawn into the fighting. This is ``a very fine
book,'' Peter Monro Jack wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1934, ``a novel that tastes and smells of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The war's Washington front is examined in  &UR; ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A
Press Portrait &LR; , edited by Herbert Mitgang (Fordham University,
$19.95). The anthology, with a new introduction, draws on more than
100 newspapers and periodicals from the United States and Europe.
Lincoln was a devoted reader of newspapers at a time when they had
little pretense of objectivity. The passages ``illuminate as only
contemporary writings can,'' Gerald Carson wrote in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEARTS IN ATLANTIS &LR;  By Stephen King. (Pocket Books, $7.99.)
This sprawling work _ two novellas, two short stories and an
epilogue _ is permeated by Vietnam and the survivor guilt among
those who did not go. ``We know now what Stephen King, the master
of horror, is afraid of,'' Caleb Crain wrote last year, even
though, he added, the war itself ``remains offstage.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIME, LOVE, MEMORY: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the
Origins of Behavior &LR;  By Jonathan Weiner. (Vintage, $14.) From his
study of the humble fruit fly, Seymour Benzer has achieved great
insights into the connections between DNA and behavior, both insect
and human. This is ``a lovely book about a lovely scientist'' and
``a wonderful description of biologists at work together,'' Lewis
Wolpert said in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad &LR; 
By David Haward Bain. (Penguin, $18.) The legendary golden spike
was an ordinary iron one, according to this definitive history.
From the drawing rooms of magnates like Leland Stanford to the
``hell on wheels'' where laborers binged, Bain brings an epic
project to life. ``The building of the Pacific railroad,'' Robert
M. Utley wrote last year, has never been recounted ``so thoroughly,
authoritatively and engagingly.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT &LR;  By Bill Pronzini. (Walker, $8.95.) In
this noir suspense thriller set in northern California, two men are
caught together in raging flood waters. One is a vintner tormented
by a childhood horror; the other is a trucker obsessed with finding
the hit-and-run driver who left his wife in a coma. ``It's a dark
and twisty road to the big smashup,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote in 1999,
``but these characters travel well.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SISTER WOLF &LR;  By Ann Arensberg. (Ballantine, $14.) A daughter of
a noble Hungarian family lives alone on 1,000 acres in the
Berkshires, which she has turned into a sanctuary for wild animals.
``This is a first novel of striking originality,'' Ella Leffland
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1980, calling it
``crisp, urbane, alive with wit.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PRODUCTIVE EDGE: A New Strategy for Economic Growth &LR;  By
Richard K. Lester. (Norton, $16.95.) The United States' standard of
living depends on authentic gains in productivity, and the nation
has much more to do to get its economy back on track, according to
this analysis by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The book is ``a necessary corrective to all this
economic triumphalism,'' Jeff Madrick wrote in 1998, praising its
``cogent ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I COULD TELL YOU STORIES: Sojourns in the Land of Memory &LR;  By
Patricia Hampl. (Norton, $13.) This collection of essays explores
the art of memoir, as the author moves back and forth between a
series of recollections and accounts of reading others' memoirs.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1999, Linda Simon
called Hampl's prose ``rich and idiosyncratic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOY IN THE WATER &LR;  By Stephen Dobyns. (St. Martin's, $6.99.) In
Dobyns' 20th novel, the headmaster of a failing New Hampshire
boarding school investigates a murder on campus. ``His prose is
fluent and the plot races along like clockwork,'' Erik Burns wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE THE MOVIE: How Entertainment Conquered Reality &LR; , by Neal
Gabler. (Vintage, $14.) A cultural critic sees events like the O.J.
Simpson trial and the death of Diana, princess of Wales, as
national obsessions that overshadow ideas and ideology. Gabler
``has a fine old time showing how entertainment values have come to
permeate every nook and cranny of American life,'' Peter Biskind
wrote last year. ``It is impossible to put down this book
unconvinced of the cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of
American life.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 13, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GORE-IMAGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ No matter whether you think Al
Gore should be the next president, give him this much: He has
transformed the vice presidency, the subject of generations of
ridicule and derision, into more than the butt of jokes. So it is
remarkable that Gore's political coming-out here next week has been
designed not merely as the usual four-day paean to the party's new
standard bearer but also as a production that will obscure, neglect
and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square Office,''
only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor to the Oval Office.
By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ron Wyden, a Jew whose parents fled
Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator from Oregon, a state in
which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population.
Oregon is also home to not a few militia members and
black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet Wyden says he has
encountered only a ``small hard core'' of anti-Semitic haters. The
tale of Wyden in Oregon bears retelling for those who reacted to
the news of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's anointing with the queasy
suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Although
bigotry thrives and shouts rather loud, Jews in this country have
never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews
are no longer considered ``the other'' in America. By Laurie
Goodstein. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Darwin is back in Kansas.
In the state school board primary this month, Kansas voters
defeated those candidates who last year supported removing any
mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. Now,
whoever wins in November is expected to restore evolution to the
curriculum and reverse a significant victory for advocates of
creationism. By Pam Belluck. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-HASSLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Business travelers have been
grousing for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or
at all), lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes
and a tote board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Air
travel, once considered pleasant and even glamorous, is now
routinely derided as something akin to riding a Greyhound with
wings, except the bus has more comfortable seats and usually gets
there on time. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once it was the great taboo. Now,
most American schools and policy-makers are talking about it: the
achievement gap between black and Hispanic students on the one hand
and whites and Asians on the other, which persists even among the
ranks of the most well off and well educated. Fourteen racially
diverse suburbs in different parts of the country have joined to
share successful strategies for closing the gap. As a way of
forcing them to deal with it, states are beginning to require
school districts to break out their test score data by race. By
Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   SINATRA-WWII-REVIEW (New York) _ Some in Times Square aren't
thrilled by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of
Frank Sinatra on the traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway.
Critics say the Crossroads of the World are too congested for the
bronze likeness of a singer with little connection to Broadway. The
most historically significant aspect of this proposal, however, has
been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed forces' busiest
recruiting station would honor a man who avoided the World War II
draft and spent much of his life trying to live it down. By Tom
Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-LAWS-REVIEW (Boston) _ ``We must help protect our children,
in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our
nation's gun laws,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. In

by guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at a
cost estimated as high as $100 billion. Are current laws adequate

FROM CHILE'S ARMY, LITTLE BUT THE SOUND OF FURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chilean soldiers still march to the tune of
the stern martial music _ the Badenweiler, Nibelung and Ferbelin _
that the Prussians brought with them in 1885 when Chile invited
them to modernize its army. The soldiers' medals, uniforms and
goose-stepping also evoke that era, making the force appear
profoundly anachronistic, even in a nation as tradition-bound as
this one.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the misfit was only superficial. Even a
decade ago, Chile's armed forces still had a powerful grip on the
country, overseeing not only its defense, but also its economic and
political affairs. A law unto themselves, they rousted dissidents
from their beds and tortured and executed them at will.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, they are losing their commanding position in
Chilean society. That became strikingly evident last week, as Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, their former leader, was stripped of his
senatorial immunity by the Supreme Court, clearing the way for his
probable arrest and trial. In response, all the top military
commanders could do was grumble, publicly and bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces and especially the army are politically
isolated,'' said Raul Sohr, a sociologist and student of military
affairs here. ``The correlation of forces have simply shifted
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The political role of the military is diminishing little by
little,'' said Francisco Javier Cuadra, a lawyer who was General
Pinochet's chief of staff between 1984 and 1987. ``And as Pinochet
leaves the stage, its profile will diminish even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Two major events created the slope the military is sliding down,
which is all the more noteworthy because old authoritarian habits
are returning in neighboring Peru and some other South American
countries.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, was the arrest of Pinochet in London two years
ago on a Spanish warrant charging him with gross violations of
human rights, including kidnapping, murder and torture. The arrest
encouraged a rush of attention to human rights abuses in this
usually closed society and emboldened prosecuting judges to
investigate and charge scores of retired and acting police and
military officers. When the prosecutions began, the general was not
around to quash them. The military's accustomed impunity began to
erode.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Chilean government, pressing for General Pinochet's
return, argued that he should face Chilean rather than Spanish
justice as a matter of sovereignty, and the military _ which does
not want him to face any trial at all _ went along. Since March,
when the general returned to Chile after the British released him
on humanitarian grounds, he has been too weak to block the
prosecutions of fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial event was Chile's election of Ricardo Lagos in
January as the first Socialist president since 1973, when Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende with the help of the Nixon
administration. In his first months in power, Lagos has pushed
forward the economic deregulation policies first pioneered by
Pinochet and eliminated capital restrictions loathed by Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   With Marxism no longer a problem, the United States, which
strongly supported the Pinochet coup, is now strongly backing
civilian rule. Domestic fears of communism have faded, too,
removing the armed forces' chief argument for one of the largest
per capita military budgets in Latin America. Chile's business
community, while maintaining support for Pinochet, has drawn back
from pushing the military to intervene to protect him, because they
know such turbulence would deter international credit, investment
and trade as the country emerges from a recession.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor is simply the passage of time. Commanders have
rotated, and the most senior of the Pinochet era have retired.
Younger officers remain devoted to Pinochet, but most focus on
relations with the politicians who hold the purse strings for the
new frigates, fighter jets and tanks they say they desperately
need.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a new generation on the Supreme Court (only three of
20 justices remain from Pinochet's time) has ruled that cases of
missing people can be treated as kidnappings. Until a body is
produced, a kidnapping case is considered open. The approach has
opened a multitude of cases that had been shut by a 1978 amnesty
for political crimes _ including killings _ decreed under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed the armed forces to the negotiating table with human
rights lawyers and led to top officers' signing a document in June
that promised their assistance in finding the bodies of the
missing, in exchange for testifying in private and receiving
immunity. The agreement was the first time the military
acknowledged that members of the security forces had played a role
in the wrongful death of anybody and the first time it publicly
retreated from old rebuttals that either the disappeared had been
killed in civil conflicts or that they were not dead at all, but
had merely left the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great advance,'' said Mario Fernandez Baeza, Lagos'
defense minister. ``Only two years ago, a large sector of the
society, including the armed forces in a quiet way, justified those
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with even its border disputes with Peru and Argentina
settled over the last three years, the military is trying to learn
to live without enemies. That may mean living with new masters.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has begun negotiations with conservative lawmakers to
change the constitution written during the Pinochet era, which
gives the military special powers, including wide-ranging autonomy
and representation in the Senate. He has also been forthright about
claiming his superiority over the armed forces, on several
occasions publicly scolding military chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   After Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, the army chief, defiantly told
reporters he needed no one's permission to visit Pinochet after
last week's ruling, Lagos observed, sharply: ``The command of our
country rests on what I decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently such a clash would have sent shudders through
Chile. But Izurieta has learned to balance his relations with two
civilian presidents and hard-liners within the armed forces unhappy
that he has not better defended Pinochet. After his words of
defiance, he immediately reiterated the military's promise to seek
the whereabouts of the missing. Lagos, for his part, said he did
not mind that Izurieta and other commanders made a courtesy visit
to their old leader.

FROM CHILE'S ARMY, LITTLE BUT THE SOUND OF FURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chilean soldiers still march to the tune of
the stern martial music _ the Badenweiler, Nibelung and Ferbelin _
that the Prussians brought with them in 1885 when Chile invited
them to modernize its army. The soldiers' medals, uniforms and
goose-stepping also evoke that era, making the force appear
profoundly anachronistic, even in a nation as tradition-bound as
this one.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the misfit was only superficial. Even a
decade ago, Chile's armed forces still had a powerful grip on the
country, overseeing not only its defense, but also its economic and
political affairs. A law unto themselves, they rousted dissidents
from their beds and tortured and executed them at will.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, they are losing their commanding position in
Chilean society. That became strikingly evident last week, as Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, their former leader, was stripped of his
senatorial immunity by the Supreme Court, clearing the way for his
probable arrest and trial. In response, all the top military
commanders could do was grumble, publicly and bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces and especially the army are politically
isolated,'' said Raul Sohr, a sociologist and student of military
affairs here. ``The correlation of forces have simply shifted
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The political role of the military is diminishing little by
little,'' said Francisco Javier Cuadra, a lawyer who was General
Pinochet's chief of staff between 1984 and 1987. ``And as Pinochet
leaves the stage, its profile will diminish even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Two major events created the slope the military is sliding down,
which is all the more noteworthy because old authoritarian habits
are returning in neighboring Peru and some other South American
countries.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, was the arrest of Pinochet in London two years
ago on a Spanish warrant charging him with gross violations of
human rights, including kidnapping, murder and torture. The arrest
encouraged a rush of attention to human rights abuses in this
usually closed society and emboldened prosecuting judges to
investigate and charge scores of retired and acting police and
military officers. When the prosecutions began, the general was not
around to quash them. The military's accustomed impunity began to
erode.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Chilean government, pressing for General Pinochet's
return, argued that he should face Chilean rather than Spanish
justice as a matter of sovereignty, and the military _ which does
not want him to face any trial at all _ went along. Since March,
when the general returned to Chile after the British released him
on humanitarian grounds, he has been too weak to block the
prosecutions of fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial event was Chile's election of Ricardo Lagos in
January as the first Socialist president since 1973, when Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende with the help of the Nixon
administration. In his first months in power, Lagos has pushed
forward the economic deregulation policies first pioneered by
Pinochet and eliminated capital restrictions loathed by Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   With Marxism no longer a problem, the United States, which
strongly supported the Pinochet coup, is now strongly backing
civilian rule. Domestic fears of communism have faded, too,
removing the armed forces' chief argument for one of the largest
per capita military budgets in Latin America. Chile's business
community, while maintaining support for Pinochet, has drawn back
from pushing the military to intervene to protect him, because they
know such turbulence would deter international credit, investment
and trade as the country emerges from a recession.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor is simply the passage of time. Commanders have
rotated, and the most senior of the Pinochet era have retired.
Younger officers remain devoted to Pinochet, but most focus on
relations with the politicians who hold the purse strings for the
new frigates, fighter jets and tanks they say they desperately
need.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a new generation on the Supreme Court (only three of
20 justices remain from Pinochet's time) has ruled that cases of
missing people can be treated as kidnappings. Until a body is
produced, a kidnapping case is considered open. The approach has
opened a multitude of cases that had been shut by a 1978 amnesty
for political crimes _ including killings _ decreed under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed the armed forces to the negotiating table with human
rights lawyers and led to top officers' signing a document in June
that promised their assistance in finding the bodies of the
missing, in exchange for testifying in private and receiving
immunity. The agreement was the first time the military
acknowledged that members of the security forces had played a role
in the wrongful death of anybody and the first time it publicly
retreated from old rebuttals that either the disappeared had been
killed in civil conflicts or that they were not dead at all, but
had merely left the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great advance,'' said Mario Fernandez Baeza, Lagos'
defense minister. ``Only two years ago, a large sector of the
society, including the armed forces in a quiet way, justified those
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with even its border disputes with Peru and Argentina
settled over the last three years, the military is trying to learn
to live without enemies. That may mean living with new masters.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has begun negotiations with conservative lawmakers to
change the constitution written during the Pinochet era, which
gives the military special powers, including wide-ranging autonomy
and representation in the Senate. He has also been forthright about
claiming his superiority over the armed forces, on several
occasions publicly scolding military chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   After Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, the army chief, defiantly told
reporters he needed no one's permission to visit Pinochet after
last week's ruling, Lagos observed, sharply: ``The command of our
country rests on what I decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently such a clash would have sent shudders through
Chile. But Izurieta has learned to balance his relations with two
civilian presidents and hard-liners within the armed forces unhappy
that he has not better defended Pinochet. After his words of
defiance, he immediately reiterated the military's promise to seek
the whereabouts of the missing. Lagos, for his part, said he did
not mind that Izurieta and other commanders made a courtesy visit
to their old leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely regulated conflict,'' said Cuadra, the
former Pinochet aide. ``It's political theater with both Lagos and
Izurieta each playing a role and each knowing the other's lines in
the libretto.''

THE ART OF THE GRAND OLD CINEMAS, THE SCIENCE OF THE NEW

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcus Loew, who founded Loews Theaters in the early
1900s, once said: ``We sell tickets to theaters, not movies.'' That
was certainly the case when the grand movie palaces of the 1910s,
'20s and '30s lit up America.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the theaters were showy grandes dames. They
flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble floors and architectural
ornamentation worthy of the Sun King. The Loews Paradise in Fordham
in the Bronx was beyond rococo, festooned with statues, elaborate
archways and intricate frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   By the '40s, the golden age of movie palaces was falling into a
decline that, in the '70s, the mall-driven rise of the multiplex
began to counter, only for it to be clobbered again by the VCR
craze.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, a new grandiosity has arrived,
inflating cinemas into Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as
many as 30 screens, the theaters competing with their film
selections in terms of theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   AMC, the national movie chain formerly known as American
Multi-Cinema, has built 11 30-screen theaters in six cities,
including Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit, Dallas and
Houston. On West 42nd Street in Manhattan, it has erected the AMC
Empire 25, which, as its name suggests, has a mere 25 screens.
There are also four roof decks _ a sublime amenity for stargazers,
sun addicts and smokers. Those who want an unencumbered view of
Manhattan's skyline can choose to look from outdoors or indoors,
thanks to vast banks of windows. At one of six concession stands,
there is cafe seating and several television monitors, which show
coming attractions as well as interviews with luminaries on Cable
News Network. There is also a VIP room for celebrities who don't
want to mingle with hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is a Loews, with a ceiling fresco in the lobby
and wall murals meant to hark back to the likes of the Paradise.
This cinematic emporium has 13 screens, TV sets at the concession
stands and, like AMC, several talking machines where moviegoers can
purchase tickets. It also has a restaurant that supplies the
concession stands with more than the usual movie fare, reflecting
the fact that more profits are made there than on ticket sales. On
the menu are mini mozzarella sticks ($5.99), chicken quesadillas
($5.99), potato skins ($6.99) and popcorn shrimp ($7.99).
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners pin this bigger-is-better, more-is-more ethos
squarely on the synergy of the booming economy and changing
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good,'' said Rick King, a spokesman for AMC.
``People have more disposable income.'' And those people, he said,
include baby boomers who have become empty nesters, and
big-spending teen-agers and young adults, who are savvy and
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's teen-ager and young adult movie-goers have higher
expectations in a technical sense,'' King said, ``for sound and
picture quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The cinemas reflect the shift. ``We've returned our attention to
film presentation and showmanship in our buildings,'' said Marc
Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews. ``The consumer is a lot more savvy
about the presentation. Entertainment has become news.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, every possible technological advance is being
incorporated: digital sound, bigger screens and stadium seating,
where everyone is on a riser.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happens is, the moviegoing experience is more powerful
and more consuming,'' Pascucci said. ``What we've found is that
instead of going to an ordinary theater in the neighborhood, people
will go to a theater one or more miles away if it's splashier.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all that focus, the new grandiosity holds little
resemblance to the old. What technology gives now, atmosphere
offered then.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Jones, a senior associate at Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer
Associates, a Manhattan-based architectural firm, said the old
movie palaces, with their mixing of Baroque, Italian Renaissance,
Classical and Moorish themes, were meant for fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were going to a different period of time,'' he said.
``They were taking you to a different place. You were
transported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's analogy,'' he said, ``is: buy a plane ticket, go down
to Disney World and end up in the Magic Kingdom. It's the wonderful
world of movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The megaplexing trend appears to be going as global as the taste
for American movies. Loews, which has 245 movie locations in 22
American cities, also has cinemas in Canada, Spain, Hungary and
Turkey. And it has plans to build in Italy and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet the new style in megamultiplexing will last as
long as the economy rides high _ or until some unforeseen social
development steals its audience. The grand old movie palaces _ all
set in urban centers _ died out less from the Depression than from
housing patterns that sucked city populations into new suburbs
after World War II, according to Toby Miller, a professor of cinema
studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The televisualization and suburbanization of American homes
denuded the inner city of its population,'' he said. Modest cinemas
became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another area of vulnerability. Bigger is only better
until it isn't. Years ago, there was a monopoly-busting Justice
Department decree that forced major movie studios, which used to
control distribution, production and exhibition, to sell off the
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   At AMC Empire 25 last week, the backlash against big was more
personal. Yoland Trevino, who is from Los Angeles, said she felt
like ``a rat in a maze'' trying to find a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no signs visible from here,'' she said, looking
around in the lobby. ``It's like sensory overload. I'm
overwhelmed.''

ADDING HOURS ON THE GROUND TO HOURS IN THE SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Petersen, who expects to fly about 250,000 miles this
year, was on the phone from the Atlanta airport on Thursday, making
a weary concession during this summer of the worst airline delays
and cancellations ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees always kidded me that I was the Teflon flier,''
said the formerly indefatigable Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer
magazine, a monthly for frequent fliers. ``In all the air travel I
do, I've really had very few problems. But I have to say, &UR; man &LR; , the
airlines finally got me this summer. I am no longer the Teflon
flier. I've been spending way too many nights in airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen now joins the business travelers who have been grousing
for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or at all),
lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes and a tote
board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Among
Petersen's peripatetic peers, air travel, once considered pleasant
and even glamorous, is now routinely derided as something akin to
riding a Greyhound with wings, except the bus has more comfortable
seats and usually gets there on time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the peak of the summer travel season, tens of millions
of American leisure travelers, many of whom fly only once or twice
a year, are beginning to see what the sky warriors have been
griping about. Again and again this summer, their vacation plans
have been encountering the gridlock staggering the air traffic
system. Airports, which once put an optimistic bounce in a
traveler's step, are of late regarded as places that ought to have
signs over the doors: Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here.
</P>
<P>
   Recent numbers underscore the grim situation. With 48,448
delayed flights, June was the worst month ever for airline on-time
performance. The Federal Aviation Administration announced last
week that there were 44,401 delays in July _ about the same number
as in July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To see how things have worsened, compare that to July of 1998,
when there were only 25,672 delays. Also, the current delay figures
do not reflect many thousands of flights that have been canceled by
airlines. For example, United Airlines, locked in a labor dispute
with pilots who are refusing some overtime shifts, lopped 4,800
flights from its summer schedule and canceled more than 1,000
flights last week alone. United has also cut 4,000 flights from its
September and October schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Simple math partly explains the air travel crisis. The number of
airline passengers has doubled since 1980. About 640 million people
will board 7.4 million domestic flights this year, the FAA says.
Obviously, scheduling more flights subjects more planes to bad
weather, which the agency says causes 70 percent of all delays. But
there are other contributing factors. Some critics say the airlines
strain the system by scheduling most flights during the same hours
in the mornings and afternoons. And some conservative critics claim
the FAA, despite huge spending for new air traffic control
technology, is an inept bureaucracy that should be replaced with a
privately owned air control organization. Others say that the
airline industry is simply rapacious, monopolistic and determined
to reduce service and boost the bottom line on the backs of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone still recall the glamour of air travel?'' asked
Rene Foss, who began working as a flight attendant in 1985 because
her mother had been one in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl, my mother used to tell me about her
days as a stewardess,'' she said. ``They wore white gloves. They
served lobster thermidor. They had to practice what was called the
art of polite conversation with one another, so they could better
communicate with sophisticated passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could only imagine my surprise when I started flying,''
she added, laughing. ``Now, instead of wearing white gloves, we're
wearing rubber gloves. Instead of learning to practice the art of
polite conversation, we're learning to practice the art of
self-defense against air rage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the times that Foss in her nonflying hours wrote
and performs in ``Around the World in a Bad Mood,'' a musical
comedy about beleaguered flight attendants and clueless passengers.
The cabaretlike show, which taps into America's air travel angst,
sold out early this month at the Fringe Festival in Minneapolis and
is scheduled for four performances next month in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Misery being the mother of humor, other travel experts also find
occasional amusement in the steady decline in the quality of the
airline experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen one carrier that's actually cutting down on the size
of the pretzel bags they give out,'' said C.Thomas Nulty, the
president of Navigant International Inc., a travel management
company in Englewood, Colo. ``A small bag of pretzels is now half a
small bag. I'm not sure where you can even buy a bag of pretzels
that small,'' said Nulty, who estimated that he flies about 120,000
miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nulty said airline consolidation often results in more
convenient routes. But he and other veteran travelers worry about
the potential for further deterioration in passenger service as big
airlines continue to swallow smaller ones. For example, the largest
carrier, United, has announced a deal, currently being reviewed by
the Justice Department, to buy USAirways. And American Airlines is
in talks to buy Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, for one, is not hopeful that things will improve any
time soon. The airlines, many of which are enjoying record revenues
as planes take off nearly full in this soaring economy, have no
real incentive to do more than pay lip service to customer
complaints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customer complacency is partly to blame, Petersen said. Last
year, after a summer of airline delays and worsening service,
Congress was weighing legislation that would have mandated fines
for airline delays, lost baggage and other problems. Instead, under
lobbying pressure from the industry, Congress allowed the airlines
to adopt a voluntary set of customer complaint guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business and leisure travelers alike didn't communicate to our
elected officials that we wanted real action,'' Petersen said.
``Instead of having to adhere to a law with teeth in it, airlines
now mollify aggrieved passengers by saying, `Well, how about we
give you a thousand bonus miles and a voucher for Taco Bell? Will
you be OK with that?'''

ADDING HOURS ON THE GROUND TO HOURS IN THE SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Petersen, who expects to fly about 250,000 miles this
year, was on the phone from the Atlanta airport on Thursday, making
a weary concession during this summer of the worst airline delays
and cancellations ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees always kidded me that I was the Teflon flier,''
said the formerly indefatigable Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer
magazine, a monthly for frequent fliers. ``In all the air travel I
do, I've really had very few problems. But I have to say, &UR; man &LR; , the
airlines finally got me this summer. I am no longer the Teflon
flier. I've been spending way too many nights in airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen now joins the business travelers who have been grousing
for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or at all),
lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes and a tote
board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Among
Petersen's peripatetic peers, air travel, once considered pleasant
and even glamorous, is now routinely derided as something akin to
riding a Greyhound with wings, except the bus has more comfortable
seats and usually gets there on time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the peak of the summer travel season, tens of millions
of American leisure travelers, many of whom fly only once or twice
a year, are beginning to see what the sky warriors have been
griping about. Again and again this summer, their vacation plans
have been encountering the gridlock staggering the air traffic
system. Airports, which once put an optimistic bounce in a
traveler's step, are of late regarded as places that ought to have
signs over the doors: Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here.
</P>
<P>
   Recent numbers underscore the grim situation. With 48,448
delayed flights, June was the worst month ever for airline on-time
performance. The Federal Aviation Administration announced last
week that there were 44,401 delays in July _ about the same number
as in July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To see how things have worsened, compare that to July of 1998,
when there were only 25,672 delays. Also, the current delay figures
do not reflect many thousands of flights that have been canceled by
airlines. For example, United Airlines, locked in a labor dispute
with pilots who are refusing some overtime shifts, lopped 4,800
flights from its summer schedule and canceled more than 1,000
flights last week alone. United has also cut 4,000 flights from its
September and October schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Simple math partly explains the air travel crisis. The number of
airline passengers has doubled since 1980. About 640 million people
will board 7.4 million domestic flights this year, the FAA says.
Obviously, scheduling more flights subjects more planes to bad
weather, which the agency says causes 70 percent of all delays. But
there are other contributing factors. Some critics say the airlines
strain the system by scheduling most flights during the same hours
in the mornings and afternoons. And some conservative critics claim
the FAA, despite huge spending for new air traffic control
technology, is an inept bureaucracy that should be replaced with a
privately owned air control organization. Others say that the
airline industry is simply rapacious, monopolistic and determined
to reduce service and boost the bottom line on the backs of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone still recall the glamour of air travel?'' asked
Rene Foss, who began working as a flight attendant in 1985 because
her mother had been one in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl, my mother used to tell me about her
days as a stewardess,'' she said. ``They wore white gloves. They
served lobster thermidor. They had to practice what was called the
art of polite conversation with one another, so they could better
communicate with sophisticated passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could only imagine my surprise when I started flying,''
she added, laughing. ``Now, instead of wearing white gloves, we're
wearing rubber gloves. Instead of learning to practice the art of
polite conversation, we're learning to practice the art of
self-defense against air rage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the times that Foss in her nonflying hours wrote
and performs in ``Around the World in a Bad Mood,'' a musical
comedy about beleaguered flight attendants and clueless passengers.
The cabaretlike show, which taps into America's air travel angst,
sold out early this month at the Fringe Festival in Minneapolis and
is scheduled for four performances next month in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Misery being the mother of humor, other travel experts also find
occasional amusement in the steady decline in the quality of the
airline experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen one carrier that's actually cutting down on the size
of the pretzel bags they give out,'' said C.Thomas Nulty, the
president of Navigant International Inc., a travel management
company in Englewood, Colo. ``A small bag of pretzels is now half a
small bag. I'm not sure where you can even buy a bag of pretzels
that small,'' said Nulty, who estimated that he flies about 120,000
miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nulty said airline consolidation often results in more
convenient routes. But he and other veteran travelers worry about
the potential for further deterioration in passenger service as big
airlines continue to swallow smaller ones. For example, the largest
carrier, United, has announced a deal, currently being reviewed by
the Justice Department, to buy USAirways. And American Airlines is
in talks to buy Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, for one, is not hopeful that things will improve any
time soon. The airlines, many of which are enjoying record revenues
as planes take off nearly full in this soaring economy, have no
real incentive to do more than pay lip service to customer
complaints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customer complacency is partly to blame, Petersen said. Last
year, after a summer of airline delays and worsening service,
Congress was weighing legislation that would have mandated fines
for airline delays, lost baggage and other problems. Instead, under
lobbying pressure from the industry, Congress allowed the airlines
to adopt a voluntary set of customer complaint guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business and leisure travelers alike didn't communicate to our
elected officials that we wanted real action,'' Petersen said.
``Instead of having to adhere to a law with teeth in it, airlines
now mollify aggrieved passengers by saying, `Well, how about we
give you a thousand bonus miles and a voucher for Taco Bell? Will
you be OK with that?'''

   NEW YORK _ Some in Times Square aren't thrilled by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of Frank Sinatra on the traffic
island at 44th Street and Broadway. Critics say the Crossroads of
the World is too congested for the bronze likeness of a singer with
little connection to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The most historically significant aspect of this proposal,
however, has been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed
forces' busiest recruiting station would honor a man who avoided
the World War II draft and spent much of his life trying to live it
down.
</P>
<P>
   As the historian William Manchester once noted, Sinatra was
``the most hated man of World War II'' because he was getting rich
thrilling American women while their boyfriends and husbands were
fighting overseas. In fact, the site proposed for the 10-foot-tall
statue is almost exactly where in 1944, sailors (captured in a
famous photo) threw tomatoes at the crooner's visage on the
now-defunct Paramount Theater across the street from the recruiting
station, which opened in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra and his family always claimed that he wanted to serve,
but was stopped by a punctured eardrum. It's true that his
exemption was legitimate. But his claim is put to the test by
records of an FBI inquiry into his exemption released after his
death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra repeatedly said on draft forms that he had ``no physical
or mental defects or diseases,'' as he wrote on one. But when he
arrived at the Jersey City, N.J., induction office in December
1943, he gave Army doctors plenty of reasons to reject him. He told
them that an ear injury at birth and subsequent operations were
still causing ``running ear'' and ``head noises.'' Furthermore, he
claimed to be ``neurotic, afraid to be in crowds, afraid to go in
elevator, ((wants)) to run when surrounded by people'' and had
``been very nervous for four or five years.'' He also complained
that he ``wakens tired in the a.m., is run down and
undernourished.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors didn't question the implausibility of such a
celebrity being crowd-averse. Instead, they verified that he had a
punctured left eardrum and declared him 4F. (The conservative
columnist Westbrook Pegler dubbed him ``bugle-deaf Frankie boy.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for his other claims, Army doctors concluded he was ``not
acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint.'' But they
downplayed this in their official report. A subsequent inquiry
noted that ``inasmuch as the selectee was to be rejected on an
organic basis'' _ the eardrum _ ``the diagnosis of psychoneurosis,
severe was not added to the list. Notation of emotional instability
was made instead ((to)) avoid undue unpleasantness for both the
selectee and the induction service.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI investigated as a result of an anonymous tip (passed on
by the columnist Walter Winchell) that Sinatra bribed his way out
of the draft. Agents turned up no evidence of that. But what the
FBI did find puts the statue debate in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra spent much of the rest of his life trying to compensate
for not serving. He entertained U.S. troops in Italy at the end of
the war. He recorded special disks just for the GIs on the front
lines. And he tried to entertain the boys in Korea, too, but the
Army refused to give him a security clearance, suspicious that he
might be a communist (which, it turned out, he wasn't).
</P>
<P>
   In a way, a statue on that spot would be more than an honor for
Sinatra. It would be a vindication.

<P>
   There are now official surveys to confirm that tourists are
taking over New York City.
</P>
<P>
   With a population approaching 9 million, the city played host to
about four tourists per resident last year, according to federal
surveys and tourist research announced by city officials last week.
The figures pushed New York up into second place for tourist
destinations in the United States, bested only by Orlando, Fla.,
home of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New York City's 36.7 million visitors came from within
the United States, but foreigners made up about 20 percent of the
total. Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and France had the honor of
providing the largest numbers of New York City's 6.6 million
international visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they know where to go? What do they expect of the
strange and fearsome New Yorker? What is considered surprising and
noteworthy?
</P>
<P>
   The questions are all the more interesting because the answers,
as found in excerpts from foreign guidebooks, reveal as much about
the culture the travelers are coming from as the one they intend to
gawk at.
</P>
<P>
   And they also demonstrate, as many New Yorkers can testify, that
no one has warned tourists not to come to a dead stop on Times
Square's sidewalks at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ANDREA KANNAPELL
</P>
<P>
   Japan
</P>
<P>
   From ``Chikyu no Aruki-kata (How to Walk on Earth),'' Vol. 38:
New York 2000-2001 edition, published by Diamond Big Co.
</P>
<P>
   AT THE MOVIES: As the film starts, the audience gets absorbed
immediately. Although you are not allowed to make noise in the
cinema, some people shout and cry. Literally, it is breathless
movie-watching. If you are watching action film, there will be a
storm of applause and cheers at victorious scenes. This noise isn't
unpleasant but heightens excitement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON SUNDAY: You see a lot of people sitting inside cafes and on
benches on the street, reading weighty The New York Times Sunday
edition, holding a cup of coffee in their hand.... People don't
read everything carried in there but only those sections that are
necessary to them, which is the New York style. Apart from reading
materials, in terms of information gathering, it is useful for even
those travellers who are not good at English. Even if you can't
read it, you will be in a jolly good mood just to open its pages
and look at it. It's a bit heavy to take back to Japan but it may
make a good souvenir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S OK IN HARLEM: There are frequent muggings and violence in
back streets. It is said drug transactions take place in abandoned
buildings, and drug addicts reportedly won't hesitate to kill
others in order to get $50. . . . New Yorkers dislike to venture
into such areas, and tourists should stay away from them. In fact,
the atmosphere changes drastically when you go off the main street.
Taxis, too, don't want to go into narrow streets. For some reason,
there are a lot of people in restricted buildings. Is it meaningful
to visit such areas for sightseeing? It is OK to go to church to
listen to gospel or visit a jazz club, but you shouldn't go to
observe poor people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON DENTAL VALUES: It depends on the kind of treatment and skills
of the doctor, but perhaps it may be cheaper to buy a return air
ticket and come back to Japan for treatment. However, it is true
that dental treatment in the U.S. is far advanced compared to that
in Japan. It could be said that once you have dental treatment
there, that tooth wouldn't require any more treatment for the rest
of your life. Also, treatment is completed within 4 to 5 days [in
Japan, it takes a few weeks to fill a cavity), so maybe it is a
good idea to make it an opportunity to expose yourself to American
dental treatment. It is up to you to decide which is inexpensive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   China &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From ``CityPack _ New York,'' Chinese-language edition,
published by Joint Publishing Ltd., Hong Kong, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   STREET MANNERS: Don't talk to the crazy people on the street,
even though they may seem fun to be with. . . . New York women are
very straightforward and can adapt well on the streets. So if
someone harasses you, be like New York ladies: speak your mind and
tell the person to blow off.
</P>
<P>
   Germany
</P>
<P>
   From ``Marco Polo _ New York,'' published by Mairs
Geographischer Verlag, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   RULES: Do not go to the park alone at night. And never carry
more than $50 in cash. Do not shop spontaneously. Shops on Fifth
Avenue which advertise ``going out of business'' sales are rarely
on the verge of actually closing. Do not eat from salad bars. They
are popular in delicatessens and self-service restaurants, but the
health commission warns that these unpackaged foods can make one
ill. . . . Do not count on seeing celebrities in restaurants which
have photos of famous people on the wall. The chances of seeing
Woody Allen or Madonna during a walk in Central Park or running
into Kevin Bacon or Demi Moore while shopping on Columbus Avenue
are greater. . . . Do not underestimate bicyclists. Always look
right and left even before crossing a one-way street, as bike
riders often speed in the opposite direction. Do not travel in
``gypsy cabs.'' New Yorkers do, but they also know how to negotiate
the right prices.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Goldstadt Fuehrer _ New York,'' published by
Goldstadtverlag, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   VALUABLES: When in a hotel room, always put the chain on the
door. Don't leave your key at reception. If a thief enters your
room, act as if you are sleeping. Call for help only after he has
left. . . . Don't visit deserted places like Central Park or the
Bowery at night. Don't ride elevators or enter subway stations
alone. Don't let your bags be carried by the mostly young men at
Penn or Grand Central Station as they will often disappear.
</P>
<P>
   THE COLOR OF MONEY: Be careful! Paper money is easy to confuse.
All bank notes are green and the same size. What makes them
different is the former president who appears on the front.

<P>
   From ``Globetrotter Travel Guide _ New York,'' by Michael Leech,
published by New Holland Publishers, Czech edition: 1999, Geodezie
Brno.
</P>
<P>
   LOGIC DEFIED: In theory, it should be easy to get in and out of
the city. But the traffic becomes unbearable at times, resulting in
traffic jams. Moreover, winter frosts sometimes eat through the
asphalt, creating large and dangerous holes. In the spring, the
yellow taxicabs race through those holes tilted to a side.
</P>
<P>
   CHINATOWN REALITY: The streets are always full of people,
everything is incredibly dirty, the facades scream with tasteless
bright neons. Yes, on one hand this place does stink, but on the
other hand it emanates spirituality. One thing is sure: it does not
try to pretend anything.

</P>
<P>
   From ``Manhattan,'' by Vanessa Letts, published by Cadogan.
</P>
<P>
   EAVESDROPPING: Keep your ears pricked at all times and you will
be as entertained as much by what you hear as by what you see.
Behind the gruff exteriors, Manhattanites are a wistful,
open-hearted lot, and, perhaps because over 40 per cent are
immigrants, they have a knack of muscling newcomers into instant
conversations which can culminate in lifelong friendships.
</P>
<P>
   DIALECT Bus drivers are a higher breed and will appreciate it if
you thank them as you disembark (one is said to salute his
passengers with ``Get'cher smile on, folks; nobody rides dis bus
today widdout a smile'').
</P>
<P>
   From ``New York City: The Rough Guide,'' by Martin Dunford and
Jack Holland.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBIES' COUSINS: The New York City Police _ the N.Y.P.D., a k a
``New York's Finest'' _ are for the most part approachable, helpful
and overworked. This means that asking directions gets a friendly
response, reporting a theft a weary ``Whaddya want me to do about
it'' _ and any smile is greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   MOOD: A sense of nervy self-preservation is rife here. People
make studied efforts to avoid eye contact, and any unusual
behaviour clears a space immediately: the atmosphere of impending
violence is sometimes sniffable. . .
</P>
<P>
   New York's tension doesn't automatically mean violence; it's
largely due to the frenetic pace at which most of the city
operates. Take several million people, pump them full of caffeine,
make them believe that they have to get where they're going five
minutes faster than is actually possible, and pack them onto a tiny
island _ there's bound to be an edge in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ... Few people seem to have time for anything not on their
mental schedule. Even asking for directions on the street is best
done with an awareness of this, ideally while moving at the same
pace and in the same direction of the informant.
</P>
<P>
   From ``New York City (Condensed),'' published by Lonely Planet.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREMES: Dense, immense, intense _ there is no other place with
as much upfront allure. The bagels have the most cream cheese, the
panhandlers have the best stories, you can take your dog to church,
you can pray to Mecca (or Wiccan) in the street, sell lobster
bisque from a hot-dog stand and no one will bat an eyelid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   France
</P>
<P>
   From ``Le Guide du Routard,'' published by Hachette, 2000/01.
</P>
<P>
   PACE: Watch out, New Yorkers despise those who are on the slow
track. To take a break for them is a waste of time. One has to go
faster and faster.
</P>
<P>
   ONE CROWDED PARK: New Yorkers are crazy about sports: gym, body
building, jogging. They work out early in the morning or after
work. On Sundays, they all meet at Central Park where they jog,
bike or roller-blade.
</P>
<P>
   TAXI DRIVERS: Curiously, New York taxi drivers hardly speak
American, or even English. At least, not the same English as you
do. They are foreigners from Asia or Haiti. They are very nice and
don't mind driving you only a few blocks! A dream for the
Parisians, used to the arrogance of local drivers. Yet, their way
of driving is harsh; they might slam on the brakes and suddenly
speed up, insult other drivers. This is a part of the city's
climate.
</P>
<P>
   HEDONISM: Alcohol is still taboo in the U.S. American society,
very puritan and conservative, allows the free sale of arms but has
outrageous regulations for anything related to taboo pleasures
(sex, marijuana, alcohol and even some rock CDs, considered too
subversive). . . . You can buy a Kalaschnikov without any special
license, yet you will have to show your passport while buying a
simple beer. You should never go out without your passport, as some
bars may request it. They are crazy, these Americans.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE: Americans drink all the time _ Coca-cola, Seven-up, Dr
Pepper, Fresca, Tab and other soft drinks. Thus, in many places you
can get as many refills of soda as you want. If you want to avoid
drinking what is called regular or American coffee, which tastes
like dishwater, buy some Nescafe and add it in.
</P>

office workers, at exactly 5 o'clock, will walk out of their
buildings, quickly taking off their dress shoes and putting on
sneakers for their long treks to the subway or buses. Like in the
Woody Allen movies (a New Yorker to the extreme), people are

   There are now official surveys to confirm that tourists are
taking over New York City.
</P>
<P>
   With a population approaching 9 million, the city played host to
about four tourists per resident last year, according to federal
surveys and tourist research announced by city officials last week.
The figures pushed New York up into second place for tourist
destinations in the United States, bested only by Orlando, Fla.,
home of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New York City's 36.7 million visitors came from within
the United States, but foreigners made up about 20 percent of the
total. Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and France had the honor of
providing the largest numbers of New York City's 6.6 million
international visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they know where to go? What do they expect of the
strange and fearsome New Yorker? What is considered surprising and
noteworthy?
</P>
<P>
   The questions are all the more interesting because the answers,
as found in excerpts from foreign guidebooks, reveal as much about
the culture the travelers are coming from as the one they intend to
gawk at.
</P>
<P>
   And they also demonstrate, as many New Yorkers can testify, that
no one has warned tourists not to come to a dead stop on Times
Square's sidewalks at rush hour.

New York 2000-2001 edition, published by Diamond Big Co.
</P>
<P>
   AT THE MOVIES: As the film starts, the audience gets absorbed
immediately. Although you are not allowed to make noise in the
cinema, some people shout and cry. Literally, it is breathless
movie-watching. If you are watching action film, there will be a
storm of applause and cheers at victorious scenes. This noise isn't
unpleasant but heightens excitement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON SUNDAY: You see a lot of people sitting inside cafes and on
benches on the street, reading weighty The New York Times Sunday
edition, holding a cup of coffee in their hand.... People don't
read everything carried in there but only those sections that are
necessary to them, which is the New York style. Apart from reading
materials, in terms of information gathering, it is useful for even
those travellers who are not good at English. Even if you can't
read it, you will be in a jolly good mood just to open its pages
and look at it. It's a bit heavy to take back to Japan but it may
make a good souvenir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S OK IN HARLEM: There are frequent muggings and violence in
back streets. It is said drug transactions take place in abandoned
buildings, and drug addicts reportedly won't hesitate to kill
others in order to get $50. . . . New Yorkers dislike to venture
into such areas, and tourists should stay away from them. In fact,
the atmosphere changes drastically when you go off the main street.
Taxis, too, don't want to go into narrow streets. For some reason,
there are a lot of people in restricted buildings. Is it meaningful
to visit such areas for sightseeing? It is OK to go to church to
listen to gospel or visit a jazz club, but you shouldn't go to
observe poor people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON DENTAL VALUES: It depends on the kind of treatment and skills
of the doctor, but perhaps it may be cheaper to buy a return air
ticket and come back to Japan for treatment. However, it is true
that dental treatment in the U.S. is far advanced compared to that
in Japan. It could be said that once you have dental treatment
there, that tooth wouldn't require any more treatment for the rest
of your life. Also, treatment is completed within 4 to 5 days [in
Japan, it takes a few weeks to fill a cavity), so maybe it is a
good idea to make it an opportunity to expose yourself to American
dental treatment. It is up to you to decide which is inexpensive.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   STREET MANNERS: Don't talk to the crazy people on the street,
even though they may seem fun to be with. . . . New York women are
very straightforward and can adapt well on the streets. So if
someone harasses you, be like New York ladies: speak your mind and
tell the person to blow off.

<P>
   RULES: Do not go to the park alone at night. And never carry
more than $50 in cash. Do not shop spontaneously. Shops on Fifth
Avenue which advertise ``going out of business'' sales are rarely
on the verge of actually closing. Do not eat from salad bars. They
are popular in delicatessens and self-service restaurants, but the
health commission warns that these unpackaged foods can make one
ill. . . . Do not count on seeing celebrities in restaurants which
have photos of famous people on the wall. The chances of seeing
Woody Allen or Madonna during a walk in Central Park or running
into Kevin Bacon or Demi Moore while shopping on Columbus Avenue
are greater. . . . Do not underestimate bicyclists. Always look
right and left even before crossing a one-way street, as bike
riders often speed in the opposite direction. Do not travel in
``gypsy cabs.'' New Yorkers do, but they also know how to negotiate
the right prices.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Goldstadt Fuehrer _ New York,'' published by
Goldstadtverlag, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   VALUABLES: When in a hotel room, always put the chain on the
door. Don't leave your key at reception. If a thief enters your
room, act as if you are sleeping. Call for help only after he has
left. . . . Don't visit deserted places like Central Park or the
Bowery at night. Don't ride elevators or enter subway stations
alone. Don't let your bags be carried by the mostly young men at
Penn or Grand Central Station as they will often disappear.
</P>
<P>
   THE COLOR OF MONEY: Be careful! Paper money is easy to confuse.
All bank notes are green and the same size. What makes them
different is the former president who appears on the front.

</P>
<P>
   LOGIC DEFIED: In theory, it should be easy to get in and out of
the city. But the traffic becomes unbearable at times, resulting in
traffic jams. Moreover, winter frosts sometimes eat through the
asphalt, creating large and dangerous holes. In the spring, the
yellow taxicabs race through those holes tilted to a side.
</P>
<P>
   CHINATOWN REALITY: The streets are always full of people,
everything is incredibly dirty, the facades scream with tasteless
bright neons. Yes, on one hand this place does stink, but on the
other hand it emanates spirituality. One thing is sure: it does not
try to pretend anything.

</P>
<P>
   EAVESDROPPING: Keep your ears pricked at all times and you will
be as entertained as much by what you hear as by what you see.
Behind the gruff exteriors, Manhattanites are a wistful,
open-hearted lot, and, perhaps because over 40 per cent are
immigrants, they have a knack of muscling newcomers into instant
conversations which can culminate in lifelong friendships.
</P>
<P>
   DIALECT Bus drivers are a higher breed and will appreciate it if
you thank them as you disembark (one is said to salute his
passengers with ``Get'cher smile on, folks; nobody rides dis bus
today widdout a smile'').
</P>
<P>
   From ``New York City: The Rough Guide,'' by Martin Dunford and
Jack Holland.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBIES' COUSINS: The New York City Police _ the N.Y.P.D., a k a
``New York's Finest'' _ are for the most part approachable, helpful
and overworked. This means that asking directions gets a friendly
response, reporting a theft a weary ``Whaddya want me to do about
it'' _ and any smile is greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   MOOD: A sense of nervy self-preservation is rife here. People
make studied efforts to avoid eye contact, and any unusual
behaviour clears a space immediately: the atmosphere of impending
violence is sometimes sniffable. . .
</P>
<P>
   New York's tension doesn't automatically mean violence; it's
largely due to the frenetic pace at which most of the city
operates. Take several million people, pump them full of caffeine,
make them believe that they have to get where they're going five
minutes faster than is actually possible, and pack them onto a tiny
island _ there's bound to be an edge in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ... Few people seem to have time for anything not on their
mental schedule. Even asking for directions on the street is best
done with an awareness of this, ideally while moving at the same
pace and in the same direction of the informant.
</P>
<P>
   From ``New York City (Condensed),'' published by Lonely Planet.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREMES: Dense, immense, intense _ there is no other place with
as much upfront allure. The bagels have the most cream cheese, the
panhandlers have the best stories, you can take your dog to church,
you can pray to Mecca (or Wiccan) in the street, sell lobster
bisque from a hot-dog stand and no one will bat an eyelid. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   From ``Le Guide du Routard,'' published by Hachette, 2000/01.
</P>
<P>
   PACE: Watch out, New Yorkers despise those who are on the slow
track. To take a break for them is a waste of time. One has to go
faster and faster.
</P>
<P>
   ONE CROWDED PARK: New Yorkers are crazy about sports: gym, body
building, jogging. They work out early in the morning or after
work. On Sundays, they all meet at Central Park where they jog,
bike or roller-blade.
</P>
<P>
   TAXI DRIVERS: Curiously, New York taxi drivers hardly speak
American, or even English. At least, not the same English as you
do. They are foreigners from Asia or Haiti. They are very nice and
don't mind driving you only a few blocks! A dream for the
Parisians, used to the arrogance of local drivers. Yet, their way
of driving is harsh; they might slam on the brakes and suddenly
speed up, insult other drivers. This is a part of the city's
climate.
</P>
<P>
   HEDONISM: Alcohol is still taboo in the U.S. American society,
very puritan and conservative, allows the free sale of arms but has
outrageous regulations for anything related to taboo pleasures
(sex, marijuana, alcohol and even some rock CDs, considered too
subversive). . . . You can buy a Kalaschnikov without any special
license, yet you will have to show your passport while buying a
simple beer. You should never go out without your passport, as some
bars may request it. They are crazy, these Americans.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE: Americans drink all the time _ Coca-cola, Seven-up, Dr
Pepper, Fresca, Tab and other soft drinks. Thus, in many places you
can get as many refills of soda as you want. If you want to avoid
drinking what is called regular or American coffee, which tastes
like dishwater, buy some Nescafe and add it in.
</P>
<P>
   CULINARY MATTERS: To say that an average American has bad eating
habits and eats too much is at the same time true and too easy.
Every region has its particularity: organic and vegetarian cusine
in California; cosmopolitan and diverse in New York. . . .
Americans are rather partial to food. You will be struck by the

GUNS: THE LAW AS SELLING TOOL

   BOSTON _ ``We must help protect our children, in our schools and
streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our nation's gun laws,''
declared Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in his acceptance speech at
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. In other words,
Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control
the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side
supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National
Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed by
guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at an
additional cost to society estimated as high as $100 billion. Are
current laws adequate to fight this scourge?
</P>
<P>
   The case of Bill Dollar suggests they aren't. For years, Dollar
and his sister Connie Jean, operating from their gun stores in
Birmingham, Ala., used friends, strangers, homeless people and drug
addicts to fill out federal handgun applications, then watched as
these people turned the weapons over to illegal dealers or gang
members from Brooklyn. It was a classic example of straw
purchasing, using someone to buy a gun for a person prohibited from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, guns from the Dollars' stores were used in at least
50 homicides and 901 violent crimes in 12 states, from
Massachusetts to Texas. But despite years of investigation by the
bureau and witnesses willing to testify that they lied on the
paperwork with the Dollars' knowledge, a federal judge dismissed
all the charges against them. Congress has never passed a law fully
and clearly barring the practice, so lying on a federal form was
not enough to convict corrupt gun dealers, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents and prosecutors say that, in fact, the nation's gun
laws are a hodgepodge, filled with loopholes and provisions devised
by pro-gun lawmakers to make the laws hard to enforce. Until the
last few years, all this was obscured by the fact that the illegal
gun market was not well understood. It was generally believed that
criminals and juveniles stole their guns, or borrowed them from
friends, and that given the nation's 200 million firearms, there
was little anyone could do to stanch the supply.
</P>
<P>
   But under prodding by the Clinton administration, the bureau
greatly expanded its efforts to trace the origin of guns used in
crimes, and it came up with a surprising discovery. More than half
of the guns that criminals use are purchased from federally
licensed dealers using gun traffickers, like those who went to the
Dollars, said David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   This is largely because criminals and juveniles are
brand-conscious, Kennedy said. They want the same high-powered
handguns they see in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Further data gained from tracing crime guns has now shown that
only a handful of suspect dealers, 1.2 percent of the nation's
83,000 licensed dealers, supply almost 60 percent of the guns used
in crimes. Kennedy said this information led to Boston's successful
campaign against guns. Supply was greatly reduced by targeting
suspect dealers, traffickers and straw purchasers, and only one
juvenile has been killed in Boston by a handgun in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the framework of gun laws, including the powers granted the
firearms bureau, has not kept pace with this information. In
addition to being hampered by Congress' failure to ban straw
purchases, the bureau is allowed to inspect a dealer's records only
once a year. It cannot send in undercover agents posing as felons
to buy guns from a gun store; it cannot maintain a computerized
record of gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also lacks authority to regulate sales by individuals
at gun shows or elsewhere, perhaps 40 percent of all sales. This
undermines the effect of the Brady law, which requires background
checks on handgun buyers, but only from licensed dealers, says a
study published this month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the restrictions created by the Firearm Owners
Protection Act of 1986, a law championed by the NRA. For the
firearms bureau to prosecute individuals who sell large numbers of
guns without a license, it must prove that they are engaged in the
business ``for livelihood and profit,'' a vague term that has led
to cases being thrown out of court. The law also reduced to a
misdemeanor the penalty for dealers who failed to keep records of
their sales, or forged them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, after 1986, it became somewhere
between difficult and impossible to prosecute dealers for selling
guns without keeping a record, because U.S. attorneys don't want to
waste their time prosecuting misdemeanors,'' said William Vizzard,
a retired ATF agent who is now a professor of criminal justice at
California State University at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, insists this
is all beside the point. ``The government has every statute it
needs to stop the bad guys, and when they don't, I think they are
just playing politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focusing on gun dealers, who LaPierre believes are
legitimate business people, he says the Clinton administration
should go after street criminals caught using guns, then prosecute
them in federal court, where they can be given harsher sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But who will make the arrests? The NRA has long opposed
expansion of the firearms bureau, calling its agents ``jackbooted
fascists,'' so that in 1998 it had just 1,631 agents, only nine
more than in 1973. And the Republican-controlled Congress has not
acted on a Clinton administration request last winter to hire 500
more ATF agents and 1,000 state and federal prosecutors
specifically to attack gun crime.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even successful prosecutions of gun law violations are
relatively ineffective. That is because penalties for gun crimes
are light, especially compared with the harsh mandatory sentences
for drug crimes, often 10 to 25 years in prison. In 1998, a task
force of federal firearms agents and New York City police officers
tracked two traffickers who had purchased 90 handguns in Georgia
and were selling them without a license in New York. One was
sentenced to 18 months incarceration. The other received six months
home detention.

   Further data gained from tracing crime guns has now shown that
only a handful of suspect dealers, 1.2 percent of the nation's
83,000 licensed dealers, supply almost 60 percent of the guns used
in crimes. Kennedy said this information led to Boston's successful
campaign against guns. Supply was greatly reduced by targeting
suspect dealers, traffickers and straw purchasers, and only one
juvenile has been killed in Boston by a handgun in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the framework of gun laws, including the powers granted the
firearms bureau, has not kept pace with this information. In
addition to being hampered by Congress' failure to ban straw
purchases, the bureau is allowed to inspect a dealer's records only
once a year. It cannot send in undercover agents posing as felons
to buy guns from a gun store; it cannot maintain a computerized
record of gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also lacks authority to regulate sales by individuals
at gun shows or elsewhere, perhaps 40 percent of all sales. This
undermines the effect of the Brady law, which requires background
checks on handgun buyers, but only from licensed dealers, says a
study published this month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the restrictions created by the Firearm Owners
Protection Act of 1986, a law championed by the NRA. For the
firearms bureau to prosecute individuals who sell large numbers of
guns without a license, it must prove that they are engaged in the
business ``for livelihood and profit,'' a vague term that has led
to cases being thrown out of court. The law also reduced to a
misdemeanor the penalty for dealers who failed to keep records of
their sales, or forged them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, after 1986, it became somewhere
between difficult and impossible to prosecute dealers for selling
guns without keeping a record, because U.S. attorneys don't want to
waste their time prosecuting misdemeanors,'' said William Vizzard,
a retired ATF agent who is now a professor of criminal justice at
California State University at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, insists this
is all beside the point. ``The government has every statute it
needs to stop the bad guys, and when they don't, I think they are
just playing politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focusing on gun dealers, who LaPierre believes are
legitimate business people, he says the Clinton administration
should go after street criminals caught using guns, then prosecute
them in federal court, where they can be given harsher sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But who will make the arrests? The NRA has long opposed
expansion of the firearms bureau, calling its agents ``jackbooted
fascists,'' so that in 1998 it had just 1,631 agents, only nine
more than in 1973. And the Republican-controlled Congress has not
acted on a Clinton administration request last winter to hire 500
more ATF agents and 1,000 state and federal prosecutors
specifically to attack gun crime.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even successful prosecutions of gun law violations are
relatively ineffective. That is because penalties for gun crimes
are light, especially compared with the harsh mandatory sentences
for drug crimes, often 10 to 25 years in prison. In 1998, a task
force of federal firearms agents and New York City police officers
tracked two traffickers who had purchased 90 handguns in Georgia
and were selling them without a license in New York. One was
sentenced to 18 months incarceration. The other received six months
home detention.

LIEBERMAN NOMINATION REFLECTS ACCEPTANCE OF JEWS IN AMERICAN
MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(editors: optional sidebar at end of article) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    While Ron Wyden was campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat in Oregon
in 1996, a local newspaper ran a letter denouncing him as an
``Ashkenazi'' _ clearly a code word for Jew. It set off an uproar
and some soul-searching in Oregon. How dare a responsible paper
publish such anti-Semitism? But what happened next was instructive:
the editors apologized, explaining that they had never heard the
term and were unaware it could give offense.
 &HT;    Wyden, whose parents fled Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic
senator representing a state in which Jews account for less than 1
percent of the population. Oregon, by the way, is home to not a few
militia members and black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet,
Wyden says he encountered only a ``small hard core'' of haters.
 &HT;    The tale of Wyden bears retelling for those who reacted to the
news of Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
as a running mate with the queasy suspicion that this just cannot
be good for the Jews. Will it awaken the sleeping giant of
anti-Semitism, they asked themselves? Will Jews be the scapegoats
if the Gore-Lieberman ticket is defeated?
 &HT;    Although bigotry thrives, Jews in this country have never before
had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews are no
longer considered ``the other'' in America.
 &HT;    As Wyden found in Oregon, even where Jews are few, acceptance is
at an all-time high. Americans typically either see Jews as
neighbors or kin, or as objects of fascination, or have no
experience with them at all. Paradoxically, the reasons have little
to do with television hits like ``Seinfeld'' and everything to do
with the nation's intense Christian faith. Visit the most
conservative evangelical church in America today and you will hear
from the pulpit mention of ``our Judeo-Christian heritage.''
President Ronald Reagan used the phrase in speeches, and the
concept has been thoroughly assimilated by the religious right.
Gary Bauer invoked it on the campaign trail.
 &HT;    Mainline Protestants talk of Jews and Christians as ``people of
the Book,'' the Old Testament that both faiths share. Pope John
Paul II stood in a Roman synagogue and referred to Jews as ``our
elder brothers,'' setting a tone for reconciliation that has
reverberated through the Roman Catholic Church.
 &HT;    More than mere tokenism, this language represents a major shift.
A broad swath of Christians in this country have begun to
recognize, to study and even embrace the Jewish roots of their
faith. Most Christians still believe that Jews would be better off
accepting Christ, but respect for Jews who do not has grown
substantially, scholars say.
 &HT;    ``I think there is a growing rapprochement and a sense of
commonality,'' said Max L. Stackhouse, professor of Christian
social ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary. ``Part of it has
to do with the increased encounters with others of the world
religions and the new sense of pluralism in this country.''
 &HT;    In other words, to the average American Christian who sees
Buddhist books on the best-seller list and Hindu temples rising in
the suburbs, Jews seem downright familiar.
 &HT;    ``Jews are more like us,'' said Stackhouse, summing up a common
attitude among Christians. ``We feel greater affinity to those who
are Jewish.''
 &HT;    Another factor is intermarriage, each wedding vow a chink
closing up the old religious divide. The 50 percent intermarriage
rate that for 10 years has caused angst among Jews has a flip side:
more and more Americans count a Jew in the family tree. When Uncle
Michael goes upstairs to read the children a bedtime story, it
becomes harder to regard Jews as ``the other.''
 &HT;    But what really keeps many Jews awake at night is the fear that
every new Jewish-sounding surname in the headlines only stokes the
widely held conspiracy theories that the world is run by Jews.
 &HT;    Someone who knows the conspiracy thinking well is Paul T.
Coughlin, an evangelical Christian who wrote ``Secrets, Plots and
Hidden Agendas'' (InterVarsity Press, 2000), because he was stunned
by the amount of conspiratorial talk from callers to his Christian
radio show in Oregon.
 &HT;    ``There are millions of people who feel that Jews control the
economy through what's called the New World Order, and people on
the far right argue that this is all dictated in the Book of
Revelation where the Apostle John wrote about a world government,''
he said.
 &HT;    But surprisingly, Coughlin said, even for a large majority of
those believers _ all but the anti-Semitic and racist fringe _
Judaism is ``not an issue.''
 &HT;    Why? They believe that membership in the New World Order is
determined ``more by ideology than heritage,'' he said. ``It's
actually liberal elitists, the media, people in universities, who
are going to control the New World Order.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (MORE)
 &HT;     
 
 BC-JEWS-U.S.-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT  
 UNDATED: World Order.''  
 &HT;     
 &HT;    Although liberal Jews are suspects, Lieberman, as an Orthodox
Jew who represents conservative family values, is not, Coughlin
said. The senator may convince the conspiracy thinkers that
``Jewish'' and ``liberal'' are not synonymous, he said. He adds
that many of these same Christian conspiracy thinkers actually
venerate Jews because the Bible talks of God's covenant with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ``It is actually beneficial for Lieberman
to be Jewish,'' he said.
 &HT;    This is not to claim that anti-Semitism has been eradicated,
like smallpox. It lives on, mutates, makes people sick. Wyden says
he received a heap of hate mail when, in a memorable moment
broadcast on television, he asked a lineup of tobacco executives at
a congressional hearing whether nicotine is addictive. The
anti-Semitic letters came mostly from those in tobacco-growing
country, accusing him of destroying their livelihoods, but were
filled with ``religious animus,'' he said.
 &HT;    In the Midwest, the Rev. David Ostendorf, executive director of
the Center for New Community in Chicago, said: ``We did a seminar a
few months ago with five or six Chicago high schools, and when we
asked how many of you have seen racist symbols like swastikas in
your neighborhoods, 90 percent of the kids raised their hands. It
kind of jarred us.''
 &HT;    The selection of Lieberman is likely to uncap a geyser of ugly
extremism. Already, Internet message boards have been swamped with
anti-Semitic postings. The head of the local chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in
Dallas rambled on about greedy Jews on a talk show.
 &HT;    The response was telling. Scores of people posted Internet
messages expressing their disgust at anti-Semitism. The NAACP
official was immediately dismissed.
 &HT;    ``You have your crazies,'' said Jerome A. Chanes, the editor of
``Anti-Semitism in America Today: Exploding the Myths'' (Carol
Publishing, 1995). ``But in the year 2000, whatever anti-Semitism
does exist does not compromise the ability of any Jew to
participate in the workings of society at any level.''
 &HT;    Gallup polls show that 92 percent of Americans say they would
vote for a qualified Jew for president, up from 62 percent in 1958.
Other polls that ask the question differently show similar results.
Even if twice as many people are lying _ and respondents to polls
gauging tolerance often do _ that is still a huge approval rating,
Chanes said. The polls indicate that it is far worse to be a Mormon
or an atheist running for office than a Jew.
 &HT;    So why do polls also show that Jews see anti-Semitism as a
serious problem in this country, and one likely to worsen? There is
a generational divide, said Spencer Blakeslee, author of ``The
Death of American Anti-Semitism'' (Praeger), between older,
immigrant Jews who experienced the most vicious anti-Semitism and
``the post-World War II generation,'' for whom the Holocaust is
history.
 &HT;    A headline in last week's New York Observer rendered the divided
response to the Lieberman candidacy partly in Yiddish: ``Alter
Kockers Shaking, Pishers Are Thrilled.''
 &HT;    ``We have a lot of Jews walking around who are frightened at
things they need not be frightened about,'' said Blakeslee, a
sociologist at Framingham State College in Massachusetts. ``When in
the world are Jews going to learn to take yes for an answer?''
 &HT;    Wyden said that for him the challenge is ``not overt
anti-Semitism or prejudice, but that there may be a significant
number of people who have had little or no contact with Jews,
aren't familiar with the Holocaust and so much of the history that
Jews are sensitive to.''
 &HT;    Wyden says he considers any campaign for a Jewish candidate to
be ``a terrific opportunity, because the slate is clean.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the exhaustive analysis of Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate, one factor has been strangely
overlooked: Lieberman's uncanny resemblance to Sam Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Voters of a certain generation may not be able to look at the
man who would be vice president without thinking of the late
character actor best remembered as the High Lama in ``Lost
Horizon,'' Dr. Zorba in the TV series ``Ben Casey,'' and Gunga Din.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is known as a religious man; Jaffe often played
priests, though he too was Jewish, born Shalom Jaffe in 1891 on
Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned half a century (Jaffe died in 1984), he
played only a few Jewish roles. In ``Ben-Hur,'' he was Saimonides,
Charlton Heston's family retainer and book-keeper, who utters the
line: ``Judah Ben-Hur! You've come back to us like a returning
faith!''
</P>
<P>
   But it is in ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' that the connection with
the senator takes on cosmic meaning. Here, in Elia Kazan's
indictment of anti-Semitism, Jaffe played a Jewish professor. His
name? Lieberman.

A GAP IN TEST SCORES BECOMES A TALKING POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once it was the great taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most American schools and policy-makers are talking about
it openly: the achievement gap between black and Hispanic students
on the one hand and whites and Asians on the other, which persists
even among the ranks of the most well off and well educated.
Fourteen racially diverse suburbs in different parts of the country
have joined to share what appear to be successful strategies for
closing the gap. As a way of forcing school districts to deal with
the disparity, some states are requiring them to break out their
test score data by race.
</P>
<P>
   The breaking of the silence still produces some uncomfortable
confrontations. When a group of black and white parents in suburban
Nyack, N.Y., decided to release the numbers broken down by race,
many middle-class black parents wanted to suppress the scores and
bitterly lashed out at the others for crusading on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities, especially blacks, are often the most reluctant to
talk about the gap in test scores, because such discussions have
been haunted by arguments about genetic inferiority. Unable to
explain the gap, they worry that people will jump to the conclusion
that blacks and Hispanics simply are not as smart.
</P>
<P>
   And often, people have.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic argument was repeated in a section of ``The Bell
Curve'' (The Free Press, 1994 ) by Richard J. Herrnstein and
Charles Murray. Other academics have offered a range of evidence to
debunk their position, which caused an uproar. But Stephanie
Robinson of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group in Washington
that works with communities trying to raise test scores, says the
book merely put into print notions hinted at elsewhere, from
portrayals of blacks in film to banks' refusal to offer mortgages
to those living in black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the history you've got behind the notion that black
people are inferior,'' said Robinson, who is black. ``There's
entertainment history, academic history, there's conventional
wisdom, there's economic history. All of those systems that
consistently reinforce the negative message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got so much weight. If you have a scale, there's all this
history over there, and the evidence over here hasn't been able to
balance it out. We're bucking 200 years of history here.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they really began to notice the gap in the 1980s
as American schools experienced a rise in the number of Asian
students, who tended to score very high, which made lower scores
among blacks and Hispanics all the more striking. In the 1990s, the
gap between white-Asian scores and black-Hispanic scores widened
even more.
</P>
<P>
   Any white who raised the issue risked being called a racist; any
black who did was branded a sellout or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started talking about this 15 years ago, a lot of
folks didn't want to hear it,'' said Edmund W. Gordon, an emeritus
professor of psychology at Yale, who helped conduct a recent
College Board study on the achievement gap. Gordon is black. ``They
felt, `We know we're not doing well; we want to know what to do
about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You tended to get some negative reaction from minority
communities,'' Gordon said, ``because they think, and I think
rightly so, that there is often a very strong element of blaming
the victim.'' He added that minorities often feel that test scores
are used to call attention to alleged inferiority rather than to
inform interventions.
</P>
<P>
   Why talk about it now? Part of the reason may be timing. ``We've
had a few years since the last genetic inferiority attack,'' Gordon
said. ``And so that fear has quieted down a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some trace the reluctance to discuss the achievement gap back to
the 1965 report on the black family by Assistant Labor Secretary
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who described a vicious circle of
fatherlessness and poverty. The backlash from black leaders chilled
intellectual debate.
</P>
<P>
   For years that made it impossible for anyone to consider openly
whether social factors might be behind the gap, said Abigail
Thernstrom, whose widely debated book, ``America in Black and
White'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997), written with her husband,
Stephan, argued that affirmative action policies are misguided
because they deflect attention from the real problem: that blacks
are not well prepared in elementary and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big no-no,'' said Thernstrom, whose next book is on
the achievement gap. ``The fact that nobody is screaming when
George W. Bush talks about the soft bigotry of low expectations,
that shows how much the conversation has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, many black academics are leading the discussion
on the racial gap in scores, and they are pointing to social
factors as the most likely causes. Claude M. Steele, a Stanford
University psychologist who has studied the performance of black
students, argues that racial stereotyping adversely influences many
black students, who start to believe that they are limited by
genetics and carry out a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Ferguson, a researcher at Harvard University, suggests
that teachers' low expectations hinder black students. The results
are often at odds with a history that, black educators say, has
included a reverence for education, even during slavery when
learning to read was punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that some of us who are fairly well identified with
the minority community, whose politics are not suspect, have
insisted on talking about it has made it acceptable,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Black parents are helping to ease the conversation, and the
growing middle class is demanding more from its schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have more and more minority folks in this country who not
only aspire to but actually attain higher levels of education,''
said Michael Osnato, superintendent of schools in Montclair, N.J.,
one of the 14 communities involved in sharing information,
including the use of study groups and advanced courses, to help
close the gap. ``It's created a momentum and awareness to the
issue.'' Some of the other districts are Amherst, Mass.; Evanston,
Ill.; Chapel Hill, N.C.; and Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about solutions has been the logical next step. Experts
are trying to identify the places or cases that defy the trend and
to replicate or learn from their success.
</P>
<P>
   But even that search requires a certain fortitude and a
willingness to keep talking through the difficult, if not painful,
initial discussions. But the solutions are often elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us,'' Gordon said of his work with the College Board,
``the most discouraging thing is that after three years of work, we
ended up being better able to describe the problem than to offer
solutions.''

A GAP IN TEST SCORES BECOMES A TALKING POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once it was the great taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most American schools and policy-makers are talking about
it openly: the achievement gap between black and Hispanic students
on the one hand and whites and Asians on the other, which persists
even among the ranks of the most well off and well educated.
Fourteen racially diverse suburbs in different parts of the country
have joined to share what appear to be successful strategies for
closing the gap. As a way of forcing school districts to deal with
the disparity, some states are requiring them to break out their
test score data by race.
</P>
<P>
   The breaking of the silence still produces some uncomfortable
confrontations. When a group of black and white parents in suburban
Nyack, N.Y., decided to release the numbers broken down by race,
many middle-class black parents wanted to suppress the scores and
bitterly lashed out at the others for crusading on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities, especially blacks, are often the most reluctant to
talk about the gap in test scores, because such discussions have
been haunted by arguments about genetic inferiority. Unable to
explain the gap, they worry that people will jump to the conclusion
that blacks and Hispanics simply are not as smart.
</P>
<P>
   And often, people have.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic argument was repeated in a section of ``The Bell
Curve'' (The Free Press, 1994 ) by Richard J. Herrnstein and
Charles Murray. Other academics have offered a range of evidence to
debunk their position, which caused an uproar. But Stephanie
Robinson of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group in Washington
that works with communities trying to raise test scores, says the
book merely put into print notions hinted at elsewhere, from
portrayals of blacks in film to banks' refusal to offer mortgages
to those living in black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the history you've got behind the notion that black
people are inferior,'' said Robinson, who is black. ``There's
entertainment history, academic history, there's conventional
wisdom, there's economic history. All of those systems that
consistently reinforce the negative message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got so much weight. If you have a scale, there's all this
history over there, and the evidence over here hasn't been able to
balance it out. We're bucking 200 years of history here.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they really began to notice the gap in the 1980s
as American schools experienced a rise in the number of Asian
students, who tended to score very high, which made lower scores
among blacks and Hispanics all the more striking. In the 1990s, the
gap between white-Asian scores and black-Hispanic scores widened
even more.
</P>
<P>
   Any white who raised the issue risked being called a racist; any
black who did was branded a sellout or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started talking about this 15 years ago, a lot of
folks didn't want to hear it,'' said Edmund W. Gordon, an emeritus
professor of psychology at Yale, who helped conduct a recent
College Board study on the achievement gap. Gordon is black. ``They
felt, `We know we're not doing well; we want to know what to do
about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You tended to get some negative reaction from minority
communities,'' Gordon said, ``because they think, and I think
rightly so, that there is often a very strong element of blaming
the victim.'' He added that minorities often feel that test scores
are used to call attention to alleged inferiority rather than to
inform interventions.
</P>

THIS IS EXTREMELY SPORTING

(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ See. See Lee. See Lee Dansie, a champion street
luger with a Mick Jagger haircut, come streaking through the fog
toward the Pacific Ocean on a flying bit of metal, shoes smoking.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 2000 X Games, in which some 450 athletes from 23
countries participate in such once-renegade ``extreme'' sports as
dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line skating, street luge and
sky-surfing. That last is the ultimate exercise in narcissism, in
which a surf-rider and a camera flyer, sky-surfboards strapped to
their feet and parachutes to their backs, jump simultaneously out
of a plane at 13,000 feet, and fall for 9,000 feet or so,
spiraling, flipping and diving as they hurl merrily toward earth at
about 180 mph, filming all the while.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this city of extremes, both topographical and
economic, has embraced the X games with messianic fervor. Last
summer, the event drew over 270,000 spectators, not to mention over
5 million ESPN viewers, including 37 percent of all male teen-agers
in the United States, according to Nielsen analysis for the
company. (The games will start on Thursday; delayed television
coverage starts on ABC and ESPN this Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   Josh Blackman, 5, standing bug-eyed on Friday as the lugers,
bigger boys with iron abdominals, whizzed past him in a practice
event, succinctly summed up the appeal of the lugers: ``They turn
and they wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   The games, now six years old _ an eternity in youth culture _ as
well as the newer Gravity Games on NBC, are spawning extremes of
their own. This fall, for instance, will see the debut of not one
but two brands of extreme sports trading cards. The stunt biker
Dave Mirra, the Michael Jordan of the dirt set, has his own chewing
gum (Dave Mirra's BMX Bubble Gum), as well as his own pro model
signature Adidas sneaker as well as a cereal en route.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous athletes, including the skateboarder Tony Hawk, ace
executor of ``the 900'' (two and a half turns in the air on a
skateboard off a vertical ramp), have their own videogames, and
extreme action figures and finger-size street luges and dirt bikes
are popping up at toy stores near you. ( Dansie, soon to be an
action figure, said he was looking forward to his check.)
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the unkindest blow to the dwindling band of athletes
who are corporation-shunning street-purists, a Barney-colored
miniature ``vert ramp'' with skateboard now comes with every
McDonald's Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way things work,'' said Chad Kagy, a 21-year-old
stunt biker and bronze medalist from Gilroy, Calif., who may
resemble Harry Potter on his Nimbus 2000 broomstick as he performs
his favorite trick this week. Dubbed the Superman Seat Grab, the
move has his feet soaring behind the bike while his left hand grabs
the seat and his right hand spins the handlebars (got that?). ``One
day you're riding with your friends,'' he said. ``The next day
people want you to represent their bubble gum.''
</P>
<P>
   The extremely big business of extreme sports has been fueled not
only by television but by extreme agents, who now represent
approximately 20 percent of all athletes competing in the games.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme marketing is extending far beyond sports figures and
products. In sportswear, ankle-high skateboarding shoes are
replacing hightops, and cargo pants with extra pockets have become
teen-age uniforms. Adolescent males and those beyond can avail
themselves of Right Guard Xtreme Deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Astephen, founder of The Familie, an alternative youth
marketing agency that represents extreme athletes, says that the
days of ``hey bro'' sponsorship were over, which he defined as an
ex-rider coming up to a rider and saying: ``Hey bro, what's going
on? Wear our sticker and we'll give you a couple of bucks.''
Corporations, Astephen said, have woken up to the fact that extreme
athletes speak to the lucrative market of Y Generation (12- to
24-year-old) males and their $650 billion in annual spending power.
The lure: individualistic sports that look cool and don't require a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are tangible heroes,'' Astephen said of his stable.
``Tony Hawk tours local skate parks and skates with your son or
daughter. When's the last time you saw Tiger Woods or Michael
Jordan doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking svelte for a 47-year-old in racing leathers, Steve
Fernando, a Los Angeles firefighter who took up street luging after
watching it on television, offered a contrasting theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are having virtual thrills through computers
and Playstations,'' he said. ``We're an adjunct on TV, seen through
a point-of-view camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bryant, editor of Men's Journal, a bible of testosterone,
notes that every generation has its instruments of rebellion,
whether electric guitars or scooters whizzing up Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports, he said, ``reject the apparent dullness of
modern life, at least as perceived by a 20-year-old.'' He sees them
as an attempt to ``juice up life,'' to inject a note of edginess
into a flush economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where certain socioeconomic groups are
thinking, if life is full of so many possibilities, why am I not
having more fun?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that efforts to market the extreme
naturally take the edge right out of it. Or, as Bryant put it,
``What could be more mundane than deodorant?''

SCIENCE: IT'S NOT JUST EVOLUTION ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state
school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal
about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how
quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year
supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science
curriculum. The word is expected to be restored after the November
school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this
conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic. Rather,
they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their
children's future and the future of their state. These dot-com
times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents
believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a realization that we can't have an informed
generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell,
a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center
for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the
Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. ``It's their
right, it's their inheritance. Instead of seeing science as an
enemy, you see it as a tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and
economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution
proponents in Kansas. Scientists and school board candidates _ even
the governor _ said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if
the new science standards stayed in place. Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer
said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been
``scared off'' out of concern that their employees' children would
not be getting a good education and that the work force would not
be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes
affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she
worried the new science standards could ``put students at a
disadvantage on a national level'' and that ``students from out of
state won't want to come here and study because they feel the
standards won't be up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to
those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning.
Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of
the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and
others brought in speakers like Dr. Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown
University microbiologist and author of ``Finding Darwin's God: A
Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In his talks, Miller quoted St. Thomas Aquinas, ``who says it's
wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works
because what it will do is drive people away from religion,'' Case
said. ``That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they
could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics. A 1999
Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored
teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. Another
poll, released this year by the People for the American Way
Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching
evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that
evolution ``is far from being proven scientifically.'' And 68
percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God
created humans and guided their development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing,''
said Dr. James F. Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso
University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at
the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago. ``I really do
sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for
how the two areas that are so important to our life can work
compatibly together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and
research projects like the human genome project now have ethics
panels with religious representatives. And ``in religious
communities there is an awareness of how important scientific
developments have become,'' Moore said. ``If we don't know what's
going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how
can any religious voices really play a role? We will be left behind
and not know what we need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the battle between evolution and
creationism is over. But the language in which it is fought,
especially on the religious right, has changed. Proponents of
``intelligent design,'' for example, assert that the earth is too
complex to have been created by random processes. Only some sort of
an intelligence could have done it, they say, and they seek to
debunk evolution by, for instance, pointing to gaps in the fossil
record.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments, which scientists find specious, have been well
received in some quarters. Alabama and Oklahoma, for example, have
included disclaimers in biology textbooks that raise questions
about the certainty of evolution. Kentucky recently eliminated the
word ``evolution'' from its curriculum, substituting the phrase
``change over time.''

</P>
<P>
   Several other states are debating similar moves. In Arizona and
Ohio, bills have been introduced that would require teachers to
present evidence for and against evolution, and Case said he has
been contacted by people in Minnesota looking to fend off such a
challenge. And dozens of local school boards across the country are
considering teaching some form of creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California who supports intelligent design, said the Kansas episode
would only stiffen the spines of evolution opponents to show ``that
the neo-Darwinian sensibility is intellectually vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as science continues its inexorable progress, some believe
that religion must, ultimately, embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the church has been good at this,'' said the
Rev. Christopher Carlisle, an Episcopal priest who co-directs the
God and Science Project at Amherst College. ``I think it has been
self-preservationist, and I think the result of that has been we
have been losing people and we have less and less to preserve. An
awful lot of the future of the church depends upon the church's
welcoming these questions and these conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and
Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made
scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical
perspective that is the basis of scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have to believe in evolution as if it were a
religion,'' Teresi said. ``You see evolution being taught in a very
teleological way _ this organism is built this way because. This
would never happen in physics, where the whole thing is to poke
holes in other people's theories. I would teach evolution with all
its flaws, and emphasize the randomness. We have to live with the
idea that humans are random creatures.''

SCIENCE: IT'S NOT JUST EVOLUTION ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state
school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal
about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how
quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year
supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science
curriculum. The word is expected to be restored after the November
school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this
conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic. Rather,
they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their
children's future and the future of their state. These dot-com
times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents
believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a realization that we can't have an informed
generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell,
a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center
for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the
Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. ``It's their
right, it's their inheritance. Instead of seeing science as an
enemy, you see it as a tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and
economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution
proponents in Kansas. Scientists and school board candidates _ even
the governor _ said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if
the new science standards stayed in place. Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer
said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been
``scared off'' out of concern that their employees' children would
not be getting a good education and that the work force would not
be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes
affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she
worried the new science standards could ``put students at a
disadvantage on a national level'' and that ``students from out of
state won't want to come here and study because they feel the
standards won't be up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to
those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning.
Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of
the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and
others brought in speakers like Dr. Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown
University microbiologist and author of ``Finding Darwin's God: A
Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In his talks, Miller quoted St. Thomas Aquinas, ``who says it's
wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works
because what it will do is drive people away from religion,'' Case
said. ``That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they
could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics. A 1999
Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored
teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. Another
poll, released this year by the People for the American Way
Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching
evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that
evolution ``is far from being proven scientifically.'' And 68
percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God
created humans and guided their development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing,''
said Dr. James F. Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso
University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at
the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago. ``I really do
sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for
how the two areas that are so important to our life can work
compatibly together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and
research projects like the human genome project now have ethics
panels with religious representatives. And ``in religious
communities there is an awareness of how important scientific
developments have become,'' Moore said. ``If we don't know what's
going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how
can any religious voices really play a role? We will be left behind
and not know what we need to know.''
</P>

AL GORE PREPARES FOR HIS BIG CLOSE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No matter whether you think Al Gore should be the
next president, give him this much: He has transformed the vice
presidency, the subject of generations of derision, into more than
the butt of jokes. Not content to languish at state funerals, Gore
has been the most productive and industrious vice president in
modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. George W. Bush, in a rare compliment to his rival,
volunteered recently that Gore had been a good No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   So it is remarkable that Gore's political coming out here this
week has been designed not merely as the usual paean to the party's
new standard-bearer, but also as a production that will neglect,
obscure and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square
Office,'' only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor from the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the program calls for speaker after speaker to rattle
on about Al Gore the Tennessee farm boy, Al Gore the Harvard
student, Al Gore the enlistee in Vietnam, Al Gore the reporter, Al
Gore the House member, Al Gore the senator and _ blithely skipping
the last eight years _ Al Gore, the man of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that Gore championed an ambitious program to streamline
the federal bureaucracy, or that he was the point man in relations
with Russia, or that he bested Ross Perot in a debate, clearing the
path for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Until he deletes
the word ``vice'' from his title, the political calculation is that
Gore will not be seen as his own man.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unfairly, Bush, who presides over a single state (one in
which the chief executive office is notably weak) and is far less
seasoned in governing, can more easily claim the leadership mantle
because he, at least, is in charge of something.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voters are apt to say Bush is as experienced a leader
as Gore. Asked in a poll taken in late March whether Gore's
performance as vice president made them more or less likely to
support him, 28 percent of registered voters said more likely, 27
percent said less likely and 43 percent said it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most aggressive move to submerge his vice presidency came
last week when he named a No. 2 of his own. By making history in
picking Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first Jewish running mate of a
major party, Gore succeeded in persuading at least some voters to
take another measure of him as a decisive, imaginative leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in unveiling Lieberman, Gore was so determined to shed his
own service as No. 2 that he made no reference to the office itself
or to his first-hand knowledge of why it is vital to have a capable
second-in-command. The Gore campaign has been so determined to blot
out the vice president from Al Gore that his title was
intentionally not included in mentions of him in the Democratic
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists and academics argue that it is folly for Gore
to flee from the governing credentials that would seem to be his
most compelling selling point. If anything, they argue, six years
after the Gingrich revolution that catapulted Washington outsiders
into power, voters may be ready for tested steadiness.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University
of California at San Diego, said, ``His strongest suit is, `You've
never had it so good.' He needs to nail down the case that the good
times we're all enjoying can be attributed to the Clinton-Gore
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoffing at the notion that Gore should be dwelling on his
tenure in the White House, William Daley, the Gore campaign
chairman, said: ``He'd be murdered by you all if he was trying to
take credit for all he's done in the last eight years. People want
to hear what you're going to do as president. They don't want to
walk down Memory Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories may be the single biggest reason Gore refuses to
embrace his vice presidency _ but those memories are of President
Clinton. The belief among many Gore advisers is that the
president's transgressions have so soiled the White House that
recitations of Gore's accomplishments would immediately be tainted
by association, or revive talk of the vice president's own lapses,
like his attending a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple. The one
subject Gore is happy to recall, and may well underscore at the
national convention, is his contribution to the longstanding
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   But there is far more at play than Gore trying to break free
from his boss. His advisers say they realize through polling and
focus groups that the vice president desperately needs to spruce up
his image. ``They know Al Gore's been vice president, or they have
an impression of stiff and boring,'' Daley said. ``But here's a guy
who's had a full life.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to reintroduce Gore and play up his human side has
been a constant in his campaign, and his career, often to little
avail.

 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-GORE-IMAGE-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; LOS ANGELES: little avail. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, campaign advisers say that when Gore takes
center stage, they want voters to remember these facts: He opted to
serve in Vietnam at a time when many young men were finding excuses
not to. He is passionate about protecting the environment. He stood
boldly on his own in the Senate and, over the objections of
prominent Democratic leaders, voted for the use of force in the
Persian Gulf war. He is such a family man that he thinks nothing of
altering his schedule so he can watch his children play lacrosse.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp is playing up such biographical snippets to
address the central paradox of the Gore candidacy: advisers fear
the very skills that make Gore a successful sidekick _ he is
disciplined, dutiful and loyal _ are not the qualities people look
for in a president.
</P>
<P>
   The notion is that voters want an engaging leader who is not
simply a loyal trooper. They do not think someone deserves the Oval
Office simply because he has diligently climbed the rungs of power.
``You don't remind people what you  &UR; were  &LR;  when you're looking for
a promotion,'' said Marla Romash, a longtime adviser to Gore. ``You
want to convince them that you're up for the bigger job.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three times in the last 80 years has a sitting vice
president run on his own after eight years in office, and both
Nixon and Bush had to struggle to get voters to stop thinking of
them as junior partners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon didn't even want the
popular president, Dwight Eisenhower, stumping on his behalf, so
eager was he to get out of his boss' shadow.
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem that has now fallen to Gore, who knows full
well that for every commercial his campaign runs that features the
candidate surrounded by his family or extolling his vision,
Republicans intend to portray him just where he does not want to be
seen: in service to his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can not make the eight years vaporize,'' said Mark
McKinnon, Bush's chief media strategist. ``They are there, and he
has to live with them.''

   Greens Joke and Reformers Fight
</P>
<P>
   It is easily the wittiest candidate commercial of the 2000
election. In a parody of MasterCard's ``priceless'' television
campaign, Ralph Nader's first spot takes aim at the ways the
major-party candidates finance their runs for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: 1,000 dollars a plate,''
the announcer says. ``Campaign ads filled with half-truths: 10
million dollars. Promises to special interest groups: over 10
billion dollars. Finding out the truth: priceless.''
</P>

   The Green Party standard-bearer, who polls show is likely to
siphon off some liberal Gore supporters, was not the only
third-party candidate muscling his way onto television last week:
The Reform Party, meeting to pick its candidate in Long Beach,
Calif., broke into rival conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle was between the conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan, representing a new guard in the party formed by Ross
Perot in 1992, and a faction of party veterans that was backing
John Hagelin, a physicist who has run for president twice on the
Natural Law Party ticket. ``We are going to reach back to the 20
million people who voted for Ross Perot in 1992, the people who are
not looking for a right-wing extremist,'' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan seemed to be practicing his own politics of
inclusiveness on Friday, when he selected as his running mate a
black educator from Los Angeles, Ezola Foster. ``We welcome
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other distractions for the Gore campaign. In South
Barrington, Ill., President Clinton faced 4,000 members of the
Willow Creek Community Church on Thursday to speak about his life
after an adulterous affair and the effect that event should not
have on the man he wants to succeed him.

   Psychologists have long assumed that while people in Beijing
might ponder different topics than those in Oklahoma City, their
ways of gathering information and making sense of the world were
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   New research, however, indicates that people from different
cultures may in fact think differently.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory studies comparing East Asians and Americans, Dr.
Richard Nisbett, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, and his colleagues uncovered two separate thinking
styles. The Asians tended to be more ``holistic,'' showing greater
attention to context, a tolerance for contradiction, and less
dependence on logic. Westerners were more ``analytic,'' avoiding
contradiction, focusing on objects removed from their context, and
more reliant on logic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe an animated underwater scene, for example,
Asians were more likely to describe the background and the
relationship between objects. Americans focused immediately on the
largest fish.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbett's work, because it is systematic and repeatable, may
prompt scientists to re-evaluate their notions of what is universal
and what is local. Dr. Susan Andersen is a professor of psychology
at New York University and an associate editor of the journal
Psychological Review, which will publish a theoretical paper by
Nisbett and his colleagues. She said the research ``turns on its
head a great deal of the science that many of us have been doing,
and so it's sort of scary and thrilling at the same time.'

   Despite Protests, Another Texas Execution
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Cruz, a mentally retarded 33- year-old with an IQ of 64,
was one of two men executed on Wednesday in Huntsville, Texas.
``The execution of persons who are mentally retarded serves no
principled purpose and demeans our system of justice,'' Martha W.
Barrett, the president of the American Bar Association, wrote to
Gov. George W. Bush. The European Union also had called on Bush to
spare Cruz, saying the execution of the mentally retarded violated
international human rights norms.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was condemned to death for the 1988 rape and murder of a
24-year-old woman. His last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court was
denied by a 7-2 vote.

   In a dispute over organized labor's future in the New Economy,

   Tire Trouble

   They can't find the flaw in the design or the materials or the

they are recalling 6.5 million tires used on Ford SUVs and a

<P>
   The Bridgestone/Firestone company promises to replace them all _
but only by next summer, a delay that has angered consumers and

   After two Jewish cemeteries were desecrated in the western

   The National Missile Mess

   As President Clinton nears a decision on building a national
missile defense, an intelligence report warned that the decision
could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold, while
Russia could take destabilizing steps like placing multiple
warheads on its ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The report could erode support for the administration's proposed
missile shield, which is also facing technological hurdles. Defense
Secretary William Cohen postponed making his recommendation to
Clinton by at least a month, citing ``a number of difficult
issues,'' including the need for more tests and delays in building
a new booster rocket.

   Epsilon Eridani was one of two stars focused on in 1960 in the
first search for radio signals from alien civilizations _ and the
first false alarm. As soon as a radio telescope was pointed at the

   Greens Joke and Reformers Fight
</P>
<P>
   It is easily the wittiest candidate commercial of the 2000
election. In a parody of MasterCard's ``priceless'' television
campaign, Ralph Nader's first spot takes aim at the ways the
major-party candidates finance their runs for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: 1,000 dollars a plate,''
the announcer says. ``Campaign ads filled with half-truths: 10
million dollars. Promises to special interest groups: over 10
billion dollars. Finding out the truth: priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   That last line is narrated over a photograph of Nader as a young
consumer advocate. But the commercial overlooks Nader's latest
public role: professional thorn in Vice President Al Gore's side.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: There's English, and there's English
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of times my wife and I turn to each other to ask,
``What did he say?'' during the viewing of a TV program or movie is
increasing with alarming speed. Likely, it is the onset of age and
all the declines that brings with it but I reserve much of the
blame for mumbling actors and actresses and, particularly, the
British.
</P>
<P>
   This now is compounded with the discovery, delighted though I
might be, that the British Broadcasting Company has invaded the
American market, establishing the BBC America channel which I
receive through my tiny satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   I spent much of last weekend watching BBC America and, having
been often to the United Kingdom, was familiar with much of its
programming, notably its newscasts which, unlike so many U.S.
newscasts, devotes its time more to world affairs than to
Madonna's.
</P>
<P>
   There is a request I would like to make, however: Subtitles. The
playwright George Bernard Shaw often was quoted as saying that the
British and Americans ``are two countries separated by a common
language.'' Likely, Shaw intended that in the use of words and
idioms (we do have a voluminous number of dissimilar terms) but
it's the pronunciation that wipes me out.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that someone from Liverpool would have a terrible time
trying to understand the Southern inflections of Tennessee
Williams' ``Cat On a Hot Tin Roof'' and that's the way I am with
``Fawlty Towers'' and the old ``Benny Hill'' reruns. I miss about
one-third of what is being said but make up for it with the
tremendous sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having an entire channel of Briticisms, pronounced any
number of ways (no country so small should have that many varied
accents) I am appealing for some relief. I am a big fan of foreign
films inasmuch as we supposedly get only the best of what the world
produces. If you're watching a French, Chinese or Iranian film, you
get subtitles and you can understand what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with a British or Aussie film. There are no subtitles and
you sit in the theater turning to your partner to find out if he or
she understood a word of what just was said. I couldn't make it
through ``Howard's End,'' not because the film was deadly dull in
of itself, but because I couldn't understand a single syllable of
what was being said.
</P>
<P>
   I find it interesting that I can understand every word of what
is being said by the anchors and reporters of BBC World News but
hardly a word of those ``down-home'' Britcoms where the characters
sit around sipping their pints and utle.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, I watched hours of something called ``The Royle
Family'' and hardly knew what they were saying. Then came World
News and I was back on track. Obviously, the news department has
higher pronunciation standards than does the entertainment
division.
</P>
<P>
   I have a great deal of experience with this as I have British
family which I visit almost yearly. We often have a hard time
understanding one another. If it is not the pronunciation, it's the
terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Several months ago, in London, I mentioned to the
family that my grandson was going to enter college this Fall.
``Brilliant!,'' exclaimed cousin Joanne. ``Well, I wouldn't say he
was brilliant, but he's a smart kid,'' I told her. ``No,'' she came
back, ``Brilliant! Wonderful! You know?''
</P>
<P>
   That's terminology. Pronunciation is another barrier to our
cross-Atlantic relationship. Particularly when cousin Simon's
friend Adam is around. He speaks much like Eliza Doolittle did when
Prof. Higgins first found her in Covent Garden. I'd do better with
Adam if he wrote down on paper what he was trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   But, I digress. BBC America needs to do America, and itself, a
favor if it hopes to be successful here. It needs to throw
subtitles onto those sitcoms and dramas. While ``Masterpiece
Theater'' is outstanding drama, it needs a little help in the
accent department for the American ear.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I caught Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' on
one of the U.S. movie channels. If it had not been for the fact
that I could use the closed caption feature on my TV set, I would
have been out of luck; massive mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, BBC America does not yet come with closed
captions (except for a couple of American commercials) and I would
urge it to do so quickly, for my sake and for its.

BETTER NOT TO RISK THE RISKS AND WAIT FOR PENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. My husband is wrestling with a dilemma involving a small
pension. Is he better off leaving the money where it is, or would
he be better off to cash in now and invest the proceeds in mutual
funds?
</P>
<P>
   P.G., Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the odds are he would be better off waiting for the
pension payments.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math I did: If he were to take the $6,500 and invest
it in a mutual fund portfolio that averaged 10 percent annual
returns, he would accumulate $10,693 after five years. If he then
began withdrawing $170 a month and returns remained at 10 percent,
the account would be depleted after 89 1/2 months, just less than 7
1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if he takes the cash, he will shoulder the risk that
comes with investing in stocks and stock funds. With a long bull
market behind us, I am not sanguine about getting short-term
returns from stocks in the neighborhood of 10 percent. So my guess
is that the odds are higher that the account would be depleted
before 7 1/2 years, rather than after. If he takes the pension,
there is minimal risk.
</P>
<P>
   That risk involves the terms of the pension. Would the $170 a
month be paid only as long as he is living, or in the event of his
death would it be paid to you? If both of you were to pass away,
would the remaining payments end, or would they go to your estate?
Do either of you face any predictable health risk that makes you
particularly unlikely to reach age 75? If I were you, I would
consider the answers to these questions _ and then probably wait
for the pension.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I expect to retire at age 65 if good health and the job
market permits, and at age 62 if I'm in poor health. I am acutely
aware of the inflation factor, which means my current funds will be
worth about one-half of what they are now in 10 years or so. I am
running out of time and must overcome my fear of investing so that
I can add to the existing balance and buying power. My last
full-time job ended in 1998 and I have been having trouble finding
another permanent full-time job. I expect to be divorced soon, but
that should not affect my finances either way.
</P>
<P>
   H.B., Garden Grove, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. The inflation factor isn't quite as bad as you imagine. If
inflation runs at 3.5 percent, you will need $141.06 in 10 years to
buy what $100 buys today. On the other hand, a huge amount of your
money _ $98,980 _ is doing little or nothing for you. If your
checking account is a NOW account, you are probably getting a
nominal interest return, but that $31,400 in the safe deposit box
is simply rotting. I calculated your total portfolio return at 4.4
percent, after making a estimate of a 2 percent yield on your
checking account balance. You can do a great deal better than that
without assuming any more risk.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I suggest you begin by calculating just how much
you really need in emergency savings, perhaps tallying 50 percent
of your annual living expenses. Whatever that figure comes to, that
should be the maximum left either in your checking account or in a
money market fund. I would suggest a maximum $5,000 target balance
for your checking account, and obviously you want the rest of it in
the money fund with the higher yield.
</P>
<P>
   Then scour out that safe deposit box. Put this in carefully
chosen CDs. Then, as your various current CDs mature, replace them
with the new CDs. By carefully selected CDs, I mean CDs that are at
or near the nation's highest interest rate at the time you purchase
them. Currently the best CD rates in the nation are 7.91 percent
for a five-year Jumbo CD. A jumbo is a CD of at least $100,000.
Limit each CD account to that $100,000, so you will enjoy the
maximum FDIC insurance on the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, all I have done is suggest you move from poor and
mediocre cash-type investments. That is partly because I don't like
to suggest that people who have developed very conservative saving
patterns make dramatic changes, and partly because I think moving a
large amount of money into the stock markets at this time
represents a significant risk.
</P>
<P>
   But what I do suggest is that you open a mutual fund account for
your ongoing savings. Try to figure out how much you can save from
your earnings and establish a regular monthly amount to contribute
to a conservative mutual fund account. What I suggest for you is a
balanced fund _ these funds balance a stock portfolio that is
typically 60 to 65 percent of their assets with a portfolio of
bonds representing the balance. Excellent examples of funds in this
category are Vanguard Balanced Index, and Fidelity Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   Why would I be comfortable advising that your ongoing savings go
into a vehicle dominated by stocks while I am leery of moving your
current investments to stocks? Because what I am suggesting is a
discipline called dollar-cost averaging. By this plan, you
establish a set amount and shovel it into your investment at
specific predetermined periods, regardless of the state of the
market. When the market is low, it means you are buying cheaper
shares, thus bringing your average cost per share down. When the
market is up _ well, that's why you established the account in the
first place. You should expect long-term returns in the
neighborhood of 8 to 9 percent from a balanced fund account.
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford to pay the taxes and forego the deduction you
would be entitled to on a contribution to a traditional IRA, I
suggest the first $2,000 you save each year go into a Roth IRA in
your balanced fund. If you think the tax deduction would be
important, then put your first $2,000 of savings into a traditional
IRA in the fund. You could then open a taxable account in the fund
for additional savings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 35 and single and have a 401(k) account and some small
investments for my retirement. I don't make a lot of money but
would like to start tucking away a few dollars every month to help
my best friend's daughter go to college. What are the options for
setting up this fund? I'd like to limit the taxes I'll pay on the
money, even if it is just on the earned interest. I'd also like to
make sure the child won't have to pay a lot of taxes when the money
is transferred to her.
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think the logical starting point would be to
establish an Education IRA for the child, in which you could
deposit up to $500 a year. Provided the money is used for
educational expenses, it can be withdrawn with no tax liability at
all. Anybody can contribute to an Education IRA, provided the
contributor's modified adjusted gross income doesn't exceed
$110,000 for an individual or $160,000 for a joint return. There is
no tax deduction for contributions to an Education IRA.
</P>
<P>
   You should also note that the $500 maximum annual contribution
to an IRA applies to the child and not to the donor, so you should
make sure the parents are not using this vehicle before you go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback to the Education IRA is that the amount in it
would be factored in if the student applies for financial aid.
Still, from the student's standpoint, it's a gift, and a handsome
one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose you decide to hit the midpoint of your anticipated
gifts, at $75 a month. This would mean you would have to save the
other $400 a year in some other vehicle. This could be deposited in
an account in the child's name, with yourself or the child's
parents as custodian. But such savings would enjoy no tax break,
and, again, they would work against the child in applications for
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule of thumb, unless the family of the child is
staggeringly rich, is not to put college savings in the student's
name. In this case, since the assets of the parents are considered
as a factor in determining the eligibility for financial
assistance, it would probably be better if you saved that
additional $400 a year in your own name.
</P>
<P>
   As for an investment vehicle, you have a broad choice, ranging
from CDs to mutual funds to stock brokerage accounts. If I were
doing it I would go with a plain vanilla stock fund, such as
Vanguard's Index 500. Vanguard will allow an Education IRA to be
opened with a $500 minimum deposit, so you would have to save
elsewhere for a while until you could make the first contribution.

WHERE YOUR DOLLAR IS ON THE BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I still get wistful at the thought of the TV ads Mercata.com ran
this spring: A fast-talking auctioneer accepts lower and lower bids
as giddy buyers race to lock in the rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   If only auctions _ or e-commerce _ really worked that way.
</P>
<P>
   They don't, of course, even for collective-buying companies such
as Mercata. Such sites offer volume discounts to Web-heads who come
together and place orders en masse, but that's hardly the same
thing as having companies bid down prices just for little old you.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, life imitates art. Or at least artful
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Web sites recently began promoting themselves as
``reverse-auction,'' ``upside-down auction,'' or
``reverse-marketplace'' services. Regardless of the name, the idea
is pretty much the same in every case. (And it looks a lot like the
Mercata advertisement, if not the Mercata.com service.)
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the sites turn the normal auction process on its
head. Rather than having buyers bid on items listed by sellers,
these services have sellers compete to fill orders submitted by
individual buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new sites focus on small businesses
(www.bizbuyer.com and www.onvia.com, for example); others target
niche audiences (such as www.improvenet.com and www.teetime.com).
But the best are geared to replacing the yellow pages as the place
everyday folks can go to find local service providers _ a plumber,
say, or a mechanic to work on your '67 Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is fairly simple: You go to one of these sites, type in
your ZIP code along with what you want and how much you're willing
to pay, and then you sit back and wait for local companies to beat
a path to your e-mailbox. Some sites even provide information on
providers' track records on customer service to help you sift
through the offers.
</P>
<P>
   How many of the reverse-auction sites will survive remains to be
seen, but the market is huge. Services represent more than 70
percent of the US economy, and local services represent one of the
gaping holes in the Web. Sites that can tap into that are likely to
make money for themselves, while saving time and cash for the rest
of us. (Businesses typically pay a percentage of sales they
generate from site referrals.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the early contenders:
</P>
<P>
   _ www.eFrenzy.com, unlike some of the other sites, is focused
almost exclusively on the consumer market for local services. It
features 10 categories of service providers, with dozens of
subcategories, ranging from career counseling to dog-walking.
</P>
<P>
   To use the site, you first have to take five or 10 minutes to
register. As these things go, it isn't overly intrusive or
time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of eFrenzy is that you can read or post
reviews of service providers. And a la Web-auction pioneer eBay,
the directory of past reviews helps future clients decide whom to
do business with.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.eWanted.com works on a different principle. Rather than
send your request to professionals who can bid on it, eWanted posts
it (anonymously, of course) for the whole world to see. Anyone who
wants to fill the request is invited to send an e-mail reply.
</P>
<P>
   The variation creates a very different type of site. People on
the site are looking to buy all kinds of things, from rare books to
commercial real estate. Personal services have a place, also, but
it's a smaller piece of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback at this stage appears to be traffic _ or
lack of it. The day I stopped by, the vast majority of the requests
had received few e-mail responses, and even fewer real bids.
</P>
<P>
   --www.imandi.com, like eWanted, focuses on a host of areas other
than local services. Unlike eWanted, though, Imandi has more than
200,000 service providers in its nationwide network.
</P>
<P>
   When I typed in my Boston-area ZIP code, for example, the site
informed me that it could put my work out to bid to 15 contractors
who could repair my fence, or 14 services that could clean my
house.
</P>
<P>
   Imandi will e-mail your request to the companies you want to
bid, post the request on the site for all comers, or both. It also
features a helpful ``buyers guide'' that tells you what questions
to ask different types of providers and how to choose someone.
</P>
<P>
   --www.respond.com is an interesting reverse-auction site, but
it's thin on local services. You can submit requests for
photographers, mechanics, and a few types of repairmen, but the
site is mostly dedicated to hooking up buyers and sellers of
hard-to-find things such as out-of-print albums or Gothic-style
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   If the site does have a category for what you want, though, it's
not a bad option. Respond.com is simple to use, and it provides the
opportunity to swap information with people and professionals,
whether or not you find a seller of the service in question.
</P>
<P>
   --www.SimplyDone.com isn't really a reverse-auction site, though
it accomplishes much the same thing. Instead, it's the best of the
matchmaker sites, which will pair you with local service providers
_ but it won't put your job out to bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give you the phone numbers and rates for each service,''
said spokeswoman Lynn Hackman. ``You could always call them to
negotiate something lower, based on what you found on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   I like SimplyDone.com because it's easy to use, it's focused on
local services exclusively, and it partners with the Better
Business Bureaus and the San Francisco-based Value Star system to
evaluate service providers in its network.
</P>
<P>
   Relaunched last month with a new name (it used to be
Handshake.com), the site features eight categories: house cleaning,
carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, pest control, massage
therapy, pet grooming, oil change, and limousine or car service.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bucking all predictions, US venture capital deals notched a new
record in the second quarter, as companies landed $19.58 billion in
financing, 14 percent more than in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies reaping funds inched up 1 percent, to
1,432, according to the Boston Globe-PricewaterhouseCoopers Money
Tree Survey. If venture capitalists showed a reluctance to quicken
their deal pace on the heels of the April technology stock dive,
they weren't stingy with their money: The average funding round
rose 13 percent to $13.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   New England remained the most active region after Silicon
Valley, as local startups grabbed 13.3 percent of the funds
invested nationally, or a record $2.61 billion, up from $2.42
billion in the first quarter. Silicon Valley claimed 35.1 percent
of total venture funding, or $6.87 billion, while the Southeast
ranked third, at 7.8 percent, or $1.54 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest sector in New England was telecommunications,
outpacing software, networking, and other technology sectors for
the first time in the survey's history, while consumer and
business-to-business financings sagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The b-to-b bloom has fallen off,'' said Bill Collatos,
managing general partner at Spectrum Equity Investors in Boston.
``People are now focused on the reality that b-to-b is only as
effective as the infrastructure that supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming demand for telecommunications services _ from voice
and data lines to wireless technology _ is seen as a vast
investment opportunity for at least another five years. Consumers
around Boston were reminded last week of how integral these
services have become, as the workers' strike at Verizon
Communications made it harder to get directory assistance, new
lines, or repairs on modem hook-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, data traffic has taken over voice traffic on
the nation's telecommunications systems with the soaring use of the
Internet. Three years from now, data is expected to account for as
much as 70 percent of all the traffic, said Sanjay Mewada, director
of telecom/e-business analysis at the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tree,'' Mewada explained. ``As the trunk gets
bigger, the branches get bigger, and the connection points have to
become faster and more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of young companies scrambling to tackle this
problem, many of them led by former executives of Lucent
Technologies, AT&AMP;T, MCI, and the former Baby Bells. Fiberoptics _
light signals pulsing through glass fibers _ are attracting big
money, as are wireless technologies. And all the companies have
different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Bridge Communications of North Andover received $102.5
million of third-round financing in the second quarter, the
second-biggest funding the Bay State has seen. A Wallingford,
Conn., fiberoptics company, Cidra Corp., reaped $100 million, while
four other Massachusetts companies involved in communications
received more than $50 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Gray, a Boston partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers'
Technology Industry Group, marveled at the super-size deals being
inked in the region _ more than double the biggest financings 12
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some companies may be recasting the way they
describe themselves to shed the unfashionable Internet category and
fit into telecom. At the same time, he said, ``The true telecom
companies need a lot more money than Internet companies do to
succeed.'' Such spending goes largely to hardware, research and
development, and building out networks.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Bridge has just leased 100,000 square feet of new space
in Andover, more than tripling its current 30,000 square feet in
North Andover. The company has grown from 90 employees at the end
of 1999 to 220 now, and it expects that count to hit 300 by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Zona, Quantum's chief executive, said raising money has
been relatively easy. The company is backed by big name VCs,
including Atlas Venture, BancBoston Capital, New Enterprise
Associates, and Texas Pacific Group, among many others. He thinks
venture capitalists are betting heavily in the sector because
revenues and profits are clearly in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two technologies will be left standing _ optical
technology and wireless,'' Zona said. ``If you want capacity and
you want a high-speed experience, you're only going to get that
through optical technology.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barry, senior editor of Venture Capital &AMP; Information
Technology, a Wellesley-based trade journal, said part of the
allure of the communications companies for investors is that they
are attractive buyout candidates for the telecom giants, from Cisco
Systems Inc. and Lucent to Nortel Networks Corp. and Sycamore
Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions are coming earlier in the startups' lives and
at big premiums, Barry observed. ``You can start a company and
throw a few million dollars into it, and a Nortel will come along
and pay a billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Nortel has done a string of acquisitions. In July,
it agreed to buy Alteon WebSystems, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., for
$7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If telecom enjoyed an embarrassment of riches in the second
quarter, the Web darlings of late 1999 went begging.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet-related companies nationwide saw their funding
rise 7.5 percent to $11.67 billion in the quarter, service
companies and applications players garnered the biggest share of
that money. Content sites, business-to-business companies and
e-commerce sites lost their luster after the April stock-market
dive and saw their financings drop off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sector rotation has been really, really fast,'' said Geoff
Yang, founding partner of Redpoint Ventures in Silicon Valley,
during a conference call hosted by the National Venture Capital
Association. ``There's no question that the shift in the public
markets has caused a shift in where VCs invest.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering window had closed abruptly in April
and May, sparking fears that venture capitalists would fund fewer
companies if they couldn't take other companies in their portfolios
public. But the IPO market has since rebounded to record levels _
and the venture money keeps flowing, but into different sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Top IPOs in the second quarter included Sonus Networks, a
Westford voice-infrastructure products company, which has soared a
stunning 763 percent. StorageNetworks Inc., a Waltham data storage
player, has seen its stock jump 330 percent, while shares of
Charles River Laboratories Holdings Inc., a Wilmington drug
development company, have risen 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, $36.7 billion of venture investments
nationwide have outpaced all of 1999, when $35.6 billion was
invested. Analysts and people who work with venture capitalists
said while the pace remained vigorous, deals were being done in
less haste than in the prior two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of investing feels less frantic than it did last
quarter,'' said Jesse Reyes, a vice president with venture
economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to worry that communications is overheating, just as
b-to-c and b-to-b did? That time could be just around the corner,
pros warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems all the momentum money is moving into
communications,'' Yang said. If the financing trend follows what
happened in the Internet arena, copycat companies will soon start
to surface, trying to muscle in on hot sectors. ``We haven't seen
that yet,'' Yang said. ``But it wouldn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Collatos of Spectrum said surely all the telecom startups won't
make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these companies are being acquired on promise, not
proven revenues,'' he said. ``That sounds remarkably like the
Internet environment of the last three years.''

 `MARRIAGE PENALTY' RAISES CONSCIOUSNESS, IF NOT IRE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DEDHAM, Mass. _ As Allison Hazen stood on a platform getting
fitted for her wedding gown, she and bridal shop owner Rachelle
Avola talked about love, finances, and the so-called marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``When filing jointly, you're definitely getting hit hard with a
higher tax rate,'' said Hazen, 29, an attorney and budget director
for a member of the state Senate Ways and Means Committee, as Avola
took up the hem of her white jacquard gown.
</P>
<P>
   The longstanding tax arose by historical accident and now
penalizes about 50 to 60 percent of married couples, particularly
those with both husband and wife earning paychecks. Last month,
Congress passed a bill to reduce the tax, but last Saturday
President Clinton vetoed it as poorly targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Like the millions of couples affected every year, Hazen and her
fiance, also a lawyer, aren't letting the tax get in the way of
love and romance; they're walking down the aisle next month. And,
like many other soon-to-be married couples, they haven't taken any
special financial steps to minimize the impact of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know about budgets and know about the tax, and you're
not doing anything about it, I bet other young people wouldn't,
either,'' Avola told Hazen as she trimmed and pinned the gown at
her shop, Emma's of Dedham, which has been in business under
various owners since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the marriage tax _ which takes an estimated $29
billion from about 20 million married couples' pockets each year _
has reached a feverish pitch in Washington this presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's veto of the marriage tax cut bill, Republicans
say they will bring up the issue again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The quirk in the US tax code that now creates a marriage penalty
_ income splitting between husband and wife _ first went on the
books in 1948 and actually served as a marriage subsidy for most
couples until 1969. Back when most couples had only one breadwinner
_ the husband _ splitting the income between husband and wife meant
being taxed in a lower bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1969, with changes in tax laws and the growing number
of women in the work force, married couples have been increasingly
penalized, with a record proportion now having to pay hundreds to
thousands of dollars a year more than they would have, had they
stayed single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does send a kind of odd message from the government _ `You
should pay extra taxes if you get married,' '' said Daniel
Feenberg, a research associate for the Cambridge-based National
Bureau of Economic Research who has studied the marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Congressional Budget Office report on marriage and the
federal income tax found that between 1969 and 1995, the proportion
of working-age married couples with both spouses earning paychecks
jumped from 48.4 percent to 71.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some married couples still get a subsidy today, however _ those
in which only one spouse works, or those with a big difference
between the incomes of the two spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Why are some couples penalized while others are subsidized? It
has to do with the progressive nature of the US tax rates. When two
spouses work, their combined incomes could kick them up into a
higher marginal tax bracket. When only one earns a paycheck, the
income is split, allowing more of the money to be taxed at lower
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think progressivity is an important value and marriage
neutrality is an important value,'' said research associate
Feenberg. ``All these things have to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a presidential election year, of course, talking about a
marriage tax cut wins out over discussing the progressive tax
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say they will bring up the marriage tax issue
again when Congress returns from its August recess. The Republicans
probably won't have enough votes to override Clinton's veto and
would need to revise their $292 billion marriage tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and most Democrats objected to the bill as benefiting
higher-income families and couples already getting a marriage
subsidy, and have offered alternatives. In his veto statement,
Clinton also criticized the Republican-controlled Congress for
failing to use the projected budget surplus to strengthen Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how government works, bride-to-be Hazen didn't plan her
wedding around the election-year marriage tax debate or change her
financial plans in other ways because of the impending tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are steps you can take, like changing the timing
of your wedding,'' she said, and increasing 401(k) contributions or
making a deductible Individual Retirement Account contribution if
you qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said she and her fiance have also thought about buying a
house, which would give them a mortgage-interest deduction that
``definitely offsets the higher tax rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Avola, of Emma's of Dedham, said business is strong this year,
with lots of couples taking their vows, marriage tax or not. ``It's
the millennium bug and the love bug,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That bug will be in full force Wednesday at Filene's Basement in
Downtown Crossing, where hundreds of brides-to-be will rush the
store's annual 8 a.m. bridal gown sale, marriage tax be damned.
</P>
<P>
   While most people are like Hazen and don't take tax-minimizing
steps before they take their vows, emerging economics research and
anecdotal evidence suggest there are some people who will go to
lengths to avoid or minimize the marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   One series of studies has found that some people will delay or
even forgo marriage because of the tax, while others will divorce
in part because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tended to find in all this is that economic
incentives _ including taxes _ matter,'' said James Alm, chairman
of the economics department at Georgia State's Andrew Young School
of Policy Studies, who has coauthored studies on the tax's impact
on marriage and divorce with Leslie Whittington of Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of people, it's not a big response,'' Alm said.
For most people, ``other things seem to explain the marriage
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at
the University of Michigan Business School, said the research
literature suggests even the most tax-conscious people still will
marry, although they may wed in January instead of December to gain
another year penalty-free.
</P>
<P>
   The literature shows similar timing decisions made by the
tax-conscious, said Slemrod, coauthor of the book ``Taxing
Ourselves: A Citizen's Guide to the Great Debate over Tax Reform.''
Such decisions encompass everything from the best month to have a
baby (December, to get a full year's tax deduction), to the best
month to sell stock (depends on whether you're realizing a loss or
trying to hold on to a profitable stock long enough for the lower,
long-term capital gains rate, among other factors).
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Crannage, owner of Gowns by Elizabeth in Stoneham,
said she averages about half a dozen brides a year who consciously
marry in January rather than December. Crannage, who makes and
designs wedding gowns, said many of her customers are lawyers and
other professionals who know about the tax impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk a lot about taxes and about being married and the
financial consequences,'' said Crannage. ``It can cost quite a bit
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her clients, Maureen Burke, 34, said, ``I definitely
wouldn't get married on Dec. 31. That would definitely enter into
my mind. For the sake of one day, you'd get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burke, who works in the financial services industry, and her
husband, who's in computer software, didn't marry in January,
either. Instead, they chose to wed in autumn, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has friends who've said they didn't want to get married
because of the tax hit. ``I've heard that more than once,'' she
said, although many have since wed.
</P>
<P>
   The current marriage tax debate highlights such ongoing tax
policy considerations as whether taxation should reflect social
changes, be used in an attempt to shape behavior, or be used to
simply raise revenues in as equitable a way as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, tax policy just comes down to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1948, when the US tax code first allowed income
splitting, subsidizing most married couples in those days, the
change came not from the federal government wanting husbands to
work and wives to stay at home. It came in response to some states
adopting community property laws that allowed income splitting,
according to tax historians.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1948, individuals were separately taxed on their own
incomes, whether married or not. Some tax policy specialists favor
returning to that as a way to address the current inequity of some
married couples getting a subsidy while other married couples and
singles don't.
</P>
<P>
   If taxation were just about raising revenues and not about
making a social or political statement, the federal government
could take in between $300 million to $1.3 billion more through the
marriage tax if it were to recognize gay and lesbian couples as
legally married, according to a study in the National Tax Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Badgett, assistant professor of economics at the University
of Massachusetts, Amherst, and coauthor of the study with tax
researchers Alm and Whittington, became interested in this topic as
a result of the debate over same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In their calling for legal recognition of same-sex marriages,
``Gay and lesbian people are wanting to have access to more
rights,'' such as the spousal health benefits that heterosexual
married couples receive, Badgett said. But as her study shows,
``There's a financial downside to getting married.''
</P>
<P>
   A cut in the marriage tax ``benefits me potentially, so that's
good,'' said Hazen, as she finished her wedding gown fitting at
Emma's of Dedham. But she also knows there are other needs the
federal government must weigh in considering any tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   For Hazen, who knows about the financial downside that will come
with her September marriage, the marriage tax is worthy of debate.

   While most couples pay more taxes after marriage than when
single, some get a tax subsidy, particularly if only one spouse
works. A bill passed last month by Congress would have lowered the
marriage tax for most couples now facing a penalty, but also would
have given even more of a break to those who already receive a
subsidy. President Clinton vetoed the bill Aug. 5, saying it was
poorly targeted and demanding that his alternatives be considered.
Republicans say they will bring the issue up again when Congress
returns from recess.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a comparison of hypothetical scenarios under the 1999 tax
rules and what Congress had proposed for 2000. The marriage penalty
reflects how much more in taxes the two-earner couple pays,
compared with being single and being taxed on their income
separately. The marriage subsidy reflects how much less in taxes
the one-earner couple pays compared with a single person with the
same income.

 &HT;    FIXES THROUGHOUT
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: There's English, and there's English
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of times my wife and I turn to each other to ask,
``What did he say?'' during the viewing of a TV program or movie is
increasing with alarming speed. Likely, it is the onset of age and
all the declines that brings with it but I reserve much of the
blame for mumbling actors and actresses and, particularly, the
British.
</P>
<P>
   This now is compounded with the discovery, delighted though I
might be, that the British Broadcasting Company has invaded the
American market, establishing the BBC America channel which I
receive through my tiny satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   I spent much of last weekend watching BBC America and, having
been often to the United Kingdom, was familiar with much of its
programming, notably its newscasts which, unlike so many U.S.
newscasts, devotes its time more to world affairs than to
Madonna's.
</P>
<P>
   There is a request I would like to make, however: Subtitles. The
playwright George Bernard Shaw often was quoted as saying that the
British and Americans ``are two countries separated by a common
language.'' Likely, Shaw intended that in the use of words and
idioms (we do have a voluminous number of dissimilar terms) but
it's the pronunciation that wipes me out.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that someone from Liverpool would have a terrible time
trying to understand the Southern inflections of Tennessee
Williams' ``Cat On a Hot Tin Roof'' and that's the way I am with
``Fawlty Towers'' and the old ``Benny Hill'' reruns. I miss about
one-third of what is being said but make up for it with the
tremendous sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having an entire channel of Briticisms, pronounced any
number of ways (no country so small should have that many varied
accents) I am appealing for some relief. I am a big fan of foreign
films inasmuch as we supposedly get only the best of what the world
produces. If you're watching a French, Chinese or Iranian film, you
get subtitles and you can understand what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with a British or Aussie film. There are no subtitles and
you sit in the theater turning to your partner to find out if he or
she understood a word of what just was said. I couldn't make it
through ``Howard's End,'' not because the film was deadly dull in
of itself, but because I couldn't understand a single syllable of
what was being said.
</P>
<P>
   I find it interesting that I can understand every word of what
is being said by the anchors and reporters of BBC World News but
hardly a word of those ``down-home'' Britcoms where the characters
sit around sipping their pints and uttering indecipherable babble.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, I watched hours of something called ``The Royle
Family'' and hardly knew what they were saying. Then came World
News and I was back on track. Obviously, the news department has
higher pronunciation standards than does the entertainment
division.
</P>
<P>
   I have a great deal of experience with this as I have British
family which I visit almost yearly. We often have a hard time
understanding one another. If it is not the pronunciation, it's the
terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Several months ago, in London, I mentioned to the
family that my grandson was going to enter college this Fall.
``Brilliant!,'' exclaimed cousin Joanne. ``Well, I wouldn't say he
was brilliant, but he's a smart kid,'' I told her. ``No,'' she came
back, ``Brilliant! Wonderful! You know?''
</P>
<P>
   That's terminology. Pronunciation is another barrier to our
cross-Atlantic relationship. Particularly when cousin Simon's
friend Adam is around. He speaks much like Eliza Doolittle did when
Prof. Higgins first found her in Covent Garden. I'd do better with
Adam if he wrote down on paper what he was trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   But, I digress. BBC America needs to do America, and itself, a
favor if it hopes to be successful here. It needs to throw
subtitles onto those sitcoms and dramas. While ``Masterpiece
Theater'' is outstanding drama, it needs a little help in the
accent department for the American ear.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I caught Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' on
one of the U.S. movie channels. If it had not been for the fact
that I could use the closed caption feature on my TV set, I would
have been out of luck; massive mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, BBC America does not yet come with closed
captions (except for a couple of American commercials) and I would
urge it to do so quickly, for my sake and for its.

 &HT;    The sign-guy and old Perotnistas
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Everyone but the most hardened partisans
have decried the staged, empty, smiley-faced conventions of the
major parties. Commentators of all stripes have wished out loud for
the old days of platform fights, credential challenges, delegate
walkouts and red-meat oratory that lambastes the bad guys, exalts
the good and whips the faithful into spear-shaking battle
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Well, be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we got to see an old-fashioned
thrash-it-out-in-public convention. It wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party was in full hoot and holler. If some of the
delegates weren't so cranky and scary, it would have been
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   We also have something I've never heard anyone wish for _ twice
as many Reform Parties. The delegates opposing Pat Buchanan walked
out and held their own convention 100 yards down the street.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why. Buchanan did not win over the Reform
Party; he used it as a host organism. He infected it until he
emerged screaming from its abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   On the first night of the Buchanan-Reformed Reform Party
convention, delegates were shown a campaign video of the candidate.
(Bizarrely, it used a reworked version of ``When You Say Nothing at
All'' as a campaign song. A title that seems more fitting for
George W. Bush than Buchanan.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the video's big applause moments was a clip of Buchanan's
defiant, post-Watergate defense of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this. Here is a party founded first and foremost on
cleaning up government and containing the power of special
interests. And now its new members are cheering the memory of
Nixon. Kind of weird.
</P>
<P>
   And kind of sad.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot that was goofy, grating and grandiose about the
original Reform Party. But I have a soft place in my heart for it.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't feel this until the close of the 1996 election when
Ross Perot signs began popping up around town. Not the usual slick,
mass-produced signs. But crude, hand-lettered, red-white-and-blue,
signs painted on scraps of plywood. They just said ``Perot'' with
big black-outlined white stars and sometimes red circles.
</P>
<P>
   And not in the usual political-sign places. In odd places.
Fences on the edge of pine woods. Lonely country roads. In vacant
lots on U.S. 1. Nailed high up on telephone poles suggesting
someone had climbed up hammer in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The election ended and Bill Clinton began his second term. But
the signs kept appearing. All winter long. It was as though the
sign guy couldn't bear to admit it was over. He had to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   There was something very poignant about these folk-art,
wavy-lettered Perot signs standing alone, often in the middle of
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   For me, they suggested the intense, personal and doomed
sentiments behind the old Reform Party and made me stop snickering
at it.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious sign guy and his allies were people who felt that
politics, politicians and their very nation were passing them by as
though they didn't matter. And this strange party offered them just
a little hope for keeping these dark forces at bay. They threw
their hearts and leftover plywood scraps into it.
</P>
<P>
   With the Buchanan takeover, these are the people who will likely
drift away from politics and even voting. The party that was the
handiwork of their hopes will die the slow death of court appeals,
ballot-eligibility rulings and splinter parties. The Reform Party
is all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought I'd say this, but I will miss it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine anyone painstakingly applying acrylic paint to
plywood and driving back roads at night to climb telephone poles on
behalf of Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And the political process will be poorer for it.

 &HT;    The sounds of silence lost
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ Listen carefully and tell me what you hear.
Car horns? Power lawn mowers? An '81 Oldsmobile excreting trash-rap
through its open windows?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to any one of the above, or heaven forbid,
all of them, then you're probably an average Joe, living on Main
Street, Anywhere, USA. And you're pretty used to the cacophony
we've come to accept as a part of our daily
</P>
<P>
   lives, not even noticing until it turns up missing.
</P>
<P>
   A while back, I read of a tribe of natives living in a jungle _
can't remember exactly where...maybe South America, maybe Africa,
definitely not New York _ whose hearing was so acute they could
carry on conversations with each
</P>
<P>
   other even though they were the equivalent of a football field
apart _ and without raising their voices. No market for Miracle Ear
here.
</P>
<P>
   But not so in the civilized (that's supposed to be us) world.
Most of the folks I know are lucky to hear well enough to find the
cordless phone ringing under a pile of laundry where they left it
the last time they used it, much less chat with a friend who is not
electronically connected.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of impairment, don't you just love having to say
everything twice? Not so much because you weren't heard the first
time, but because you have been tuned out along with ``shriek TV''
and the Cuisinart?
</P>
<P>
   I have a dear friend who spent too many years around heavy
construction equipment, rendering conversation with him an exercise
in futility. That's frustrating, particularly when it was only
trivia to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Example: We're driving down a country road in his pickup and I
point out my window and comment on the passing cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Knee high by the fourth of July. Looking pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Him: ``Hmmh?''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``The corn. It's just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Him: ``Say again.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``THE CORN. IT'S LOOKING GOOD.''
</P>
<P>
   Him: ``What corn?'' Naturally, he doesn't see any corn because
by the time he's heard what I'm saying we're in the next county _
where they only grow soybeans. He can't help it. It's what happens
when we live in a strident world, but when I mention hearing aid he
goes ballistic. ``I CAN HEAR JUST FINE,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Noise, according to Webster, is defined as a nonharmonious or
discordant group of sounds. Silence is the glorious absence of all
that.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what's happening around me this early morning at a
friend's house on Cape Cod. The stillness outside Gail's open study
door, where I happen to be working, is interrupted only by the
chatter of birds and the tinkle of the little bell Puss Puss's
mistress has strung onto her collar to warn the wildlife of a
well-fed, but nonetheless predatory creature lurking in the hostas.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Grandfather, the 9-foot tall people-friendly
7-day clock Gail inherited from her Aunt Alice, ticks and chimes
its reminder of a gentler era. I think I can still remember going
to sleep by just such a sound when I
</P>
<P>
   was a little girl _ back when lawnmowers whooshed and purred on
summer lawns, and laughter, rather than canned heavy metal, drifted
from neighborhood porches.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. And silence, though still
golden, is also, unfortunately, rare.

</P>
<P>
   Street Fighter EX2 Plus ($35; www.capcom.com; for the
PlayStation) is maddening! Following in the steps of Capcom's
flagship Street Fighter series, Street Fighter EX2 Plus pulls you
into the fiercest brawls against some of the baddest characters on
the videogame block. Menacing fighters with moves like the Psycho
Crusher, the Atomic Suplex and the Death Press wreak mental anguish
and virtual pain on your character, forcing you to open up your own
little can of whip-butt. But no matter how many blows you land,
nine times out of 10 you're gonna lose when you play against the
PlayStation fighters. With its vivid 3-D graphics, rapid, smooth
animation and those nauseating grunts, groans and yelps so germane
to these types of fighting games, Street Fighter EX2 Plus will keep
you and your thumbs busy _ at least until you're too frustrated to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants to be a Millionaire 2nd Edition ($40; www.playstation
.com; for the PlayStation) tries to emulate the essence of
Philbin's game show phenomenon by adding a dramatic pregnant pause
every time you select your multiple choice answer. This is
aggravating in a PlayStation game where we suffer enough loading
delays as it is. Ironically, that's the best this game has to
offer. It's trivia with Regis Philbin doing some voice work _ and
most of that is just sampled from the actual show. Other than that,
there's almost nothing here remotely resembling a video game: The
graphic interface is sparse and cheap (you stare, alternately, at
two empty chairs, or text, or an empty set mock up). And the
capper: Questions must be answered within an allotted time frame;
unlike the show, contestants are not allowed to reminisce about the
7th grade school teacher who taught extensively on the subject; no
hemming and hawing, no repartee with the host. The nerve! Give me a
time limit and then preprogram a pregnant pause before telling me
if my rushed answer is right or wrong? Lame. Who thinks it's
possible to be a millionaire by starting out $40 in the hole and
that much further away from being a millionaire with nothing to
show for it except for ``branded consumer who doesn't deserve to be
a millionaire'' emblazoned on their forehead?
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say that the problem with Doom designer John
Romero's highly anticipated Daikatana ($40; www.daikatana.com; for
Windows) is that because it came along far later than promised,
truly great shooters like Unreal: Tournament and Half-Life arrived
in the meantime to leave it in the dust. And that's true. But the
real cruncher is that, though it bulges with visual flourishes and
mildly interesting weapons and monsters, the gameplay itself lies
along a spectrum from annoying to tiresome. It simply isn't much
fun. With ``save gems'' that must be tediously collected prior to
ending a session, maddeningly frustrating (but much-touted and
politically incorrect) sidekicks, laughable cinematics and
half-hearted (but seemingly endless) level designs, this story of
time-travel and swordplay offers little sparkle and no spark,
arriving stillborn after the long, long wait. Vampire: The
Masquerade _ Redemption ($45, www.activision.com; for Windows)
drops you into an immersive 3-D world where role-playing, action
and puzzle-solving are well balanced. That's the good news.
Creeping about in the shadows as the undead anti-hero Christof and
hacking away at one's enemies or drinking the blood of one's
victims is sinister fun. The smooth-running landscapes and special
effects are detailed and atmospheric. The controls are intuitive
(toggle between third- and first-person), the cinematic cut scenes
are lovely and the characters who join your party are interesting
and even helpful. But the most highly anticipated aspect of the
game, storyteller mode, in which one player builds and controls a
world as the game is running, disappoints in that it requires a
sure hand at the helm _ something difficult to find in the
twitchfest of the Internet _ and generally degenerates into a
free-for-all. But given the right circumstances _ a well-built LAN
game with all the players physically in a room together _ Vampire
has the potential for transcending even its worst glitches.

 &HT;    A pacifier with peace of mind
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Since my son prefers his thumb and did not take to those tried
and true ``face-plugs,'' as my wife and I like to call baby
pacifiers, I never got a chance to truly evaluate Mabis'
TenderTykes Digital Pacifier Thermometer ($10; www.mabis .net).
Instead, I stuck it in my own mouth, much to my son's delight, and
found that yup, it works, and yup, I feel silly. A nifty device as
relevant now as it was in the caveman days, the unit contains a
digital thermometer within an orthodontic nipple with a little,
easy-to-read liquid crystal display that does not require you to
remove the pacifier in order to see it. The device also has an
oxymoronic ``Lullaby Alarm'' should it detect a fever. It has
memory and will recall the last reading, too, so you can gauge
where exactly this fever may or may not be going. To be truly
effective, of course, the fevered wee one has to like face plugs in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   THE TOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
</P>
<P>
   Console games that appeal to both kids and adults and
notoriously difficult to produce. That's why it's such a breath of
fresh air to play Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue ($40;
www.sega.com; for the Sega Dreamcast), which appeals not just to
the gaming tyke but to the more mature gamer as well. The game,
featuring the original voice actors from ``Toy Story 2,'' uses
environments from the movie to create an immersive 3-D environment
that is only enhanced by the Dreamcast's graphic abilities.
Everything is sharp and gorgeous, as in the Pixar film. Controlling
Buzz as he navigates a playroom or the kitchen is a treat. If
there's one drawback it's that the wide range of controls and huge
environments can be a little intimidating _ you get to feel like a
tiny toy lost in an oversized world.

 &HT;    Sound with style

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Listening to music at work often involves wearing headphones so
as not to disturb your office- or cubicle-mates, but if you have
agreeable tastes or your own space, you might want to check out the
Monsoon iM-700 multimedia speakers ($170; www.monsoonpower.com).
The set, which comes with two flat desktop speakers, a powered
amplifier/subwoofer and a tiny ``puck'' for volume and mute
control, is perfect for a workstation _ the speakers are sleek and
take up little room on a desk. They also sound great, offering good
sound on a Mac or in Windows, whether its for music or games. In
Windows, however, there is a noticeable hiss when nothing is
playing. The speakers also require finicky positioning to sound
good and are sometimes a little too sibilant, especially when
playing CDs. But if style's your thing, you probably won't find a
better-looking set of speakers to impress your co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   BACK UP BEFORE YOU CRASH DOWN
</P>
<P>
   There are three rules to digital information fabrication: Back
up, back up, back up. It took a couple of hard crashes for this
axiom to sink in, but now, ever present at my cluttered workstation
is the stalwart and reliable Iomega Zip Drive. The USB Zip 100
($100; www.iomega.com) is particularly functional for me as it is
external and works for Windows and on Macs. Plus it's sleek and
portable. Though 100 MB of storage is smallish by today's
standards, it's more than adequate for typical duplicate document
desires. And because I'm lazy, the USB hot-swap deal allows me to
plug in and back up without rebooting. And because I'm
</P>
<P>
   into fruit, I particularly appreciate the translucent
blueberryish Mac look, even though my Mac isn't even remotely blue,
and my PC is decidedly colorless.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When you're hot, you're hot _ but you should
have some say in the matter. Consider then the Convair 900
``Prestige'' Evaporative Air Cooler ($300; www.convair.net.au). Not
to be confused with conventional air conditioners, evaporative
coolers employ a contrary, environmentally friendly means to
comfort-zone ends. Air is drawn through a large, wet filter pad by
a powerful (and distinctly audible) fan, a process similarly seen
in nature when air is cooled when it passes over an ocean or large
body of water. The Prestige holds up to four gallons of water and
has a tank gauge to monitor consumption. As a self-contained,
free-standing unit requiring only an AC power source, the Convair
900 Prestige does not require permanent installation of gaudy bulk.
It can be wheeled to any room as needed, including the storage shed
during the off-seasons. Essentially a humidifier, the Convair
Prestige is innately less effective in extremely humid climates,
but when it's simpatico with the environment, the Prestige is very
cool.

   ``Independence Day'' was certainly a resplendently overblown,
over-acted blockbuster extravaganza when it hit the theaters back
in 1996. Now you can see it all over again _ along with nine
additional minutes of fantastical footage _ in all its widescreen,
invading-alien glory. With optional running commentaries from
members of the production crew accompanying the first disc,
Independence Day Five Star Collection ($35; www.foxhome.com) also
includes a second DVD stuffed with features such as a ``making of''
ID4 documentary, a cheeky alien invasion ``mockumentry'' and an HBO
First Look featurette hosted by Jeff Goldblum, as well as deleted
scenes, outtakes, storyboards, concept art, production stills and
even a DVD-ROM game called ``Get Off My Planet'' playable directly
from one's DVD player.BARBECUER'S DECK HAND

<P>
   Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks? At one time or
another most grills become the source of a deck-top mess. Instead
of pressure washing wood or stone after every cookout, why not buy
a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill Pad ($25 to $40
depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little more than a pad
of thick, felt-like material coated in colored concrete. But it's
big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch rounds) to protect
the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from the garden hose.

 &HT;    Yahoo strikes a blow for free music
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Music lovers _ not to mention the lawyers and rock
groups who want to sue them _ will be intrigued by Yahoo's new
category listing: ``Digital Distribution.'' They'll especially love
the subcategory: ``Peer to Peer File Sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``peer to peer file sharing'' has a nice ring to it,
but essentially it's a high-class way of saying: ``Hey, everybody!
Here's a list of places where you can swap music online for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has a long and fairly comprehensive list of illegal places
to download music. It's a wonder the Recording Industry Association
of America hasn't filed suit against it for aiding and abetting
music-loving lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the infamous places to download music is Napster
(www.napster.com), an entirely free service with literally
thousands of songs available, and every single download is free.
</P>
<P>
   As the RIAA has been saying for some time, and as we all know by
now, downloading the kind of music you'll find on Internet sites
such as Napster and several others is illegal. It violates
copyright laws and all of the fair-use statutes _ and that's just
for starters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Peer to Peer File Sharing'' category lists 25 Web sites
where users can exchange music for free. One site, MyNapster
(www.mynapster.com/faq.php), is no relation to the infamous Napster
site, but its ``frequently asked questions'' area goes into detail
about how various file-sharing Web sites are built and how the
process of sharing your favorite tunes actually works.
</P>
<P>
   From Napster to relatively new schemes like Riffage and
MojoNation, the Yahoo list is revolutionary. It's not unlike when
Harold Ross, founding editor of The New Yorker magazine, printed a
weekly list of speakeasies in the ``Talk of the Town'' section
during Prohibition. Sure, it's illegal, but it's not going to go
away. As one of the panelists at Jupiter Communications' digital
music conference said, ``20 million pirates can't be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind business-to-business or business-to-consumer or even
business-to-employee. This stuff is free. No money changes hands.
None. Zero. Nada. We've got ourselves a whole new category here,
``P-to-P'' _ no, not profits to profitability, that's P2P for those
of you keeping score at home _ but peer-to-peer. Yahoo knows people
are searching for these sites, as do other search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of July, things weren't looking too good for
Napster, the most popular of these P-to-P sites. A lawsuit from the
RIAA could have shut it down permanently. But the lawsuit backfired
in the worst way possible for the labels. Users flocked to Napster
in record numbers, according to Web measurement service Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Napster saw a 92 percent increase in traffic. Eight hundred
thousand and forty nine music lovers all were swapping music for
free shortly after the ruling. Business _ if you can call it
business; there's no profit-taking after all _ at Napster has never
been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in the downloads of Napster on the heels of the
court stay is a strong indication that digital downloading has hit
critical mass among American Web consumers,'' said Allen Weiner,
vice president of analytical services at NetRatings. ``Rather than
fight this evolution, the entertainment industry should embrace it
and develop sensible solutions to capitalize on this market
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not going to happen anytime soon. The major labels
are so obsessed with stopping Napster and other music download
sites that they can't or won't get together to offer consumers a
better, legal way to download music.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, these same companies don't have any problems
selling their music to stores like Tower, HMV or the Virgin
Megastores.
</P>
<P>
   All of these stores have online sites, and Virgin especially is
ready to go with a site called JamCast, (www.jamcast.com). Users
register to use the site, download a player such as RealAudio,
LiquidAudio or WinAmp, and then shop the site for a variety of
tracks to download from bands as diverse as Smashing Pumpkins to
Duran Duran.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Virgin Jamcast site is very hip, packed with
features and fun to use (it even has a decorative ``skin'' you can
download for your RealAudio player, changing its on-screen
appearance), it doesn't have anywhere near the number of songs
Napster has. Neither JamCast nor any other legitimate digital music
site will be able to take off until they can fill their virtual
shelves with as much music as they pack into their retail stores.
The Virgin Megastores aren't called Megastores for nothing. But
JamCast's shelves are still relatively empty.
</P>
<P>
   This is why so many music fans are still going the illegal route
_ the illegal sites have what fans want. Music, music and more
music. Now Yahoo has a category to help them find music faster and
more efficiently. How much longer will the record industry continue
with its posture of righteous indignation and endless lawsuits
before it realizes that the money spent on lawyers would be better
spent working on a digital music Web site and converting all these
``digital music pirates'' into happy, downloading, paid-in-full
consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Until that glorious day comes, there's always Napster and a long
list of other sites, neatly provided to you in list form from
Yahoo.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.etour.com _ Do you need more than a search engine or a
newspaper's list of cool Web sites to make your Web browsing
experience more suited to your own needs. eTour, whose motto is
``Surf Without Searching,'' asks you to fill out a sizable
questionnaire and then offers sites hand-picked by scrappy human
editors to fit your preferences.
</P>
<P>
   www.send4fun.com _ Want to be the most hated person in your
office? Just use this site to mail overly cutesy, prefabricated and
ultimately useless mail in the vein of the famous ``Hamsterdance.''
There are special pages (''Thank You, Mother''), dance pages
(''Crocodile Rock'') and all-around fun pages (''Mission
Possible.'') We'd say more, if we could retrieve our bile and stop
gagging.
</P>
<P>
   www.dotcomfailures.com _ Hey dot-commers, don't get cocky. This
site is a reminder that for every eBay, there's dozens of companies
like Freewwweb.com waiting to fold. The site is a searchable
database of failing Internet company news, predictions and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   www.askOJ.com _ Oh dear. As if dot-com failures weren't
depressing enough, there is this juicy site, which promises live
chats with O.J. Simpson in which he answers questions directly from
readers. For a $7.95 fee, you can save yourself an advanced seat.
Let's hope it tanks, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   www.snapfish.com _ We've been promised a revolution in the way
we take photos for years, but maybe the revolution is in how
they're printed and viewed rather than the ``Say cheese!'' side.
Snapfish.com will send you a free mailer for your film, send you
free prints and then allow you to view the same photos online and
share them with friends. The quality leaves a little to be desired,
but the price is definitely right. (Reprints and doubles, however,
do cost extra.)

 &HT;    Old photographer ready to go digital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big thing for home computer users now is digital
imaging, which is a fancy way of saying home photographs and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, high on my wish list these days is a decent digital
camera. A still camera would be nice; a video camera would be
doubly nice so long as stills could be made from its output, and
generally, I believe, they can.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer of fairly recent vintage and an inkjet printer
capable of 1200 dpi printing _ which can be had for under $200 _
you have all the darkroom that will ever be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras within the financial reach of most of us are
pretty simple things compared to your average single-lens reflex.
The latter will have interchangeable lenses, allowing you to
completely manipulate the exposure and the focus. There are digital
cameras that provide all that, too, but they are in the very
serious professional range.
</P>
<P>
   Most digital cameras have, at best, a lens with a zoom range of
3X, or three times normal. They are autofocus and offer only a
general kind of exposure control.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest advantages of digital cameras is that most
have a little screen on which you can get a look at the picture you
just made. If it doesn't suit you, it can be dumped from memory;
you don't have to take up the camera's limited memory with unwanted
photos.
</P>
<P>
   I used to make pictures for money as a sideline. I had my own
darkroom and all that. I gave it up when color became the standard.
Printing color, at that time, was more trouble and expense than I
cared to get into. My cameras were state of the art for the time.

 &HT;    Common sense handy when judging technology reports
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next time you feel silly or dumb because you don't
understand technology, just head for the library, pick up some back
issues of newspapers and magazines, and read some of the technology
stories.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost guaranteed to feel better fast. When it comes to
predicting the future of technology, experts don't get it right
either. And the reporters who write about it are as confused as the
experts.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that technology experts and reporters are stupid. It's
just that predicting technology has never worked. Maybe you
remember the famous quote from Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, in
1943: ``I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.''
And my favorite comes from Popular Mechanics in 1949: ``Computers
in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have such foggy crystal balls when it comes to
technology forecasting, you need to be vigilant when checking out
technology news on TV or in the newspaper. A healthy amount of
skepticism isn't such a bad thing when reading any news story, so
it's a good habit to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   One way to double-check what you read is to use a little known
human power. It's not very popular but it does exist and _ without
learning yoga, taking ginko tablets or attending night classes _ it
can be developed. This mysterious power is called common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it to work. Just like in the third grade, we will
start with a practice problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week my morning newspaper told me that conventional car
radios will go away completely, replaced by fancy radios that
include Internet access. You'll also be able to talk to the car
radio to give it instructions.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Well, start with the rough estimate that only a little more than
half the U.S. population has Internet access. And only 64 percent
of the U.S. population has used the Internet at all _ even one time
counts _ over the past 12 months. So you'd have to figure that
these folks who don't use the Internet (and remember there are ways
to get access free nowadays) probably aren't going to pop for some
fancy wireless Internet radio in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Next, remember that _ even today _ not all cars have radios
installed. My car radio has been broken for about three months and
I haven't gotten around to getting it fixed. So it's a real stretch
to think that all these folks without any radio at all, or who are
driving some beat up pickup truck with a hole where the radio used
to be, are going to switch over to Internet radios.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, as is usually the case, falls in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   These radios are coming _ have been coming for a long time _ and
almost certainly will be fairly common some day. But common sense
tells you that _ unlike what the story said _ the old regular radio
is not going to disappear any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not picking on that one story. Like I said, it's almost
certain that these newfangled radios will be common in luxury cars
and later_ as the years go by _ it'll be found in the sort of cars
that I can afford. But it's also very likely that the regular car
radio will be around for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we're using that story as a teaching point.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is unlikely that the experts and the technology writers
are going to become infallible anytime between now and Christmas,
you're going to have to shoulder some of the burden of
understanding technology. And since technology has become so
important in our daily lives, fair or not, it's a task you need to
undertake.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you read a technology story that says a new
gadget is going to change the world by Tuesday, or that a horrible
new computer virus is going to wipe out everything from Santa Claus
to Santa Cruz, N.M., you need to run the facts through that high
tech filter called common sense.
</P>
<P>
   And, I have some important news for you. Common sense, if used
correctly, can truly change the world.

 &HT;    Let's look down under as Australia gets ready to welcome the
Olympics
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   OFFICIAL NAME
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth of Australia
</P>
<P>
   CAPITAL
</P>
<P>
   Canberra, which is located southwest of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE IN THE WORLD IS IT?
</P>
<P>
   Australia lies in the Southern Hemisphere between the Indian and
South Pacific oceans. It is just below Indonesia and Papua New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is not only a country, it's a whole continent. As a
continent, it's the world's smallest. But as a country, it is the
sixth largest.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERCONTINENT
</P>
<P>
   Australia used to be part of a large land mass, called the
Pangaea. The Pangaea was a supercontinent until it split into two
continents about 200 million years ago _ Laurasia and Gondwanaland.
About 60 million years ago, Gondwanaland began to break up into
what we know now as South America, Africa, Antarctica, India and
Australia. Australia has been on its own as an island continent for
about 35 million years.
</P>
<P>
   WHO LIVES THERE?
</P>
<P>
   More than 18.7 million people inhabit the country. Most of those
people come from European backgrounds. Captain James Cook (not
Hook!) claimed Australia for Great Britain in 1770. Many of the
first colonists were prisoners who were sentenced to live there far
from England. For a long time, mainly British and Irish people
moved to Australia. After World War II, people from Asia, Latin
America, the Middle East and other European nations began moving
there.
</P>
<P>
   THE FIRST AUSTRALIANS
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines are descendents of the Australians who lived there
thousands of years before any Europeans arrived on the continent.
Today, Aborigines make up less than 2 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   HOW BIG IS IT?
</P>
<P>
   Australia is about 3 million square miles _ much of which is
flat, dry land. Aussies call the interior land, away from the
coastal areas, the Outback. If you look at a map, you'll see that
area is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people live in the desert or semi-desert area of the
Outback. Those who do live in ``never, never land'' often work on
huge cattle and sheep ranches, which Australians call ``stations.''
Stations are so big that workers who herd the cattle and sheep use
helicopters and small planes to round up their stock or check
fences.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who grow up in the Outback often don't have neighbors, let
alone schools, within a day's drive. Some learn from the School of
the Air, which allows students and teachers to interact via two-way
radio. You can get medical help from the Royal Flying Doctor
Service, which has airplane ambulances and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Most Australians live in the coastal cities of the east,
southeast and southwest, like Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and
Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>
   Australia gained its independence from Great Britain in 1901,
but it still recognizes England's Queen Elizabeth as its chief of
state. Like England, Australia has a prime minister and a
parliament. Their parliament has a Senate and a House of
Representatives similar to the United States' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Australia is divided into six states and two territories:
New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria,
Western Australia, Australian Capital Territory and the Northern
Territory.
</P>
<P>
   AYERS ROCK
</P>
<P>
   Ayers Rock is a monolith of mystery. Located deep in the
Outback, this huge rock is about 600 million years old. It was once
a part of a huge mountain range. As the sun moves throughout the
day, the rock changes color from mauve to blue to pink to brown to
red. It also entral Moscow's Pushkin Square. It also rattled the
nerves of many who remember the series of explosions that killed
more than 300 people in Russia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's bombers reportedly left a bag of explosives in the
middle of a walkway, then ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are cautious of abandoned bags and boxes.
Officials are trying to track those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the bomb was planted by rebels from the Chechen
region, where there has been a long, bloody fight for independence
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen president has denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   WILDFIRES: Blazes scourge the West
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews from New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and Canada are
arriving in Western states to help 20,000 U.S. firefighters and
National Guard troops battle fires.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 large blazes are burning in the West, with 4.3 million
acres already charred.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's governor closed 6 million acres of land in the state
to keep people from getting trapped by the blazes and to prevent
more fires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are calling this year's fire season the worst in 50
years. Very hot, dry weather and lightning from thunderstorms are
fueling the blazes. Thousands of people have been forced out of
their homes. No one expects to make significant progress in
fighting the flames until the weather changes.
</P>
<P>
   DANGER: Kids' meal toy recalled
</P>
<P>
   If you got a Tangled Treeples toy in a KFC kids meal recently,
you may want to take it back. Small blue animals are packaged in a
green plastic container.
</P>
<P>
   That container could suffocate kids younger than 3. The bottom
of it can fit over a small child's nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   KFC voluntarily recalled the toys after a 19-month-old girl
reportedly got the container stuck over her face. She was not
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The toys were in kids' meals in June and July.

 &HT;    `Pac-Man,' other classics basking in 3-D updates
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Classic video games like ``Pong,'' ``Frogger'' and
``Pac-Man'' still evoke a bit of nostalgia in me. These are the
games I grew up with. These are the games that spawned my love of
video games today.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced a lot, however, and many video games
today make those vintage games look like cave paintings by
comparison. Game characters that were once simple, two-dimensional
representations have evolved into highly detailed, 3-D models.
</P>
<P>
   Game developers still lovingly embrace the spirit of those
arcade classics, however, and have united early titles with current
gaming technology to produce a beautiful marriage of nostalgia and
modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Interactive is one of the enthusiastic developers
producing some of the new classics. A simple game like ``Pong'' has
been fleshed out considerably. What once was an amusement
consisting of two flat sticks and a blip for a ball is now a
multilevel 3-D game with more than 20 scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Following the same scheme, Hasbro Interactive will add
``Breakout'' and ``Galaga'' to its new-classics roster next month.
Other notable Hasbro titles are favorites such as ``Frogger,''
``Missile Command,'' ``Centipede'' and ``Q-Bert.''
</P>
<P>
   One arcade veteran, Midway, has given the classic game
``Rampage'' a new face. The original arcade game put up to three
players in command of a trio of city-crushing creatures. The object
was simply to smash away and demolish buildings while avoiding army
units and pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Midway's new ``Rampage Through Time'' expands on the premise and
presentation. Now sporting twice as many monsters to choose from,
various minigames and city locations from throughout history,
Midway has given a classic new life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best resurrections is ``Pac-Man World'' by Namco. If
there is one game that represents the classics, it would have to be
``Pac-Man.'' The little chomping hero recently celebrated his 20th
anniversary, and Namco has honored him appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The basic elements are still there: mazes, power pellets and, of
course, the ghost pests Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde. This time
around, however, Pac-Man's world is in 3-D, and he faces new
challenges and enemies in imaginative locations.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful, stylized graphics, new game play and multiple game
modes enhance the classic title tenfold. There is even an original
version included in case you want to relive the good ol' days.

 &HT;    Flash Player brightens Web sites
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   What is Macromedia Flash 4? Will it affect other programs? Is it
a program that you can install but never remove? I am requested to
download it before using some educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.H. Downing
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like you're talking about the free viewer called
Macromedia Flash Player. Through your browser, it lets you
experience animation and entertainment that designers weave into
Web sites. Fun buttons. Movies. Flying logos. Graphics. You name
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We're talking Web sites with sizzling content, such as
cartoons, interactive interfaces, online tutorials and information
graphics that were created using the ``Big Daddy'' program,
Macromedia Flash. Unlike the player, it isn't a freebie (Cost: $250
to $280). The software is part of Macromedia's graphics, Web
authoring and integration tools. A new release, Flash 5, is due out
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Like its name, it has ``flash.'' The operative word is
``animation.'' Web designers use the animation tool to dazzle,
adding sounds, interactivity, the whole shebang, to create a
high-impact, low-bandwidth Web experience.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Low bandwidth is a good thing. Flash-based files are
smaller in size and can be viewed fast and efficiently. A mega-huge
data pipeline isn't required, and you don't wait all day for
animation or graphics to do their thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Let's get back to Flash Player. It's a browser plug-in
available for Mac and PC, and we haven't seen any ill effects on
other programs. The player is tiny and takes a short time to
download, which you can do when a Web site tells you that you need
it or go to cnet.com/downloads/ or macromedia.com/software/.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Flash Player works hand-in-hand with another free
plug-in, Shockwave Player, the king of multimedia playback. Add
that to your download list, too. What's cool, if you download
Shockwave first, Flash Player will tag along. Other fun Internet
players also can be found at CNET. Get RealPlayer Basic to enjoy
streaming audio and video. Mac users can find the Quicktime
plug-in, too. It's Apple's video technology that allows you to play
high-quality video directly on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The plug-ins don't have to become permanent residents on
your computer. You can evict them. Once you see how they enrich
your Web visits, I bet you let 'em stay.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Explore how companies such as K-Swiss, North Face,
Sprint, Nike, Disney, Macy's, etc., used the ``Big Daddy'' Flash to
add pizzazz to their Web sites. The Air Force is a Flash fan, too.
Surf to macromedia.com/showcase/ and click the Flash link.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Without Flash Player, you'd miss seeing the shimmer of
those sites.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    A pacifier with peace of mind
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Since my son prefers his thumb and did not take to those tried
and true ``face-plugs,'' as my wife and I like to call baby
pacifiers, I never got a chance to truly evaluate Mabis'
TenderTykes Digital Pacifier Thermometer ($10; www.mabis .net).
Instead, I stuck it in my own mouth, much to my son's delight, and
found that yup, it works, and yup, I feel silly. A nifty device as
relevant now as it was in the caveman days, the unit contains a
digital thermometer within an orthodontic nipple with a little,
easy-to-read liquid crystal display that does not require you to
remove the pacifier in order to see it. The device also has an
oxymoronic ``Lullaby Alarm'' should it detect a fever. It has
memory and will recall the last reading, too, so you can gauge
where exactly this fever may or may not be going. To be truly
effective, of course, the fevered wee one has to like face plugs in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   THE TOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN
</P>
<P>
   Console games that appeal to both kids and adults and
notoriously difficult to produce. That's why it's such a breath of
fresh air to play Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue ($40;
www.sega.com; for the Sega Dreamcast), which appeals not just to
the gaming tyke but to the more mature gamer as well. The game,
featuring the original voice actors from ``Toy Story 2,'' uses
environments from the movie to create an immersive 3-D environment
that is only enhanced by the Dreamcast's graphic abilities.
Everything is sharp and gorgeous, as in the Pixar film. Controlling
Buzz as he navigates a playroom or the kitchen is a treat. If
there's one drawback it's that the wide range of controls and huge
environments can be a little intimidating _ you get to feel like a
tiny toy lost in an oversized world.

 &HT;    Common sense handy when judging technology reports
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next time you feel silly or dumb because you don't
understand technology, just head for the library, pick up some back
issues of newspapers and magazines, and read some of the technology
stories.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost guaranteed to feel better fast. When it comes to
predicting the future of technology, experts don't get it right
either. And the reporters who write about it are as confused as the
experts.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that technology experts and reporters are stupid. It's
just that predicting technology has never worked. Maybe you
remember the famous quote from Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, in
1943: ``I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.''
And my favorite comes from Popular Mechanics in 1949: ``Computers
in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have such foggy crystal balls when it comes to
technology forecasting, you need to be vigilant when checking out
technology news on TV or in the newspaper. A healthy amount of
skepticism isn't such a bad thing when reading any news story, so
it's a good habit to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   One way to double-check what you read is to use a little known
human power. It's not very popular but it does exist and _ without
learning yoga, taking ginko tablets or attending night classes _ it
can be developed. This mysterious power is called common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it to work. Just like in the third grade, we will
start with a practice problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week my morning newspaper told me that conventional car
radios will go away completely, replaced by fancy radios that
include Internet access. You'll also be able to talk to the car
radio to give it instructions.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Well, start with the rough estimate that only a little more than
half the U.S. population has Internet access. And only 64 percent
of the U.S. population has used the Internet at all _ even one time
counts _ over the past 12 months. So you'd have to figure that
these folks who don't use the Internet (and remember there are ways
to get access free nowadays) probably aren't going to pop for some
fancy wireless Internet radio in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Next, remember that _ even today _ not all cars have radios
installed. My car radio has been broken for about three months and
I haven't gotten around to getting it fixed. So it's a real stretch
to think that all these folks without any radio at all, or who are
driving some beat up pickup truck with a hole where the radio used
to be, are going to switch over to Internet radios.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, as is usually the case, falls in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   These radios are coming _ have been coming for a long time _ and
almost certainly will be fairly common some day. But common sense
tells you that _ unlike what the story said _ the old regular radio
is not going to disappear any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not picking on that one story. Like I said, it's almost
certain that these newfangled radios will be common in luxury cars
and later_ as the years go by _ it'll be found in the sort of cars
that I can afford. But it's also very likely that the regular car
radio will be around for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we're using that story as a teaching point.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is unlikely that the experts and the technology writers
are going to become infallible anytime between now and Christmas,
you're going to have to shoulder some of the burden of
understanding technology. And since technology has become so
important in our daily lives, fair or not, it's a task you need to
undertake.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you read a technology story that says a new
gadget is going to change the world by Tuesday, or that a horrible
new computer virus is going to wipe out everything from Santa Claus
to Santa Cruz, N.M., you need to run the facts through that high
tech filter called common sense.
</P>
<P>
   And, I have some important news for you. Common sense, if used
correctly, can truly change the world.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Street Fighter EX2 Plus ($35; www.capcom.com; for the
PlayStation) is maddening! Following in the steps of Capcom's
flagship Street Fighter series, Street Fighter EX2 Plus pulls you
into the fiercest brawls against some of the baddest characters on
the videogame block. Menacing fighters with moves like the Psycho
Crusher, the Atomic Suplex and the Death Press wreak mental anguish
and virtual pain on your character, forcing you to open up your own
little can of whip-butt. But no matter how many blows you land,
nine times out of 10 you're gonna lose when you play against the
PlayStation fighters. With its vivid 3-D graphics, rapid, smooth
animation and those nauseating grunts, groans and yelps so germane
to these types of fighting games, Street Fighter EX2 Plus will keep
you and your thumbs busy _ at least until you're too frustrated to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants to be a Millionaire 2nd Edition ($40; www.playstation
.com; for the PlayStation) tries to emulate the essence of
Philbin's game show phenomenon by adding a dramatic pregnant pause
every time you select your multiple choice answer. This is
aggravating in a PlayStation game where we suffer enough loading
delays as it is. Ironically, that's the best this game has to
offer. It's trivia with Regis Philbin doing some voice work _ and
most of that is just sampled from the actual show. Other than that,
there's almost nothing here remotely resembling a video game: The
graphic interface is sparse and cheap (you stare, alternately, at
two empty chairs, or text, or an empty set mock up). And the
capper: Questions must be answered within an allotted time frame;
unlike the show, contestants are not allowed to reminisce about the
7th grade school teacher who taught extensively on the subject; no
hemming and hawing, no repartee with the host. The nerve! Give me a
time limit and then preprogram a pregnant pause before telling me
if my rushed answer is right or wrong? Lame. Who thinks it's
possible to be a millionaire by starting out $40 in the hole and
that much further away from being a millionaire with nothing to
show for it except for ``branded consumer who doesn't deserve to be
a millionaire'' emblazoned on their forehead?
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say that the problem with Doom designer John
Romero's highly anticipated Daikatana ($40; www.daikatana.com; for
Windows) is that because it came along far later than promised,
truly great shooters like Unreal: Tournament and Half-Life arrived
in the meantime to leave it in the dust. And that's true. But the
real cruncher is that, though it bulges with visual flourishes and
mildly interesting weapons and monsters, the gameplay itself lies
along a spectrum from annoying to tiresome. It simply isn't much
fun. With ``save gems'' that must be tediously collected prior to
ending a session, maddeningly frustrating (but much-touted and
politically incorrect) sidekicks, laughable cinematics and
half-hearted (but seemingly endless) level designs, this story of
time-travel and swordplay offers little sparkle and no spark,
arriving stillborn after the long, long wait. Vampire: The
Masquerade _ Redemption ($45, www.activision.com; for Windows)
drops you into an immersive 3-D world where role-playing, action
and puzzle-solving are well balanced. That's the good news.
Creeping about in the shadows as the undead anti-hero Christof and
hacking away at one's enemies or drinking the blood of one's
victims iss are lovely and the characters who join your party are
interesting and even helpful. But the most highly anticipated
aspect of the game, storyteller mode, in which one player builds
and controls a world as the game is running, disappoints in that it
requires a sure hand at the helm _ something difficult to find in
the twitchfest of the Internet _ and generally degenerates into a
free-for-all. But given the right circumstances _ a well-built LAN
game with all the players physically in a room together _ Vampire
has the potential for transcending even its worst glitches.

 &HT;    Cool running
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When you're hot, you're hot _ but you should
have some say in the matter. Consider then the Convair 900
``Prestige'' Evaporative Air Cooler ($300; www.convair.net.au). Not
to be confused with conventional air conditioners, evaporative
coolers employ a contrary, environmentally friendly means to
comfort-zone ends. Air is drawn through a large, wet filter pad by
a powerful (and distinctly audible) fan, a process similarly seen
in nature when air is cooled when it passes over an ocean or large
body of water. The Prestige holds up to four gallons of water and
has a tank gauge to monitor consumption. As a self-contained,
free-standing unit requiring only an AC power source, the Convair
900 Prestige does not require permanent installation of gaudy bulk.
It can be wheeled to any room as needed, including the storage shed
during the off-seasons. Essentially a humidifier, the Convair
Prestige is innately less effective in extremely humid climates,
but when it's simpatico with the environment, the Prestige is very
cool.

<P>
   A MOVIE AND THEN SOME
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence Day'' was certainly a resplendently overblown,
over-acted blockbuster extravaganza when it hit the theaters back
in 1996. Now you can see it all over again _ along with nine
additional minutes of fantastical footage _ in all its widescreen,
invading-alien glory. With optional running commentaries from
members of the production crew accompanying the first disc,
Independence Day Five Star Collection ($35; www.foxhome.com) also
includes a second DVD stuffed with features such as a ``making of''
ID4 documentary, a cheeky alien invasion ``mockumentry'' and an HBO
First Look featurette hosted by Jeff Goldblum, as well as deleted
scenes, outtakes, storyboards, concept art, production stills and
even a DVD-ROM game called ``Get Off My Planet'' playable directly
from one's DVD player.BARBECUER'S DECK HAND
</P>
<P>
   Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks? At one time or
another most grills become the source of a deck-top mess. Instead
of pressure washing wood or stone after every cookout, why not buy
a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill Pad ($25 to $40
depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little more than a pad
of thick, felt-like material coated in colored concrete. But it's
big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch rounds) to protect
the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from the garden hose.

<P>
   www.etour.com _ Do you need more than a search engine or a
newspaper's list of cool Web sites to make your Web browsing

``Surf Without Searching,'' asks you to fill out a sizable
questionnaire and then offers sites hand-picked by scrappy human
editors to fit your preferences.
</P>
<P>
   www.send4fun.com _ Want to be the most hated person in your

gagging.

<P>
   www.dotcomfailures.com _ Hey dot-commers, don't get cocky. This

database of failing Internet company news, predictions and rumors.
</P>
<P>
   www.askOJ.com _ Oh dear. As if dot-com failures weren't
depressing enough, there is this juicy site, which promises live
chats with O.J. Simpson in which he answers questions directly from

Let's hope it tanks, and soon.

<P>
   www.snapfish.com _ We've been promised a revolution in the way
we take photos for years, but maybe the revolution is in how
they're printed and viewed rather than the ``Say cheese!'' side.
Snapfish.com will send you a free mailer for your film, send you
free prints and then allow you to view the same photos online and
share them with friends. The quality leaves a little to be desired,
but the price is definitely right. (Reprints and doubles, however,
do cost extra.)

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Listening or your own space, you might want to check out the
Monsoon iM-700 multimedia speakers ($170; www.monsoonpower.com).
The set, which comes with two flat desktop speakers, a powered
amplifier/subwoofer and a tiny ``puck'' for volume and mute
control, is perfect for a workstation _ the speakers are sleek and
take up little room on a desk. They also sound great, offering good
sound on a Mac or in Windows, whether its for music or games. In
Windows, however, there is a noticeable hiss when nothing is
playing. The speakers also require finicky positioning to sound
good and are sometimes a little too sibilant, especially when
playing CDs. But if style's your thing, you probably won't find a
better-looking set of speakers to impress your co-workers.

 &HT;    Resources on Web can ease usual back-to-school frenzy
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I can tell summer is drawing to an end. Almost daily,
more and more people ask me, ``Are you ready for school to start?''
</P>
<P>
   I've starting making the before-school-opens runs: to the
pediatrician to pick up the immunization form; by the school to
drop off forms and pick up fund-raising packets; to the
orthodontist for an end-of-summer check. My family has checked out
the new band color scheme. (We switched from a startling orange and
green to a more sedate black and gray. ``Makes me look older, don't
you think?'' he asked. ``Yes,'' I agreed, ``not to mention less
pulsating.'')
</P>
<P>
   All summer I've been randomly gathering thoughts, tips, Web
sites and information on reading, studying and homework with the
idea of developing a plan that would help get us through the school
year. Of course, with school a week away, it's not ready, but I'm
working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I've been scouting the Internet searching for sites
that help with homework and research. I found www
</P>
<P>
   .bookadventure.org, an online reading program sponsored by
Sylvan Learning Center, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Lycos to be a helpful
source for a number of educational resources.
</P>
<P>
   The site promotes its own online reading program, created by
Sylvan Learning Foundation, on which parents and children register.
The kids are quizzed on books selected from the site's list and are
rewarded with prizes selected by their parents. I didn't use the
reading program, but I found the educational resources listed
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Book Adventure led me to www.familyeducation.com. There I found
several features and programs that can be downloaded, including a
definition-testing program that can be customized with your child's
vocabulary words. On many a night last year, such a program would
have come in handy at my house.
</P>
<P>
   This site offers suggestions on a wide range of topics based on
age and grade levels ranging from babies and toddlers to high
school. Advice from teachers regarding specific issues that parents
have raised are also available. Reading such Q&AMP;As often helps me
identify issues and helps frame questions I want to ask my own
sons' teachers.
</P>
<P>
   I also encountered some pertinent advice concerning my master
plan. One was a feature titled ``Go Back to School in Six Easy
Steps.'' Step 3, ``Don't Clean the Slate,'' advises:
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem like a great time to clean up, sort out and set
new ground rules for family life. Chores are reassigned, allowances
renegotiated, and after-school sports and activities scheduled.
While change is good, the timing requires some reflection. Too much
too soon can make even the most cooperative child balk. Focus on
the start of school, and revisit the other issues after your kids
feel more settled.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like hearing Pavlov's bell. Clearly with the summer's
reprieve, I tried to bury memories of the rigors of getting back
into a routine. But luckily my subconscious was on the case, and we
are safe for now from a ``Mom's going crazy and changing
everything'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the boys will be relieved.

 &HT;    Yahoo strikes a blow for free music
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Music lovers _ not to mention the lawyers and rock
groups who want to sue them _ will be intrigued by Yahoo's new
category listing: ``Digital Distribution.'' They'll especially love
the subcategory: ``Peer to Peer File Sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``peer to peer file sharing'' has a nice ring to it,
but essentially it's a high-class way of saying: ``Hey, everybody!
Here's a list of places where you can swap music online for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has a long and fairly comprehensive list of illegal places
to download music. It's a wonder the Recording Industry Association
of America hasn't filed suit against it for aiding and abetting
music-loving lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the infamous places to download music is Napster
(www.napster.com), an entirely free service with literally
thousands of songs available, and every single download is free.
</P>
<P>
   As the RIAA has been saying for some time, and as we all know by
now, downloading the kind of music you'll find on Internet sites
such as Napster and several others is illegal. It violates
copyright laws and all of the fair-use statutes _ and that's just
for starters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Peer to Peer File Sharing'' category lists 25 Web sites
where users can exchange music for free. One site, MyNapster
(www.mynapster.com/faq.php), is no relation to the infamous Napster
site, but its ``frequently asked questions'' area goes into detail
about how various file-sharing Web sites are built and how the
process of sharing your favorite tunes actually works.
</P>
<P>
   From Napster to relatively new schemes like Riffage and
MojoNation, the Yahoo list is revolutionary. It's not unlike when
Harold Ross, founding editor of The New Yorker magazine, printed a
weekly list of speakeasies in the ``Talk of the Town'' section
during Prohibition. Sure, it's illegal, but it's not going to go
away. As one of the panelists at Jupiter Communications' digital
music conference said, ``20 million pirates can't be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind business-to-business or business-to-consumer or even
business-to-employee. This stuff is free. No money changes hands.
None. Zero. Nada. We've got ourselves a whole new category here,
``P-to-P'' _ no, not profits to profitability, that's P2P for those
of you keeping score at home _ but peer-to-peer. Yahoo knows people
are searching for these sites, as do other search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of July, things weren't looking too good for
Napster, the most popular of these P-to-P sites. A lawsuit from the
RIAA could have shut it down permanently. But the lawsuit backfired
in the worst way possible for the labels. Users flocked to Napster
in record numbers, according to Web measurement service Nielsen
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Napster saw a 92 percent increase in traffic. Eight hundred
thousand and forty nine music lovers all were swapping music for
free shortly after the ruling. Business _ if you can call it
business; there's no profit-taking after all _ at Napster has never
been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in the downloads of Napster on the heels of the
court stay is a strong indication that digital downloading has hit
critical mass among American Web consumers,'' said Allen Weiner,
vice president of analytical services at NetRatings. ``Rather than
fight this evolution, the entertainment industry should embrace it
and develop sensible solutions to capitalize on this market
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not going to happen anytime soon. The major labels
are so obsessed with stopping Napster and other music download
sites that they can't or won't get together to offer consumers a
better, legal way to download music.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, these same companies don't have any problems
selling their music to stores like Tower, HMV or the Virgin
Megastores.
</P>
<P>
   All of these stores have online sites, and Virgin especially is
ready to go with a site called JamCast, (www.jamcast.com). Users
register to use the site, download a player such as RealAudio,
LiquidAudio or WinAmp, and then shop the site for a variety of
tracks to download from bands as diverse as Smashing Pumpkins to
Duran Duran.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Virgin Jamcast site is very hip, packed with
features and fun to use (it even has a decorative ``skin'' you can
download for your RealAudio player, changing its on-screen
appearance), it doesn't have anywhere near the number of songs
Napster has. Neither JamCast nor any other legitimate digital music
site will be able to take off until they can fill their virtual
shelves with as much music as they pack into their retail stores.
The Virgin Megastores aren't called Megastores for nothing. But
JamCast's shelves are still relatively empty.
</P>
<P>
   This is why so many music fans are still going the illegal route
_ the illegal sites have what fans want. Music, music and more
music. Now Yahoo has a category to help them find music faster and
more efficiently. How much longer will the record industry continue
with its posture of righteous indignation and endless lawsuits
before it realizes that the money spent on lawyers would be better
spent working on a digital music Web site and converting all these
``digital music pirates'' into happy, downloading, paid-in-full
consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Until that glorious day comes, there's always Napster and a long
list of other sites, neatly provided to you in list form from
Yahoo.

 &HT;    `Pac-Man,' other classics basking in 3-D updates
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Classic video games like ``Pong,'' ``Frogger'' and
``Pac-Man'' still evoke a bit of nostalgia in me. These are the
games I grew up with. These are the games that spawned my love of
video games today.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced a lot, however, and many video games
today make those vintage games look like cave paintings by
comparison. Game characters that were once simple, two-dimensional
representations have evolved into highly detailed, 3-D models.
</P>
<P>
   Game developers still lovingly embrace the spirit of those
arcade classics, however, and have united early titles with current
gaming technology to produce a beautiful marriage of nostalgia and
modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro Interactive is one of the enthusiastic developers
producing some of the new classics. A simple game like ``Pong'' has
been fleshed out considerably. What once was an amusement
consisting of two flat sticks and a blip for a ball is now a
multilevel 3-D game with more than 20 scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Following the same scheme, Hasbro Interactive will add
``Breakout'' and ``Galaga'' to its new-classics roster next month.
Other notable Hasbro titles are favorites such as ``Frogger,''
``Missile Command,'' ``Centipede'' and ``Q-Bert.''
</P>
<P>
   One arcade veteran, Midway, has given the classic game
``Rampage'' a new face. The original arcade game put up to three
players in command of a trio of city-crushing creatures. The object
was simply to smash away and demolish buildings while avoiding army
units and pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Midway's new ``Rampage Through Time'' expands on the premise and
presentation. Now sporting twice as many monsters to choose from,
various minigames and city locations from throughout history,
Midway has given a classic new life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best resurrections is ``Pac-Man World'' by Namco. If
there is one game that represents the classics, it would have to be
``Pac-Man.'' The little chomping hero recently celebrated his 20th
anniversary, and Namco has honored him appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The basic elements are still there: mazes, power pellets and, of
course, the ghost pests Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde. This time
around, however, Pac-Man's world is in 3-D, and he faces new
challenges and enemies in imaginative locations.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful, stylized graphics, new game play and multiple game
modes enhance the classic title tenfold. There is even an original
version included in case you want to relive the good ol' days.

 &HT;    Flash Player brightens Web sites
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   What is Macromedia Flash 4? Will it affect other programs? Is it
a program that you can install but never remove? I am requested to
download it before using some educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.H. Downing
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like you're talking about the free viewer called
Macromedia Flash Player. Through your browser, it lets you
experience animation and entertainment that designers weave into
Web sites. Fun buttons. Movies. Flying logos. Graphics. You name
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We're talking Web sites with sizzling content, such as
cartoons, interactive interfaces, online tutorials and information
graphics that were created using the ``Big Daddy'' program,
Macromedia Flash. Unlike the player, it isn't a freebie (Cost: $250
to $280). The software is part of Macromedia's graphics, Web
authoring and integration tools. A new release, Flash 5, is due out
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Like its name, it has ``flash.'' The operative word is
``animation.'' Web designers use the animation tool to dazzle,
adding sounds, interactivity, the whole shebang, to create a
high-impact, low-bandwidth Web experience.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Low bandwidth is a good thing. Flash-based files are
smaller in size and can be viewed fast and efficiently. A mega-huge
data pipeline isn't required, and you don't wait all day for
animation or graphics to do their thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Let's get back to Flash Player. It's a browser plug-in
available for Mac and PC, and we haven't seen any ill effects on
other programs. The player is tiny and takes a short time to
download, which you can do when a Web site tells you that you need
it or go to cnet.com/downloads/ or macromedia.com/software/.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Flash Player works hand-in-hand with another free
plug-in, Shockwave Player, the king of multimedia playback. Add
that to your download list, too. What's cool, if you download
Shockwave first, Flash Player will tag along. Other fun Internet
players also can be found at CNET. Get RealPlayer Basic to enjoy
streaming audio and video. Mac users can find the Quicktime
plug-in, too. It's Apple's video technology that allows you to play
high-quality video directly on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The plug-ins don't have to become permanent residents on
your computer. You can evict them. Once you see how they enrich
your Web visits, I bet you let 'em stay.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Explore how companies such as K-Swiss, North Face,
Sprint, Nike, Disney, Macy's, etc., used the ``Big Daddy'' Flash to
add pizzazz to their Web sites. The Air Force is a Flash fan, too.
Surf to macromedia.com/showcase/ and click the Flash link.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Without Flash Player, you'd miss seeing the shimmer of
those sites.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Old photographer ready to go digital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big thing for home computer users now is digital
imaging, which is a fancy way of saying home photographs and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, high on my wish list these days is a decent digital
camera. A still camera would be nice; a video camera would be
doubly nice so long as stills could be made from its output, and
generally, I believe, they can.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer of fairly recent vintage and an inkjet printer
capable of 1200 dpi printing _ which can be had for under $200 _
you have all the darkroom that will ever be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras within the financial reach of most of us are
pretty simple things compared to your average single-lens reflex.
The latter will have interchangeable lenses, allowing you to
completely manipulate the exposure and the focus. There are digital
cameras that provide all that, too, but they are in the very
serious professional range.
</P>
<P>
   Most digital cameras have, at best, a lens with a zoom range of
3X, or three times normal. They are autofocus and offer only a
general kind of exposure control.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest advantages of digital cameras is that most
have a little screen on which you can get a look at the picture you
just made. If it doesn't suit you, it can be dumped from memory;
you don't have to take up the camera's limited memory with unwanted
photos.
</P>
<P>
   I used to make pictures for money as a sideline. I had my own
darkroom and all that. I gave it up when color became the standard.
Printing color, at that time, was more trouble and expense than I
cared to get into. My cameras were state of the art for the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now I would be delighted with a simple digital camera that
offered close to 2 megapixels of resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Two megapixels, according to the experts, separates the men from
the boys in terms of image quality. With 2 megapixels, you can make
nice 8x10 prints. Under that you had best stick with 5x7 images. I
could go with 5x7. The lower resolution is quite sufficient for
putting pictures on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, make lovely prints with an inkjet printer and
the right paper. I've just finished testing some paper from a firm
called AGA Chemicals, which markets the stuff under the Pictorico
label.
</P>
<P>
   Using a stock picture in Adobe Photosuite LE, I ran three kinds
of paper through my LexMark 5700: Photo Gallery Hi-Gloss White
film, Premium Photo Glossy Paper and Premium Canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The results were spectacular. It's hard for me to see a lot of
difference between the Photo Gallery stock, which is terribly dear
at $75 for 40 sheets, and the Premium Photo, at a very reasonable
$12 for 20 sheets. Both presented a brilliant image.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas paper is a very heavy stock, with a strong canvaslike
texture, and it lent an entirely different feel to the photo. You
wouldn't use it often at 10 sheets for $22, but it would be grand
for certain painterly images.
</P>
<P>
   All those prices, incidentally, are for 8x10 sheets. You can get
more information, and order paper if you can't find it locally,
from www.pictorico.com.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The widely held notion that Al Gore hired on the
overtly religious Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate in
order to wash himself of scandal raises an awkward question. Dare
we ask, ``What scandal?'' Two matters are charged against the vice
president's account, neither amounting to a hill of beans. (Teepen,

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I have a question that has been bugging me
for a while. There are insects that live in the trees in the Hill
Country that make short, very loud noises after sunset, typically
in the spring and early summer (brzzzt, brzzzt, brzzzt). There are
also insects that make a loud, continuous droning noise in the
trees during the heat of the day, like zzzzzzzzz. I have heard the
latter called ``heat bugs,'' maybe a type of cicada. What are the
former bugs? Are they the same cicada, giving off their night
sound? Or katydids?
</P>
<P>
   _ James Machin
</P>
<P>
   A: Cicadas make the loud buzzing noise from trees during the
day; katydids and tree crickets chirp after dark. There is almost
no overlap in the time that they ``sing,'' reports Texas A&AMP;M
entomologist John Jackman. A male cicada rests in trees, singing to
attract females using vibrating membranes in the side of the
abdomen. Male katydids generate sound by rubbing their wings
together. Want to know more? Check the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service Field Guide at
http://insects.tamu.edu/images/insects/fieldguide/index.html. Q:
I'm looking for a gift for a friend who often gets far too wired on
coffee and caffeine. The character Too Much Coffee Man (TMCM)
really fits. Where can I get a T-shirt with this character?
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Shirts sporting the popular cartoonist Shannon Wheeler's
character can be ordered at the keyboard by visiting www.tmcm.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was wondering about Jell-O. Doesn't it contain ground-up
hooves and horns?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lee Brown
</P>
<P>
   A: No, Jell-O is made from collagen found in animals used for
food. Hooves and horns do not contain collagen, according to Kraft
Foods spokeswoman Mary Jane Kinkade. But the hide trimmings do. So
collagen from the trimmings is processed, purified and filtered
before being ground into powdered gelatin. Popular food, Jell-O.
Did you realize more than 1.1 million packages are purchased or
eaten every day? Guess the nadir of the congealed fruit salad has
yet to come. Q: My friend is trying to load a wild cow (600
pounds). Is there any food additive to calm down the animal?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mayte S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing that is approved by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture or the Food and Drug Administration to be given orally
to food-producing animals, reports veterinarian Gary Warner, who
has extensive experience with large animals. Loading a cow, says
Warner, is usually not a problem. In order to sedate all 600
pounds, you will need something such as Ace Promazine administered
intramuscularly to the animal. Happy trails.

 &HT;    Resources on Web can ease usual back-to-school frenzy
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I can tell summer is drawing to an end. Almost daily,
more and more people ask me, ``Are you ready for school to start?''
</P>
<P>
   I've starting making the before-school-opens runs: to the
pediatrician to pick up the immunization form; by the school to
drop off forms and pick up fund-raising packets; to the
orthodontist for an end-of-summer check. My family has checked out
the new band color scheme. (We switched from a startling orange and
green to a more sedate black and gray. ``Makes me look older, don't
you think?'' he asked. ``Yes,'' I agreed, ``not to mention less
pulsating.'')
</P>
<P>
   All summer I've been randomly gathering thoughts, tips, Web
sites and information on reading, studying and homework with the
idea of developing a plan that would help get us through the school
year. Of course, with school a week away, it's not ready, but I'm
working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I've been scouting the Internet searching for sites
that help with homework and research. I found www
</P>
<P>
   .bookadventure.org, an online reading program sponsored by
Sylvan Learning Center, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Lycos to be a helpful
source for a number of educational resources.
</P>
<P>
   The site promotes its own online reading program, created by
Sylvan Learning Foundation, on which parents and children register.
The kids are quizzed on books selected from the site's list and are
rewarded with prizes selected by their parents. I didn't use the
reading program, but I found the educational resources listed
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Book Adventure led me to www.familyeducation.com. There I found
several features and programs that can be downloaded, including a
definition-testing program that can be customized with your child's
vocabulary words. On many a night last year, such a program would
have come in handy at my house.
</P>
<P>
   This site offers suggestions on a wide range of topics based on
age and grade levels ranging from babies and toddlers to high
school. Advice from teachers regarding specific issues that parents
have raised are also available. Reading such Q&AMP;As often helps me
identify issues and helps frame questions I want to ask my own
sons' teachers.
</P>
<P>
   I also encountered some pertinent advice concerning my master
plan. One was a feature titled ``Go Back to School in Six Easy
Steps.'' Step 3, ``Don't Clean the Slate,'' advises:
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem like a great time to clean up, sort out and set
new ground rules for family life. Chores are reassigned, allowances
renegotiated, and after-school sports and activities scheduled.
While change is good, the timing requires some reflection. Too much
too soon can make even the most cooperative child balk. Focus on
the start of school, and revisit the other issues after your kids
feel more settled.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like hearing Pavlov's bell. Clearly with the summer's
reprieve, I tried to bury memories of the rigors of getting back
into a routine. But luckily my subconscious was on the case, and we
are safe for now from a ``Mom's going crazy and changing
everything'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the boys will be relieved.

 &HT;    Wall Street's bears and bulls come to prime time
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Once is a fresh idea; twice is a trend. That's
the way television operates.
</P>
<P>
   For years we've had legal dramas, medical dramas and cop dramas.
This season at least two networks hope the next big thing is the
financial drama.
</P>
<P>
   Churning, blow-out, garbatrage, hammering, IPO, OTC. The
rapid-fire lingo could become as impenetrable as the frantic
doc-talk on ``ER,'' but it didn't take us long to get used to crash
carts, chest cracking and stat!, now did it? The fact that there
are two business dramas on the horizon means that the subject is
out there, and TV is trying to cash in on it.
</P>
<P>
   TNT has ``Bull,'' the cable network's first original series. Set
in the pressure-packed world of Wall Street, it debuts Tuesday at 7
p.m. and spotlights a group of investment bankers and traders who
break away from an established firm to start their own company.
They're s than ``$treet.'' Michael S. Chernuchin, the former ``Law
&AMP; Order'' executive producer who created ``Bull,'' was inspired by
his own experience as a lawyer with a high-priced firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was sitting with three friends who were Wall Street
investment bankers, and they asked if I wanted to play golf the
following Saturday,'' Chernuchin said. ``They had leased a plane
and were flying across the country to Pebble Beach. I couldn't
believe that 25-year-old kids had that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernuchin also believes viewers will be attracted to the
financial milieu because so many people are playing the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is the new American pastime,'' he said. ``People
watch CNBC the way they watch ESPN. They follow the Dow and Nasdaq
like they were sports scores. Everyone seems to have a 401K or an
IRA. This phenomenon, with high finance being a great place to
explore a character, is what will attract audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if the market suddenly collapses?
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is market-proof,'' Star insists. ``If the market goes
down, the show stays the same. It's about the high-pressure
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Television series generally live and die by the appeal of the
characters, which makes you wonder if ambitious investment types,
who work 14- to 16-hour days, are even remotely interesting. Aren't
these workaholics about as exciting as calculating the Dow Jones
average?
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer is yes; the long answer is no,'' says
investment adviser Carl Stuart. ``That's because the vast majority
of people who go into the brokerage business either quit or fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your point of view, failure might be just as
exciting as success. Both new series presumably could burn through
characters like so many chunks of charcoal. Stuart compares the hot
young brokers of today to ``the gaggle of young commercial real
estate brokers who were making hundreds of thousands of dollars
'flipping' real estate'' (buying and selling for a profit in one
day) in the '70s and '80s. When the market was flush, they were
rich, but when the market cooled, they went bust.
</P>
<P>
   There's a line in ``Bull'' that says the average age of
millionaires in New York City is 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Stuart says. ``And the average age of bankruptcy is
probably that young, too. It's a bubble, and it will burst.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside could be compelling _ as long as the up side of the
market holds on long enough for the young characters to strike it
rich. A chronicle of Wall Street's hair-raising roller coaster
ride, along with the requisite dose of TV bed-hopping, could keep
``Bull'' and ``The $treet'' going. But only if viewers warm to the
cold-hearted milieu in the first place.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The widely held notion that Al Gore hired on the
overtly religious Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate in
order to wash himself of scandal raises an awkward question. Dare
we ask, ``What scandal?'' Two matters are charged against the vice
president's account, neither amounting to a hill of beans. (Teepen,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ SANDWICH, Mass. _ Listen carefully and tell me
what you hear. Car horns? Power lawn mowers? An '81 Oldsmobile
excreting trash-rap through its open windows? If you answered yes
to any one of the above, or heaven forbid, all of them, then you're
probably an average Joe, living on Main Street, Anywhere, USA. And
you're pretty used to the cacophony we've come to accept as a part

wished out loud for the old days of platform fights, credential
challenges, delegate walkouts and red-meat oratory that lambastes
the bad guys, exalts the good and whips the faithful into
spear-shaking battle readiness. Well, be careful what you wish for.

   STAR-DOC _ When Vladimir Chubinsky came to the U.S. in 1990, the
former Soviet wrestler turned physical therapist had no money,
spoke no English, and was supporting a wife and 4-month-old baby.
Now, he is a massage therapist to celebrities - including Jane
Fonda - and CEOs, and has developed a new fitness program called
``gravitational gymnastics'' that is part weightlifting, part
reflexology, and part energy healing. Chubinsky practices his
techniques with doctors, businesspeople, and celebrities in his
Sandy Springs Wellness Center. His clients claim amazing mental,
physical, and spiritual benefits, but scientists and conventional

former Soviet wrestler turned physical therapist had no money,
spoke no English, and was supporting a wife and 4-month-old baby.
Now, he is a massage therapist to celebrities - including Jane
Fonda - and CEOs, and has developed a new fitness program called
``gravitational gymnastics'' that is part weightlifting, part
reflexology, and part energy healing. Chubinsky practices his
techniques with doctors, businesspeople, and celebrities in his
Sandy Springs Wellness Center. His clients claim amazing mental,
physical, and spiritual benefits, but scientists and conventional
physicians are skeptical. He is currently seeking a patent for the
system as well as validation from scientific researchers at GSU and
the Marcus Institute. Someday, Chubinsky hopes to bring his healing

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSBURG, Calif. _ Gazing at acres of tomatoes ready for
harvest, third-generation California farmer Jeffrey Merwin said he
is living his childhood dream of working the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanting to farm since I was 5 years old, and I've
enjoyed doing it, until about the last year or so,'' Merwin, 38,
said, shaking his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   His dream has turned into a nightmare as he and scores of other
farmers in Northern California struggle with the financial collapse
of their fruit and vegetable processing cooperative, the
once-profitable Tri Valley Growers in San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   The financial woes at one of the largest canneries in California
have been brewing for at least a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Tri Valley posted sales of $960 million in 1995 but by the
fiscal year 1997-98 it announced a record loss of $53 million. That
figure was later revised to $79 million.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors promptly fired the chief executive,
Joseph Famalette, who now faces a class-action lawsuit involving
more than 500 farmers. They allege that Famalette fraudulently
induced the growers to approve the change from receiving cash from
the co-op's pooling system to receiving stock instead.
</P>
<P>
   The losses continued as the cooperative's debts mounted to more
than $400 million owed to at least 1,000 creditors. Last month, the
co-op filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to members of Congress, Bill Pauli, president
of the California Farm Bureau Federation, wrote Tri Valley's
decision to take only a portion of the contracted fruit from its
growers will translate into an estimated $200 million in losses
this year with 4,500 jobs lost for farm and cannery workers.
</P>
<P>
   Tri Valley's 500 members lost $35 million in payments not made
for 1999 crops and $145 million in lost equity (cooperative
dividends for which members have already paid taxes).
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Oakland approved a
$270 million financing package that will help the grower-owned
company process some fruits and vegetables this season.
</P>
<P>
   A large chunk, $169 million, will be spent to help pay off the
debt while $101 million will be used for processing crops. In
return, Tri Valley must try to sell its assets or go into
liquidation by Feb. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bailout, farmers are still expected to feel the
crunch because the money is not enough to process all of the
contracted crops.
</P>
<P>
   Tri Valley will take only 40 percent of the contracted tomato
acreage, 70 percent of the pears and apricots, and 85 percent of
the peaches, and all at a reduced price. The co-op will pay 70
cents on a dollar for peaches and 60 cents on a dollar of all other
crops.
</P>
<P>
   The move has left growers scrambling for new outlets in the
middle of harvest while most processing plants committed their
facilities to other farmers at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we're doing right now . . . is actively
working with a food broker who is trying to find the processing
capacity,'' said Merwin, who has 400 acres of tomatoes in south
Sacramento County.
</P>
<P>
   He still feels fortunate. Unlike some of his neighbors who are
contemplating bankruptcies themselves or potential foreclosures on
their farms, Merwin thinks he can squeak by this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in very close contact with my banker and the fact of
the matter is that we've been healthy enough over the years'' that
we can survive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is that in order to get out of the hole, you
need something that makes you money. . . . I'm fearful that we're
not at the bottom of the cycle yet. I think we've got another year
before we hit bottom and that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Peach, pear, apricot and tomato growers are expected to lose $60
million this year for crops that aren't processed and reduced
payments on deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has
announced it will buy 36 million pounds each of canned peaches and
processed tomato products and 64 million pounds of canned pears,
using funds set aside for fruit purchases when there is a glut in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USDA, at this point, I don't think is going to extend any
other assistance programs directly to the people affected by this
problem,'' said Enrique Figueroa, deputy undersecretary for
marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA. ``What may occur,
however, is for Congress to draft some legislation to specifically
target some of these affected growers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ First it was the Radio Flyer wagon. Then it was
the Hula-Hoop. Now it is time for the push scooter to relive its
glory days.
</P>
<P>
   If the rapid sales are any indication of their popularity,
scooters are rolling their way back into the hearts of children _
and adults _ and the momentum isn't slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell about 15 to 25 a day on average,'' said Erik Camacho,
sales associate at Sharper Image at San Antonio's North Star Mall.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, the Razor scooter, which sells for $99.95, has been
displayed at the trendy gadget store. But sales jumped recently,
and Camacho does not anticipate the popularity of the scooter will
lose momentum anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think it's going into Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-wheel Razor scooter, made by Taiwan-based J.D. Corp., is
among the best selling products for San Francisco-based Sharper
Image.
</P>
<P>
   The wooden footboards and metal skates of yesteryear have been
replaced with light-weight alloy and polyurethane wheels. The
device folds in half and is easy to tote. Its sleek appearance is
appealing and features an upright steering mechanism attached to a
narrow, chrome footboard.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels and handlebars come in a variety of colors _ red,
green, orange and the most popular color, blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always running out of blue,'' Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mad dash for the Razor, Sharper Image has been selling
fancier models like the Razor Wheel e, which allows the more
advanced rider to pop wheelies and pivot without losing balance.
Thirteen-year-old Jose Lopez jumped on the more expensive Xootr
($369) and took laps around the store while his mother checked out
the remote-controlled swivel air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more comfortable than walking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most transportation trends, the scooter experienced a
resurgence in coastal cities such as San Diego and San Francisco
before making its way across the country to New York. The scooters
are being used by children, but also by urban commuters and office
workers as a convenient form of transportation to and from meetings
and subway stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the Rollerblade's replacement,'' said Mary Ann
Crenshaw, the president of Mary Ann Crenshaw &AMP; Associates in New
York City. The agency manages public relations for the Children's
Place, a nationwide clothing chain.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Place sells a similar model called the Yaak for
$59.50. ``We saw how hot it is, and we're bringing it in at
half-price. Every kid wants one and we're out to please kids,''
Crenshaw said.

FEDERAL DRUG WAR UNDERMINES LEGITIMATE MEDICAL ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, when California voters passed Proposition 215, which
made the use of marijuana legal for legitimate medical purposes,
federal law enforcement agencies began a new war on drugs targeting
both the sick and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents have arrested and charged AIDS and cancer
patients in California, who used medical marijuana to ease their
pain and nausea, with violating federal drug laws. And the federal
government has threatened sanctions against California doctors who
provide candid medical advice to patients about the medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   It is a two-pronged attack that is meant to indirectly
intimidate voters who are compassionate enough to want medical
marijuana available for those it helps deal with their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana has been documented to relieve nausea and some levels
of pain in cancer and AIDS patients. Cancer patients taking
chemotherapy can suffer from intense bouts of nausea. AIDS patients
swallow a cocktail of drugs that can cause almost immediate nausea
and the inability to hold the drugs down. In some cases, the
usually prescribed drugs for nausea do not help, not even the
$40-a-pill, so-called Cadillac anti-nausea drug _ but a little
marijuana does.
</P>
<P>
   Before Proposition 215 was passed, California doctors routinely
encouraged some of their patients to try marijuana to relieve their
symptoms when traditional drugs didn't work effectively. But when
California and other states began to pass medical marijuana laws,
the Clinton administration panicked. The administration decided to
make an example of California by cracking down on its doctors and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been threatened with the loss of their prescription
drug licenses, suspension of medical licenses and even criminal
prosecution _ all for telling a patient that, in the doctor's best
medical judgment, the patient may benefit from the medical use of
marijuana and that from a medical perspective it would be advisable
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, possession of marijuana is illegal. Under
California law, medical use of marijuana is legal. Most Western
states have passed medical marijuana laws. There's a tug of war
going on between the federal government and the states on this
issue. Doctors and their patients are being trampled in this
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Under California's Proposition 215, marijuana distribution
centers will give certain patients medical marijuana without a
written recommendation from a doctor. Some centers only require a
diagnosis. A doctor's recommendation is not a prescription for
marijuana, but a doctor's recommendation does exempt a patient from
prosecution under state drug laws. Doctors can neither prescribe
nor dispense marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a
class action lawsuit in a federal district court on behalf of a
number of California doctors and patients. The lawsuit named Barry
R. McCaffrey, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control
Policy, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala as defendants. The lawsuit
requested a preliminary injunction against the defendants to stop
them and their agents from enforcing or threatening to enforce
federal laws that would penalize doctors for communicating with
their patients concerning the risks and benefits of medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and patients won the lawsuit. On April 30, 1997,
U.S. District Judge Fern M. Smith issued a preliminary injunction
to stop the federal government from threatening or prosecuting
doctors for recommending medical marijuana to their patients, for
providing a copy of the patient's medical chart to that patient or
for testifying in court regarding a recommendation that a patient
use marijuana to treat an illness.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote in her decision: ``Because the First Amendment
protects physician-patient communication up until the point that it
becomes criminal, defendants may not prosecute California
physicians unless the government in good faith believes that it has
probable cause to charge under federal aiding and abetting and/or
conspiracy statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The injunction was ineffective. The difficulty arose in defining
``recommendation.'' The federal government continued to contend
that a doctor can discuss medical marijuana, but not recommend it.
Nor would the government explain the difference between discussion
and recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after winning the lawsuit, doctors still felt they
would be prosecuted if they talked to their patients about the
medical use of marijuana. Therefore, they have remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lawsuit, the federal government had managed to
insert itself between doctors and patients and erect a wall of
silence under the threat of prosecution or sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Aug. 3, Graham Boyd of the ACLU's Drug Policy Litigation
Project urged a federal district court to permanently block the
federal government from gagging California doctors who think it is
good medical advice to recommend marijuana for specific patients.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Aug. 9, Boyd explained the reason for this
new legal action, ``When the government regulates in the area of
speech, it has to do so very carefully. When it tells us there are
certain things that we can say and other things that we are
forbidden to say, it needs to be very clear about where that line
is. Otherwise people, in order to make sure they don't violate the
law, will often steer well clear of the forbidden zone. So if the
government draws a line that is not clear, if they make
prohibitions that are vague, then it leaves the person who is being
regulated, leaves the doctor, really unable to determine what is
safe to say and what is potentially quite dangerous to say in terms
of their livelihood and staying out of prison. And therefore,
doctors will just avoid the subject altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in California simply want to know what they can say
about the medical use of marijuana and where it might be advisable
and still remain safe from prosecution. That's the reason for this
follow-up litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors are requesting a bright line, a clear demarcation
between legal speech and unlawful speech. Boyd spelled out the
ACLU's proposal for a bright line: ``The exact kind of
communication a doctor can make and the context in which he can
make it. So if a doctor says to a patient in the examination room,
'I recommend marijuana,' that's protected. It doesn't matter what's
in the doctor's head. It doesn't matter what the patient ends up
doing. That speech is protected. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that even that bright line will solve the problem
with a determined drug czar and a recalcitrant administration.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has done everything it could to block the
implementation of California's Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, with the number of states having passed medical
marijuana laws and states considering it on this November's
ballots, it is time for Congress to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could create an exception to the prohibition on the use
and possession of marijuana. It has done so for another Class I
drug, peyote. Peyote may be used by members of the Native American
Church _ for religious purposes only. Certainly, Congress can _ in
its concern for those who are seriously ill _ create a federal
medical exception for the possession and use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a federal exception would be the compassionate thing to
do. The right thing. And it would derail this intensifying clash
between states' rights and federal authority. One would think that
a conservative Republican Congress should want to give states their
proper due on this important issue.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Latino Committee 2000 Sunday brunch at
Paramount Studios included almost every top California Hispanic
politician, but was notable for one no-show: Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The second-term congresswoman from Orange County was on the list
of invited VIPs to the lavish event, which featured chicken
tamales, music by the band Culture Clash, and speeches on the
influence of Hispanics in politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez, criticized by the Democratic National Committee
over her plans for a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion, has kept a
low profile since the issue went public last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 40, caved in Friday and announced she was moving the
fund-raiser to B.B. King's Blues Club at Universal Studios'
CityWalk, a touristy street of restaurants and shops. In return,
Democratic leaders restored her speaking slot for this Thursday and
canceled their threats to consider ousting her as the highest
ranking woman in the Democratic Party. Sanchez is co-chair of the
Democratic National Committee, along with Detroit Mayor Dennis
Archer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about the Playboy Mansion,'' she said Friday.
``It's about putting on a good event and raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flap has brought successive waves of criticism for
Sanchez, who gained national attention in 1996 when she narrowly
beat incumbent Rep. Bob Dornan, a conservative Republican. First,
party leaders said the Playboy event could embarrass Vice President
Al Gore, then others criticized her for caving in to the moralists
and moving the event.
</P>
<P>
   Several people attending Sunday's brunch at the Paramount
Studios lot in Hollywood said they strongly support Sanchez,
despite the criticism. And few thought the flap would have any
lasting effect on the Democrats' popularity with Hispanic voters at
the polls in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalinda Guillen, political director of the United Farm Workers
in Sacramento, said she saw nothing wrong with Sanchez's Playboy
Mansion fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she doesn't apologize,'' she said. ``What does she have
to apologize for?''
</P>
<P>
   When Sanchez initially refused to move the fund-raiser, DNC
Chairman Joe Andrew stripped her of her scheduled speaking role at
the convention and threatened her position as a party co-chair. By
moving the event, she regained her speaking slot.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ``had to do whatever is in keeping with the tone (of the
convention), but I think it's unfortunate that it happened to
Loretta, who is a star,'' said Carmen Delgado Votaw, a Maryland
delegate to the convention. Votaw said Sanchez made the right
decision to move the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was flexible in order to stay in the game,'' she said.
``She wanted some of the limelight at this convention _ and she
deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanics believed that the national party officials
unfairly singled out Sanchez, noting that Playboy magazine founder
Hugh Hefner and his daughter, Christie, have donated money to the
Democrats and to the campaigns of President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all posturing for the conservative vote,'' said
Esai Morales, an actor who starred in the movie ``La Bamba.'' ``If
you can take money from Hugh Hefner, you shouldn't be hypocritical
about having an event at his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Hinojosa, an economics professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said Hispanics view the Sanchez-DNC feud
as a serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very sensitive to how national Latino politicians
are treated,'' he said. ``We haven't been in the spotlight that
long, so we wonder when we see this ton of bricks come down on
Loretta.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hinojosa said the event at Hefner's estate,
coming during the Democratic convention, would only have fed
Republican attacks. ``Everyone would probably agree that
politically it was not a very smart thing to do,'' he said.

PRESIDENT WAHID HAS DAUNTING TASKS AND LITTLE TIME TO SHOW
IMPROVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``i'' international
category) 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TOM UHLER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's in frail health and practically blind, and last week he
fell asleep as his state-of-the-nation speech was being read to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But for better or worse, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid,
a 60-year-old Muslim cleric, has inherited the daunting task of
building democratic institutions, practically from scratch, in one
of the world's most fractious nations.
</P>
<P>
   The annual session of the People's Consultative Assembly that
started last week and ends on Friday in Jakarta might have merited
scant attention in the United States if Indonesia were not the
world's fourth-largest country, its biggest Islamic nation and its
third-biggest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Wahid government could determine whether
Indonesia _ made up of 13,677 islands covering 741,000 square miles
with a population of 210 million _ continues its rocky experiment
with democracy or descends into political, economic and social
chaos. Its success or failure as an Islamic democracy will have a
huge impact on the rest of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   As if his political problems were not enough, Wahid has suffered
at least two diabetic strokes, has been blinded in one eye by
diabetes and can hardly see out of the other, and is overweight. He
relies on a host of advisers, and critics have accused him of
heeding advice from the last person he happened to be talking to,
including his masseur. Wahid's problems were apparent in June when
a group of U.S. journalists visited Jakarta on a Pew fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, members of the People's Consultative Assembly had
threatened Wahid with impeachment on numerous counts, such as his
failure to revitalize the economy and crack down on government
corruption. He was also accused by friend and foe alike of being
erratic and at times contradictory, and of allowing a sense of
drift to seep into his 10-month-old administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's problems are many _ legacies from the autocratic rule of
former President Suharto. Western diplomats and Indonesian leaders
told the U.S. journalists that several thorny issues demand
immediate attention:
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. Suharto's indictment (coincidentally
coming four days before the parliamentary session) was a milestone
in the government's crackdown on corruption and nepotism. Suharto,
79 and ailing, is accused of stealing $571 million in state funds
to finance business empires for his family and cronies. But Wahid
has said he will pardon Suharto if he is convicted. And Wahid's own
masseur has admitted taking $4.1 million from a government pension
fund; he later said he returned it.
</P>
<P>
   JUDICIAL REFORM. The government must somehow get rid of corrupt
judges, many of them left over from the Suharto years, when justice
was dispensed at a price. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has
said he is reluctant to file criminal cases because judges are
susceptible to bribery. In addition, the government must initiate
legal reforms after more than three decades of judicial fiat under
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   SECTARIAN, ETHNIC VIOLENCE. Sectarian violence in Aceh in the
north and Irian Jaya in the east, as well as ethnic clashes in the
Maluku islands, have claimed about 4,000 lives _ making a mockery
of the national motto, ``Unity in Diversity.'' Suharto sympathizers
have been blamed for instigating the violence to destabilize the
country's fledgling democracy. Some observers say that maintaining
Indonesia's ``national integrity'' is Wahid's most important task.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC DECLINE. Indonesia still hasn't recovered from Asia's
economic crash, which led to Suharto's resignation in May 1998
after 32 years. The currency, the rupiah, has lost 18 percent of
its value this year, trading at 8,725 to the dollar last week; the
stock market has plunged 27 percent; 60 percent of the population
is below the poverty line; and investment is way down because of
the instability.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's chief economic minister, Kwik Kian Gie, resigned his
post on Thursday. Kwik had been the government's prime contact with
the International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a
multibillion-dollar rescue and reform package. But he had done
little to pacify his critics, telling Dow Jones Newswires earlier
this year, ``If I were a foreign investor, I wouldn't come to
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY REFORM. Wahid has kept the once-mighty military out of
his administration and installed a civilian, Juwono Sudarsono, as
defense minister. But even though the police forces and military
were separated last year, they still operate under the Defense
Ministry, and their roles are ill-defined. Ironically, Wahid must
also revitalize a military that has suffered withering criticism,
initially for collaborating in ethnic killings and then for failing
to halt them.

   Wahid managed to mollify his legislative critics last week with
an apology for his government's shortcomings during his tenure.
After months of squabbling with the 700-member parliament, Wahid
acknowledged his weaknesses, vowing ``to do whatever necessary to
improve the performance of the government,'' according to reports
from Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to trim at least 10 members from his fractious
32-member Cabinet. On Wednesday, he appointed Vice President
Megawati Sukarnoputri _ the daughter of the country's founder,
Sukarno _ to oversee day-to-day affairs and bring order to his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has worked for now. Wahid's chief critic, Assembly
Chairman Amien Rais, told reporters: ``There will be no impeachment
during this session.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid also seems to have appeased anti-government protesters,
who have clashed with security forces during past political events
but not this one. The government might have pre-empted the
demonstrators by charging Suharto with corruption last week _ a top
demand of the protesters since Suharto was forced from office two
years ago. A judge in Jakarta told reporters on Tuesday that
Suharto's trial will begin before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only a reprieve for Wahid. Opposition legislators have
threatened to schedule a vote of no confidence or begin impeachment
proceedings if his performance doesn't improve soon. He was elected
to a five-year term in October but is subject to annual review.
</P>
<P>
   When he assumed the presidency in November, Wahid inherited a
bureaucracy that had been gutted by Suharto, who had the first and
last word in government matters. So in addition to dealing with
corruption, violence and a sluggish economy, Wahid must try to
erect democratic institutions where none existed.
</P>
<P>
   As formidable as his job might be, the president has little time
to show results. Rais told the visiting U.S. journalists: ``If
given one more chance and he doesn't perform well, I don't think he
will survive impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the event of Wahid's ouster is anybody's guess,
but it could lead to a surge in separatism and further division.
Western diplomats and his supporters are hoping that he can make it
through his five-year term and establish a democratic precedent in
Islamic Indonesia.

PRESIDENT WAHID HAS DAUNTING TASKS AND LITTLE TIME TO SHOW
IMPROVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``k'' commentary
category) 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TOM UHLER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's in frail health and practically blind, and last week he
fell asleep as his state-of-the-nation speech was being read to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But for better or worse, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid,
a 60-year-old Muslim cleric, has inherited the daunting task of
building democratic institutions, practically from scratch, in one
of the world's most fractious nations.
</P>
<P>
   The annual session of the People's Consultative Assembly that
started last week and ends on Friday in Jakarta might have merited
scant attention in the United States if Indonesia were not the
world's fourth-largest country, its biggest Islamic nation and its
third-biggest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Wahid government could determine whether
Indonesia _ made up of 13,677 islands covering 741,000 square miles
with a population of 210 million _ continues its rocky experiment
with democracy or descends into political, economic and social
chaos. Its success or failure as an Islamic democracy will have a
huge impact on the rest of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   As if his political problems were not enough, Wahid has suffered
at least two diabetic strokes, has been blinded in one eye by
diabetes and can hardly see out of the other, and is overweight. He
relies on a host of advisers, and critics have accused him of
heeding advice from the last person he happened to be talking to,
including his masseur. Wahid's problems were apparent in June when
a group of U.S. journalists visited Jakarta on a Pew fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, members of the People's Consultative Assembly had
threatened Wahid with impeachment on numerous counts, such as his
failure to revitalize the economy and crack down on government
corruption. He was also accused by friend and foe alike of being
erratic and at times contradictory, and of allowing a sense of
drift to seep into his 10-month-old administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's problems are many _ legacies from the autocratic rule of
former President Suharto. Western diplomats and Indonesian leaders
told the U.S. journalists that several thorny issues demand
immediate attention:
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. Suharto's indictment (coincidentally
coming four days before the parliamentary session) was a milestone
in the government's crackdown on corruption and nepotism. Suharto,
79 and ailing, is accused of stealing $571 million in state funds
to finance business empires for his family and cronies. But Wahid
has said he will pardon Suharto if he is convicted. And Wahid's own
masseur has admitted taking $4.1 million from a government pension
fund; he later said he returned it.
</P>
<P>
   JUDICIAL REFORM. The government must somehow get rid of corrupt
judges, many of them left over from the Suharto years, when justice
was dispensed at a price. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has
said he is reluctant to file criminal cases because judges are
susceptible to bribery. In addition, the government must initiate
legal reforms after more than three decades of judicial fiat under
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   SECTARIAN, ETHNIC VIOLENCE. Sectarian violence in Aceh in the
north and Irian Jaya in the east, as well as ethnic clashes in the
Maluku islands, have claimed about 4,000 lives _ making a mockery
of the national motto, ``Unity in Diversity.'' Suharto sympathizers
have been blamed for instigating the violence to destabilize the
country's fledgling democracy. Some observers say that maintaining
Indonesia's ``national integrity'' is Wahid's most important task.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC DECLINE. Indonesia still hasn't recovered from Asia's
economic crash, which led to Suharto's resignation in May 1998
after 32 years. The currency, the rupiah, has lost 18 percent of
its value this year, trading at 8,725 to the dollar last week; the
stock market has plunged 27 percent; 60 percent of the population
is below the poverty line; and investment is way down because of
the instability.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's chief economic minister, Kwik Kian Gie, resigned his
post on Thursday. Kwik had been the government's prime contact with
the International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a
multibillion-dollar rescue and reform package. But he had done
little to pacify his critics, telling Dow Jones Newswires earlier
this year, ``If I were a foreign investor, I wouldn't come to
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY REFORM. Wahid has kept the once-mighty military out of
his administration and installed a civilian, Juwono Sudarsono, as
defense minister. But even though the police forces and military
were separated last year, they still operate under the Defense
Ministry, and their roles are ill-defined. Ironically, Wahid must
also revitalize a military that has suffered withering criticism,
initially for collaborating in ethnic killings and then for failing
to halt them.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic party's convention, which opens
Monday, presents Vice President Al Gore with perhaps his best and
perhaps last major chance to win some credit for the country's
economic good times while distancing himself from the unsavory
elements of the Clinton administration that he has served for the
last seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The convention marks the final political ceremony before
full-fledged campaigning resumes. It comes two weeks after the
well-oiled Republican political convention in Philadelphia and less
than a week after Gore, who continues to run behind his Republican
opponent, George W. Bush, in the polls announced his choice for his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in a day given over to little substantive business,
the convention will focus its attention on President Bill Clinton
and his wife, Hillary, who is running for the Senate seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York. Both Clintons will
be delivering prime-time speeches. Gore, who is campaigning in the
Midwest, will not address the convention until its conclusion on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, with their campaign theme of looking to the
future, will open their convention by recalling the prosperity and
progress achieved under the Clinton administration. The trick will
be to celebrate Clinton without detracting from Gore's claim of
independence as the new Democratic contender for the White House.
His campaign has been encumbered by a fatigue that many voters say
they feel about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll of the Democratic delegates
coming to the convention to nominate Gore found that while they
viewed themselves as political moderates, their views on issues
from affirmative action to an activist federal government were more
liberal than those of the public or even other Democrats in
general.
</P>
<P>
   And a Gallup poll taken this last weekend and released Monday by
USA Monday and CNN reported that 47 percent of 641 likely voters
sampled said there was ``no chance whatsoever'' that they would
cast their ballots for Gore in November. Only 30 percent said the
same about Bush. Yet 68 percent of the likely voters sampled said
they considered Clinton's presidency successful, despite the
scandal over his relationship with the former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the convention is seeking to highlight Hillary
Clinton's campaign to represent New York in the Senate by
presenting six women who already are senators: Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland, Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein of California, Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas and
Patty Murray of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is then scheduled to deliver remarks before the
president is introduced with a film and makes his farewell address
as the party's leader. The convention is traditionally the time for
a departing president to pass the political torch to the candidate
nominated to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that the Clintons would steal the
limelight from Gore, making it harder for him to present himself as
a strong, independent leader. But Hillary Clinton promised on
Saturday that she and the president would only remain long enough
to endorse Gore's candidacy and then be ``gone, absolutely,'' from
the convention. The Clintons have irritated some Gore aides by
coming to Los Angeles over the weekend to raise millions of dollars
from Hollywood's entertainment industry for the presidential
library he plans to create in Arkansas and for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, the convention will also briefly pay tribute
to former President Jimmy Carter, who was defeated after a single
term by Ronald Reagan in 1980. That defeat began 12 years of
Republican leadership in the White House before the Texas
governor's father, George Bush, was ousted by Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Democrats will adopt a platform that competes
with the Republicans for voters in the political center. The
platform will call for schools to be made more accountable for
their students' performance, for tighter control of the country's
borders, for expanded world trade, for a stronger military and for
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats' platform will differ from the Republicans' in
its support for abortion rights, for mandatory trigger locks on
guns and for campaign finance reform. Gore has promised to make the
latter the first piece of legislation that he sends to Congress as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will also emphasize the legacy of the late
President John F. Kennedy, with speeches from his daughter,
Caroline Kennedy, and his brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, whom Gore defeated in
the early round of primaries, is also scheduled to speak, as is the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   As the delegates arrived at the Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles, protesters, espousing a variety of causes, from opposition
to the death penalty to vehement complaints about free trade, also
converged at the fences and police barricades erected around the
convention center. Thousands of police officers were on hand,
closing off major thoroughfares and some freeway exits and playing
havoc with the city's already chaotic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The convention offers an opportunity to make Lieberman better
known to the voters. The senator from Connecticut was kept busy
with talk shows and interviews Sunday. In an interview on CNN's
``Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer,'' Lieberman acknowledged that
``there have been some differences of opinion between Al Gore and
me. And I think it is a mark of his strength as a leader that he
didn't look for somebody who agreed with him on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator has differed from Gore in looking favorably on
school vouchers and some private retirement investment accounts in
the Social Security program, among other issues. But Lieberman said
he recognized that ``when the president decides, the vice president
supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the first Jewish candidate of a major party for
vice president. As the first Democratic member of the Senate to
formally criticize Clinton for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, Lieberman is seen as inoculating Gore against Republican
attempts to portray the presidential candidate as tainted by the
controversies surrounding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will address the convention on Wednesday, just before
Gore is formally nominated as the Democratic party's presidential
candidate. The delegations from Tennessee and Connecticut, the
respective states of Gore and Lieberman, have been placed in front
of the stage so their announced votes will be seen as putting Gore
over the top in the required number of votes. The vice president's
elder daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, will speak after the
formal nomination of her father.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has promised that his speech will be long on specifics,
spelling out his plans for trimming taxes for middle-class
families, improving the Social Security system, protecting the
environment and reforming welfare. And while he is likely to make
prominent mention of President Clinton's success in creating a
thriving economy, Gore has stressed that he is running on his own
agenda and with his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to be introduced by his wife, Tipper, who in
turn will be introduced by their younger daughter, Kristin, 23, who
lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual touch, after the speakers leave the podium, they
will each spend 10 minutes or so answering questions about their
remarks from designated Americans. These so-called ``chats'' will
be presented in webcasts between 8 and 11 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are using their convention to attempt to draw a
distinction between Gore and Bush that goes beyond political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Thursday the convention will offer a tribute to
Vietnam veterans, including Gore, who served there for seven months
as an Army journalist. Bush chose to serve as a pilot in the Texas
National Guard and did not go to Vietnam.

 &HT;    No one lost Texas, it just stopped hiding
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Communist take-over of China in 1949, outraged
Republicans demanded of the Truman administration, ``Who lost
China?!''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Republican take-over of Texas is a done-deal, the
party of LBJ and Sam Rayburn well might be asking themselves, ``Who
lost Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to put your finger on, but the same thing has happened
across the once-Solid South.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the national Democratic Party over the last 20 years
has done its part by becoming ever more liberal on the issues. Gun
control is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave the Democratic Party _ It left me!'' is the
common refrain for members of the new Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicanization of Texas has been more dramatic, perhaps,
than in the rest of the South because of its larger number of
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot at stake in the Lone Star State. At present, Texas
ranks No. 3 in electoral votes. Four years from now, it will likely
move to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing really has changed so much politically. Deep in its
heart, Texas has always been Republican, particularly evident on
the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Look at its voting history for presidents:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1952 and 1956, Texans liked everything about Ike.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1960, Kennedy won with LBJ on the ticket and, perhaps even
more than that, the massive turnout of Mexican-Americans in the Rio
Grande Valley voting for the Catholic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1964, LBJ beat Goldwater, but hardly anyone voted for
Goldwater anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1968, LBJ was able to deliver Texas to Hubert Humphrey _ just
barely; but third-party candidate George Wallace probably cost
Nixon the state.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1972, Nixon was the one for Texans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1976, Carter was able to carry Texas when fundamental
Christian voters mistakenly thought the born-again Georgian Baptist
was one of them politically.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1980 and '84, Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1988 and '92, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1996, Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Even in its years as a Democratic state, Texas's true political
leaning has always been to the right. You could find a scattering
of moderate and liberal Democrats tolerated at the statewide level,
but conservative Democrats ruled.
</P>
<P>
   And conservative Democrat was just another name for Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Shivers, John Connally, Dolph Briscoe _ most any Texas
governor in any year _ may have carried the label of Democrat but
was Republican to the core.
</P>
<P>
   (Ann Richards, who won by letting Clayte Williams beat himself,
was the only progressive governor in my lifetime, and you see how
long she lasted.)
</P>
<P>
   The accepted practice was for Texas Republicans to participate
in the Democratic primary in order to have a say in local and state
politics _ ignoring the ballot pledge that you were bound to
support the nominee of the party come November.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates who did try to run locally might never
mention party affiliation in billboards and media ads.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, Republicans eventually got to the point
where they could win local elections, even in the erstwhile
Yellow-Dog Democrat regions of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the party that dares not speak its name, the GOP
controls not only the governor's office and both U.S. Senate seats
but most every other aspect of state politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Democratic candidates who often avoid mentioning
party affiliation in their campaign material.
</P>
<P>
   Who lost Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Texas wasn't lost. It just finally came out of hiding.

&HT;     MAYOR TOUTS NEW SPORTS ARENA FOR SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ILENE LELCHUK and JENNY STRASBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown has a grand
plan for a sports arena on the waterfront. But he has no anchor
team. He has no guaranteed funding. And no clear path toward
approval from a key agency that oversees development along the San
Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor and the head of the Port of San Francisco have
invited a major Texas investment and development group, Olympus
Real Estate Corp. of Dallas, to San Francisco later this month to
lay out its vision for a 19,000-seat arena south of the Pacific
Bell Park, the stadium where the Giants baseball team plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do whatever needs to be done to complete the things
I've started before I'm out,'' said Brown, who has been floating an
arena plan for a few years. His term expires in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others advise caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may be a very good idea to build an arena in San
Francisco,'' said Marc Ganis, president of the Chicago-based
SportsCorp industry consulting firm. ``But there should be an
expectation that there will be major sports leagues flocking to the
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and Doug Wong, port executive director, visited Dallas
earlier this month to tour the $340 million arena being built by
Olympus and the Hillwood Development Corp., headed by Ross Perot
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Olympus is willing to sketch a preliminary design for
San Francisco at no cost to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Olympus President David Deniger said it is too early to
speculate about an arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, before you can start a project like that, you've
got to know what users are going to be there. But again, you're way
ahead of us,'' Deniger said.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey does not appear to be an option for the arena. The
National Hockey League Sharks are thrilled with their arena in
nearby San Jose and signed a 15-year lease in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As for basketball, the Warriors have had a troubled recent
history in Oakland but their spokesman declined to comment on
speculation about a move to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors, who started in San Francisco and moved to Oakland
in 1971, signed a new 20-year contract in 1997 to play in the
renovated Oakland Arena. They can kill the contract in 2007 if the
team pays Oakland all the remaining debt on the arena construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors already are in debt to Oakland for more than $17
million in back rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is (a new arena) should be a totally private
investment,'' said Oakland Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having trouble getting money from the A's,
Warriors, all of them. . . . There are not too many teams willing
to put their money where their mouth is,'' Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Wong said they do not want to rely on public
financing. But Olympus _ the real estate arm of high-powered Dallas
private investment firm Hicks Muse Tate &AMP; Furst Inc. _ did just
that in Dallas. Taxpayers are financing the new American Airlines
Center for the Stars hockey team and Mavericks basketball team with
up to $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he has received offers from other developers and
investors interested in a San Francisco arena but Olympus swayed
him, in part, by offering to draft some preliminary plans for free.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has solid relationships with professional
sports franchises: Tom Hicks, chief executive of Hicks, Muse, Tate
&AMP; Furst, is a majority owner of the Stars and the Texas Rangers
baseball team. Deringer is a minority partner in the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   At the waterfront, the new arena also could house circuses, pro
tennis tournaments, World Wrestling Federation matches and large
conventions, Wong said. Moreover, if the city ever wants to host a
major political party convention again, as it did with the
Democrats in 1984, a new arena is a must, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Winning government approval for an arena would not be easy.
Officials at the Bay Conservation and Development Commission
already are leery. The regional agency is charged with limiting bay
landfill and preserving public access to the water.

 &HT;    No one lost Texas, it just stopped hiding
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Communist take-over of China in 1949, outraged
Republicans demanded of the Truman administration, ``Who lost
China?!''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Republican take-over of Texas is a done-deal, the
party of LBJ and Sam Rayburn well might be asking themselves, ``Who
lost Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to put your finger on, but the same thing has happened
across the once-Solid South.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the national Democratic Party over the last 20 years
has done its part by becoming ever more liberal on the issues. Gun
control is as good an example as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave the Democratic Party _ It left me!'' is the

SURE BEATS WACHING CONVENTIONS ON TV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients on or after Aug. 14,2000) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the spectre of all local television programming being
ruined by boring convention or redundant civil unrest coverage this
week, concerned citizens might understandably wonder why
entertainment has to suffer when politics comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not necessarily the case. While our town _ more
specifically, Hollywood _ is not exactly known for making the kind
of trenchant political movies you'll find in the cinemas of, say,
Britain or Italy or Argentina, a solid body of astute work about
the American democratic process has developed over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   And our electoral system being what it is, many of these films
are pretty darn amusing. Here, then, is a list of 10 great
political films that you might want to rent in lieu of watching
this week's parade of empty speeches, prefab patriotism and broken
windows:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the King's Men'' _ This 1949, multiple Oscar-winner (best
picture, actor, supporting actress for Mercedes McCambridge)
remains American cinema's most perceptive look at populist
demagoguery. Adapted from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize
novel, this thinly veiled critique of Louisiana despot Huey Long's
rise and reign benefits from Broderick Crawford's overwhelming lead
performance and a sophisticated insight into the mechanics of power
politics that Hollywood hasn't matched in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being There'' _ A superbly pitched satire that gently but with
utter ruthlessness skewers the Media Age dumbing down of our
national debate. Peter Sellers is the mildly retarded gardener
Chance who, upon the death of his guardian, leaves home for the
first time in his life. Knowing nothing but how to care for plants
and what he's seen on television, Chance proves the perfect
pablum-spouting politician for an electorate threatened by real
issues and drugged by vague platitudes. If Sellers, who died a year
after this 1979 release, were still with us, he could fit right in
at both parties' sappy symbolism conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Roberts'' _ Tim Robbins' self-starring, 1992 comedy about
a right- wing ideologue running for the Senate under folksy
camouflage suffers a bit from its own lefty smugness. Still, it's a
marvelously scathing look at the partisan monster behind the
presentable mask, and a timely caution against taking glib
catchphrases like compassionate conservatism at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' _ It's hard to tell where fiction ends and reality
begins in Warren Beatty's hallucinatory, 1998 cry for a free and
meaningful contemporary politics. As the corrupted title senator
whose crisis of conscience goes hand-in-hand with a truth-telling
nervous breakdown, Beatty cuts a marvelously poignant ridiculous
figure. When he considered actually running for the Democratic
nomination last year, the poignance was noticeably missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Candidate'' _ This 1972 Robert Redford vehicle was a good
20 years ahead of its time, predicting as it did how telegenic
blandness would triumph over philosophical commitment by the 1990s.
Amusingly, the film's director, Michael Ritchie, attended Al Gore's
alma mater, Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave'' _ In a year when two fortunate sons of old political
families are trying to convince us they're champions of the average
guy, Ivan Reitman's 1993 fantasy about an everyday schlub's
successful misadventures as a presidential surrogate is a welcome
tonic. It's ham-prone Kevin Kline's best and subtlest film
performance, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabriel Over the White House'' _ Political looniness is hardly
a new phenomenon in America, as this utterly nutsoid, 1933 flight
of fascistic fancy demonstrates. Walter Huston is impressively
versatile as a corrupt, venal pol who, having recently been elected
to the highest office in the land, has a divine vision that turns
him into a zealous reformer _ who ain't shy about straightening
crooked America out at gunpoint. Alarmingly, the filmmakers seem to
condone his scorched earth approach to societal renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medium Cool'' Worried about potential violence between
demonstrators and police at this year's Democratic convention? Take
comfort in the fact that it couldn't be any worse than the
cataclysm that exploded around the party's Chicago conclave in
1968. Noted cinematographer Haskell Wexler was there, directing
this story about a cynical TV news cameraman's redemption odyssey,
and he got more than he bargained for when Vietnam protesters and
Mayor Daley's finest tore the city apart before his unblinking
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' _ While Frank Capra's work has
always been marred by sentimental hokiness, you'd be downright
un-American if you didn't leave this 1939 movie with misty-eyed
pride in our imperfect but wonderful form of government. Only Jimmy
Stewart could persuasively pull off the role of the naive young
senator whose inextinguishable decency survives assaults from all
quarters of the capital and even inspires the scoundrels there to
change their unscrupulous ways. Did I mention that Frank Capra's
movies never remotely resembled reality either?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wag the Dog'' _ Y'know, we're really gonna miss Bill Clinton.
No matter how untrustworthy, craven and downright dishonest our
next president will inevitably prove to be, it's hard to imagine
either contender inspiring a black comedy as entertaining as this
1997 tale of White House sexual misconduct, media subterfuge and
distracting military adventurism. And I do mean inspiring:
Remember, this movie was made before anyone had even heard of
Monica Lewinsky. A president who can generate so much entertainment
simply by being himself will be one hard act to follow.!end! &QL;

WELCOME TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
  It's not `Survivor' island,  
but it still takes some skill 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles is a vast metropolis whose many sights and wonders
simply cannot be seen in a mere five summer days without the
benefit of a little planning and a good respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in the media saturation and the vast number of parties,
protests and speeches going on during the Democratic National
Convent%, - 9elegates will be hard-pressed to come away from their
stay feeling like they really experienced L.A.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we'd like to offer our Ultimate Delegates Guide To
Los Angeles, an ``ideal'' scenario on how to enjoy your stay in the
nation's smoggiest _ check that _ make that second smoggiest city.
See, everything looks brighter already.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to imitate this itinerary, although, as our lawyers
urged us to point out, we're not responsible for anyone who
actually runs into O.J. Simpson in their travels.
</P>
<P>
   TODAY
</P>
<P>
   _3 p.m. Check into Westin Bonaventure. As you ride the glass
elevator with four reporters, be prepared to answer the same three
questions:
</P>
<P>
   1) Can Gore win?
</P>
<P>
   2) Any idea where the really good strip clubs are?
</P>
<P>
   3) Who will be the last castaway remaining on ``Surivivor''?
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to work up you're best ``no comment'' or
launch into an answer so longwinded the reporters will go pester
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   _3:45 p.m. As you emerge from hotel lobby onto downtown streets
be ready to dodge protesters rallying against the Gap and Banana
Republic and their alleged sweatshop practices. Make sure to untuck
your charcoal pique polo shirt so as to cover the Banana Republic
label on your Smithfield chinos.
</P>
<P>
   _5:30 p.m. Go to Shutters for wine tasting held by Napa County
congressman Mike Thompson. A little advice: Immediately hit the bar
in order to beat Ted Kennedy to the punch (so to speak).
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 p.m. Head to the People For the American Way dinner at
Beverly Hilton to chow down, but be prepared to duck if a fight
breaks out between Vice presidential pick and self-proclaimed
``culture warrior'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman and liberal producer and
free-speech advocate Norman Lear after Lieberman keeps harping on
how terrible ``Maude'' was. Luckily, Carol O'Connor will be there
to tell both of them to ``stifle it.''
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY
</P>
<P>
   _ 9 a.m. While breakfasting in the hotel restaurant beware of
reporters and Internet geeks who attempt to extrapolate your
preference for decaffeinated coffee into a treatise about how the
Democratic party is not as energetic and fun-loving as it once was.
With any luck Carol O'Connor will be there to tell the pests to
``stifle it.''
</P>
<P>
   _Noon: Go to California Gov. Gray Davis's luncheon at Union
Station but don't get on any trains or subways. You could end up at
Universal's CityWalk or even Santa Clarita for the rest of the day
_ or even the rest of your stay in town. _6 p.m. Ignore the boring
convention speeches by going to a reception hosted by Recording
Industry Association of America honoring Maryland congressman
Stenny Hoyer and his efforts to shut down Napster and keep music
``outrageously overpriced.''
</P>
<P>
   _10 p.m. _ At the ``Soul Train'' party at Paramount Studios be
prepared to call it a night after Sen. Barbara Boxer makes like
``Seinfeld's'' Elaine when ``Love Rollercoaster'' comes on.
</P>
<P>
   _11 p.m. _ As you return to hotel to watch a taped broadcast of
Clintons speaking on ``prosperity and progress'' be sure to gaze
out window at National Homeless Convention at Dome Village.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   _10 a.m. to 2 p.m. _ It's time to enjoy something of the city's
diverse culture. For a mere $500, take an organized bus trip to the
Hsi Lai Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights. Be content in your
newfound faith and knowing _ as an accompanying brochure notes _
that ``this is NOT a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   _5 p.m _. Enjoy yourself at happy hour with Irish delegates at
Jonathan Club. Carrol O'Connor is the designated driver.
</P>
<P>
   _8 p.m. _ Next up is Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez's planned
party for the Hispanic Coalition at the Playboy Mansion. But
beaware that the event, which has already run into image problems,
could run into more. There are rumors that George !ita!P. _ Bush
(the ``Ricky Martin of the GOP'' and nephew to George !ital!W _ and
grandson of George !ital!H. _) might crash the soiree and start
monopolizing the babes.
</P>
<P>
   _9:30 p.m. _ Then it's time to skip over to the Universal
Amphitheatre for the Hispanic Talent Showcase at Universal
Amphitheatre. This is as good as time as any to find yourself stuck
behind a slow-speed police chase on the Hollywood Freeway. Just sit
back an marvel at how all those TV copters manage not to smash into
each other. By the time you arrive, though, the concert's over so
you decide to return to Hef's and the event that's being delicately
described as the ``Gorgy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Midnight: _ About this time the president and Senator Kennedy
show up (even if the party gets canceled, they'll show up), and you
decide that maybe a good night sleep would be better than getting
caught up in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Than again maybe
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   _9 a.m. _ Begin your day at the House of Blues where United Auto
Workers host party honoring Michigan congressman John Dingell.
Anyone driving an American-made car to the event gets a dollar off
the valet parking!
</P>
<P>
   _11 a.m. _ Then pop down to Disneyland and get lost in
Fantasyland, which, afterall, isn't much different than a political
convention.
</P>
<P>
   _6 p.m. _ As Karenna Gore Schiff and Joe ``Let's Put `Friends'
In Movie Theaters'' Lieberman make nominating speeches for Gore,
duck out early to watch ``Survivor'' in your hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   _8 a.m. _ Waking up hung over and still bitter that right-winger
Rudy remains alive on ``Survivor,'' take your frustrations out by
heckling protesters on the street.
</P>
<P>
   _10 a.m. _ With Clinton, Kennedy, Hef and George P. Bush on the
loose, you realize you haven't found a date to Barbra Streisand's
concert tonight. Left with the unhappy prospect of actually having
to, gulp, actually go to the convention for the afternoon, you opt
instead to go back to your room and take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   _5 p.m. _ Refreshed, you give it one last try at Young
Democrats' happy hour at McCormick &AMP; Schmick's and get lucky. Now
you hope all those contributions (we mean donations, we mean ...
oh, whatever) _ and newfound Buddhist faith _ will put you on the
guest list for Babs' post-convention show at the Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   _6:30 p.m. _ As the vice president rambles on about ``Al Gore's
Vision For the Future,'' point out the pretty balloons overhead to
your date and remind her that Barbra will be on soon.
</P>
<P>
   _8 p.m. _ As you arrive at the Shrine you may think it's a a bit
gauche for the doorman to be holding out a bag asking for your
jewelry, but remember, you can always buy another Rolex and won't
be able to hear Streisand again until her !ital!next _ farewell
tour.
</P>
<P>
   _10 p.m. _ Babs caps the evening with ``Happy Days Are Here
Again.'' (You wonder if ``Send in the Clowns'' wouldn't have been
better?) Walking out, you wipe away a tear as your five day stay in
L.A. comes to an end. Then, of course, you can't get a cab. So you
walk back to your hotel. As L.A.'s finest round up the last
protesters, you find yourself humming ``The Way You Were.'' The
convention has already become misty, water-colored memories for
you.

NET ACCESS RIGHT UP CONVENTION'S ALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story is being transmitted to both lifestyle and
entertainment wires.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era that celebrates technology, political conventions have
proven no more immune than any other part of society in being
impacted by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's just taken a little longer for the impacts to be noticed,
because the 2000 Republican and Democratic conventions are the
first to be conducted at a time when more than half of all American
households have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Democratic convention, for instance, only drew a
handful of Web sites, most of them add-ons to established Old Media
operations such as The New York Times and ABC News, said Luis
Vizcaino, spokesman for the Democratic National Convention
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually involved one or two reporters in the back of each
room with a laptop,'' Vizcaino said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 Democratic National Convention will be a
state-of-the-art convention suitable for the 21st century,'' said
Vizcaino. Every Democratic delegate will have his or her own Web
page, scheduling and messaging services, to keep track of events
and gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Internet sites set up shop last week in the GOP
convention's ``Internet Alley'' portion of one of four media tents
in Philadelphia. And in the Democratic Convention's Internet Alley,
about 150 organizations are expected to set up booths, Vizcaino
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month-old Staples Center _ already something of a
technological marvel with its two TV production studios, 12,000
built-in phone lines, fiber-optics and other infrastructure _ has
been beefed up even further since Democratic Convention organizers
took over the facility June 9, said Staples Center director of
communications Michael Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more phone lines, 300 miles of TV cable, rooms for the
wireless transmission connections for roving reporters and special
air- conditioning units to cool TV equipment have all been added,
while more than 4,000 seats are being removed and more than 40
luxury skybox suites radically renovated to accommodate each
network's broadcasting needs, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest of Internet sites in Philadelphia were still
the Web operations for TV and cable operations such as MSNBC and
ABC News, even though both had significant separate areas elsewhere
in the media tents for their broadcast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to send a message to the new guys,'' joked
Mike Cornfield, a George Washington University professor of
political management and director of the Democracy Online Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by the amount of original content on these sites,''
said Phil Agre, associate professor of information studies at the
University of California, Los Angeles, and operator of a major
politically-minded mailing list called the Red Rock Eater News
Service. ``You (usually) need an audience to (be able to afford to)
produce original content. Maybe they're not getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield gave the partnership of ABCNews.com, the Washington
Post and Congressional Quarterly high marks for their combined Net
coverage of the GOP proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they had much to cover in a GOP convention so
tightly scripted that the schedule literally put aside two minutes
for a ``spontaneous demonstration'' of crowd support.
</P>
<P>
   The news-free situation was worsened for the dot-com crowd by a
Bush campaign decision to do virtually nothing that catered to the
Internet's particular needs, Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   During the GOP convention, a number of sites tried techie tricks
and gimmicks to attract attention, such as Insight.com, which
outfitted its reporters in Borg-like fashion, with a headset that
included a tiny eyepiece to view video, video camera, a
wrist-mounted keyboard and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bush Campaign decision not to do much with the Net
during the convention has disappointed them at the least and may
have hurt them,'' Cornfield said. ``I'm sure they're all hoping
Gore decides to be more aggressive at the Staples Center.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because big events such as the conventions are an
opportunity for a new medium to make a splash, if everyone
cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk for a candidate with online is you never know what
will happen to your message. You can't control it,'' Cornfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already under way, according to Agre, is an ``underground war of
e-mails,'' as partisans on both sides duke it out on
opposition-research sites such as www.bushcheney.net, the
Democrats' quickly launched spotlight on the voting records of the
GOP nominees, and www.goreline.come, the Republicans' equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But where those sites make it clear who's behind them, Cornfield
said, other, more vicious, and perhaps less accurate, sites won't
be this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as so-called independent expenditure groups are expected to
finance a series of single-issue attack ads in various battleground
states independent of the two campaigns, so too can attack Web
sites be expected to crop up with innocuous-sounding groups paying
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this intensified underground warfare going on,'' said
Agre. ``The grassroots groups such as Free Republic (a Fresno-based
conservative site at www.freerepublic.com) have already played a
huge role in these semi-, pseudo-, quasi-scandal stories that have
been kept alive. They create a sort of echo chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is not only trailing in the polls but has long
proclaimed his efforts to help fund the Internet in its early
years, is probably more likely to go Net in a big way at his
convention and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's apparently behind, so he has to take some risks,''
Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   There will not only be an Internet Alley at the Los Angeles
convention, but a ``Democracy Row'' of booths will be set up in the
convention center's West Hall, located maybe 100 yards from the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield also credited the so-called Shadow Convention with
doing a good job using the Internet to get people involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention, which will start at 6 p.m. today at
Patriotic Hall several blocks south of the Staples Center, is
focused on three issues, said organizer and columnist Arianna
Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty in a time of prosperity,'' the failings of the drug
war, and the corrosive effect of money on the political process,
Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential contender John McCain gave a rousing speech
at the Philadelphia convention on money in politics; Russ Feingold
of Wisconsin, will speak in the Los Angeles version, Huffington
said. Other speakers include rapper Chuck D, U.S. Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill
Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Their speeches and other work can be seen at
www.shadowconventions.com, Huffington said.

WALKING THE WALK AROUND L.A.
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody walks in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment was expressed _ somewhat energetically _ by the
New Wave band Missing Persons in the 1980s. And while there's still
some truth to the saying, there are a number of great places for
leisurely strolls in the area. The best 10 are offered here for the
benefit of Democratic National Convention visitors and any
residents suffering from seatbelt fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   _1. Old Pasadena: The appeal of a revitalized Colorado Boulevard
was considerably higher a few years ago before escalating leases
forced some of the funky independents out. But it's still a great
place to walk, window shop, dine in the open air, and check out the
restored buildings from Pasadena's old-money age. You'll find it on
Colorado between Pasadena Avenue and Arroyo Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   _2. Venice Boardwalk: You won't find the kind of sights depicted
in the video for David Lee Roth's ``California Girls,'' which was
filmed here, but this is always good for some of the best
oddball-viewing in L.A., particularly on weekends. Don't miss a
Venice institution, Muscle Beach, the outdoor weightlifting yard
just south of Windward Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   _3. Downtown water themes: Sunset magazine (August issue) hit on
this idea _ a water-themed walk through downtown. Highlights
include the Department of Water and Power moat, which serves as a
symbol of William Mulholland's success in sucking the Owens Valley
dry (111 N. Hope St.), then takes in the lively fountains of the
Music Center (Grand and 1st) before ambling alongside the brook
that babbles down the middle of the Bunker Hill stairs (Hope and
5th).
</P>
<P>
   _4. Hollywood Walk of Fame: Confine this one to the daytime.
You'll find more than 2,000 bronze stars set in pink terrazzo,
commemorating the careers of entertainment figures. Handed out to
those in movies, TV, radio, live performance and recording. Here's
a piece of trivia: Who's the only person to be honored in all five
categories? (Gene Autry). The stars line Hollywood Boulevard
between La Brea and Gower, and Vine between Yucca and Sunset.
</P>
<P>
   _5. Third Street Promenade: Kind of like the Old Pasadena scene,
but with considerably more funk. A revived stretch of 3rd Street in
Santa Monica between Wilshire and Broadway, it has clubs, pubs,
restaurants and book stores, but what really makes it hum is the
variety of its street musicians, poets and gadflies.
</P>
<P>
   _6. Rodeo Drive: This high-rent district stretches for only
three blocks in Beverly Hills, from Little Santa Monica Boulevard
to Wilshire, and despite its reputation, you're still liable to see
``sale'' signs in some windows. (The marked-down items still might
be out of your budget.)
</P>
<P>
   _7. Universal CityWalk: This is what Hollywood would look like
if the film industry could have concocted it from scratch _ a
squeaky-clean mix of entertainment, retail, drink and grub. It
recently underwent a significant expansion, and remains fiercely
cutting edge: a virtual-reality NASCAR race, a 3-D IMAX theater,
even a gourmet fast-food court.
</P>
<P>
   _8. Westwood Village: L.A. is a city whose tastes change
abruptly. When it's decided you're passe, you're dead. That
describes this area, which was sizzling in the 1970s but doesn't
generate much excitement now. Pity, because it's got a lot to
offer, notably in its record stores, book stores, movie theaters
and its live theater (Geffen Playhouse). It is bordered by Wilshire
on the south, UCLA on the north.
</P>
<P>
   _9. Laguna Beach: You're in luck _ the Sawdust Art Festival is
in town through Aug. 27. More than 180 artists from a variety of
disciplines are displaying their wares in a three-acre eucalyptus
grove in the canyon. The main drag through Laguna Beach is Pacific
Coast Highway.
</P>
<P>
   _10. Palm Canyon Drive: OK, so it is August, and the midday
temperature in Palm Springs hovers daily at around 141 or so. At
least they have misting machines at those sidewalk cafes. Try to
time your visit with VillageFest, a Thursday night street fair
featuring food, music and vendors' wares (Palm Canyon Drive between
Amado and Barristo roads). Palm Springs is a 110-mile drive east of
Los Angeles; around here, a piece of cake. &QL;

 BRITONS RAGE AGAINST SUSPECTED PEDOPHILES
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, England _ Some who live in this old harbor town
where Charles Dickens was born think there are too many people here
who resemble the creepiest of Dickensian characters, Fagin, a
nefarious, unkempt man who exploited and abused Oliver Twist and
other children.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Paulsgrove section of town, the literary parallel for
what is going on here was not penned by its most famous son, but by
Arthur Miller, the American author of ``The Crucible,'' a play
about the Salem witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the terraced houses of Paulsgrove there is a whiff of
hysteria in the air. In 17th-century Salem, it was witches. In
21st-century Portsmouth, it's pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   In Paulsgrove last week, mob rule was the only rule.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, on a warm summer's evening, young mothers and
their children surrounded the house of a suspected pedophile,
chanting: ``Sex case! Sex case! Hang him! Hang him!'' In the middle
of the baying mob, 4-year-old Shay Calvert stood aimlessly, sucking
her thumb and holding a homemade sign that read ``Kill the
paedophiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Shay was her daughter, Jodi Calvert beamed with pride,
saying, ``Yes, isn't she lovely?''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, luv, wave it, wave it,'' she urged her sleepy daughter,
who dutifully obliged, waving the sign and smiling meekly.
</P>
<P>
   Young men stood to the side, drinking beer. Earlier, they had
thrown stones, and one of them had punched a police officer,
breaking his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Kessell, a 33-year-old single mother of four, was the
self-appointed leader of the mob. Nearly every night for the past
week, she had led crowds of up to 200 people who had surrounded the
homes of suspected pedophiles. The mob bayed for blood, stones were
thrown, windows broken, people driven out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to protect our children, because the police can't,''
said Kessell, a chain smoker with spiked hair.
</P>
<P>
   But police say the mob is out of control. While one of the men
driven from his home by the crowd, Victor Burnett, 53, had been
convicted of molesting more than 100 children, four other families
who were intimidated into leaving are innocent, said the Hampshire
police superintendent, Bob Golding.
</P>
<P>
   They were guilty only of having the same name, or of bearing a
resemblance, or of having the misfortune of living next door to
alleged pedophiles who have been ``named and shamed'' in a Sunday
tabloid, the News of the World.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper began its campaign last month after an 8-year-old
girl, Sarah Payne, was found naked and murdered. The girl's
siblings told police that she had been abducted by a stranger. No
one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are innocent victims of gossip and rumor,'' Golding said
of the four families who were driven out of Paulsgrove in the past
week. ``There is nothing to suggest they had anything to do with
pedophiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, that is, except the list that Kessell waved around
furiously as if it were an indictment of the law enforcement and
government officials whom she and her neighbors were defying. In a
society where most people show extraordinary deference to authority
figures, some of those who live in Paulsgrove have taken matters,
and the law, into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Told that police say she and the mob she leads have driven out
innocent people, Kessell exhaled a long plume of smoke, shrugged,
and refused to accept responsibility. She considers them collateral
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fault of the police and social services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't put pedophiles on this estate and among our
children, their neighbors wouldn't be receiving any aggro,'' she
said, using a slang word for aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   Kessell said her list of 15 to 20 ``known pedophiles'' in the
housing project, or estate, of 16,000 people was compiled from the
Internet, court documents, and by listening to the police radio.
</P>
<P>
   Golding said the list is bogus, more a product of rumor and
personal vendettas, which have led people in the mob to throw out
the name of a person they don't like. The names get added on, no
debate, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of mob rule is not limited to Portsmouth. Since
July 23, when the News of the World began printing the names,
pictures, and hometowns of people it said were pedophiles,
vigilante justice, and mistakes, have cropped up across England.
</P>
<P>
   Several suspected and convicted pedophiles have killed
themselves over the past two weeks. One of them, James White,
committed suicide after a mob attacked his home near Manchester.
White's lawyer, Milton Firman, blamed his death on the hysteria
created by the News of the World. The mob was led to his door by a
mention in a local newspaper that he had pleaded guilty to
molesting three girls.
</P>
<P>
   Many have noted the irony that such a high-profile,
self-righteous campaign against pedophiles was launched by Rupert
Murdoch's News of the World, a tabloid that routinely runs
photographs of naked women, and which critics accuse of sexualizing
everyone, including teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from police, which it relies on for many
of its sensational crime stories, the tabloid relented Aug. 4,
saying it would cease its name-and-shame campaign. But it has
threatened to resume it if the government does not create a public
register of pedophiles. And the mobs it spawned continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officials say that about 97 percent of convicted
pedophiles had regularly reported to them as required before the
newspaper began naming and shaming them, but the number dropped
dramatically in the hysteria created by the campaign. In the United
States, the compliance rate with registration laws for sex
offenders is about 89 percent, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While it refuses to divulge the sources of its information, the
News of the World has made mistakes. One man it named had died five
years earlier and had never been convicted of molesting children.
Acting on the newspaper's photos and names, the mobs have made
mistakes more frequently, attacking the homes of people who have
the misfortune of sharing a name or a resemblance with one of those
named.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Corbett, the chairman of Parliament's Home Affairs Select
Committee, asked the British government to prosecute the News of
the World for inciting violence. The newspaper remains defiant.
</P>
<P>
   While the mother of the girl whose murder inspired the newspaper
has backed the tabloid's campaign, saying parents need to know the
identity of pedophiles so they can protect their children, she
begged the mobs in Paulsgrove and elsewhere to end their violence.
She said the mobs were discrediting efforts to create a community
notification system modeled after ``Megan's Law,'' named for a New
Jersey girl murdered by a sex offender who was living next door
unbeknownst to her parents. Supporters want to call it ``Sarah's
Law'' in honor of the murdered English girl.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the Rev. Gary Waddington, sitting on the couch
in the vicarage across the lane from St. Michael's and All Angels
Church, was trying to prepare a sermon that would urge his
congregation to take a longer view of what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Waddington, an Anglican, believes that pedophiles have to be
reintegrated into the community _ indeed, he believes there is less
chance they will commit new offenses if they become part of a
community and have an incentive to follow its mores.
</P>
<P>
   But Waddington is sympathetic to the mostly poor community he
serves. Many in Paulsgrove are frustrated by their poverty and
their powerlessness, and he sees the angry epithets directed at
pedophiles and police as a cry of frustration over other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Paulsgrove is unremarkable. It's not a horrible,
rough community. In lots of poor communities, what often comes
across as aggressiveness and anger is simply frustration at not
being able to find middle-class political language,'' Waddington
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people here believe that pedophiles are being dumped here
by the government because this is a poor community where no one has
the power to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waddington's sympathy stops with the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hysteria breeds fear, fear breeds prejudice, and it allows
people to engage in vendettas,'' he said. ``This has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Golding hopes it has. After police and local officials promised
they would offer new housing to any suspected pedophile in the
neighborhood, Kessell and her supporters called off Thursday
night's planned rallies. But they vow to resume them if the
authorities don't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside St. Michael's, watching her 5-year-old son
Charlie like a hawk, 30-year-old Patricia Smith said she and her
neighbors are only demanding their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the government would relocate pedophiles to
middle-class estates, or put them in posh places?'' she asked. ``So
why should we put up with them? Are our kids not worth as much?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that there are simply too many children here, and
that the pedophiles must go elsewhere. Just where, she didn't know.
Or care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a hole in the ground, the council (local
government) would be expected to put up a sign warning children and
their parents. This is no different,'' she said, stressing that she
opposes the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say forcing pedophiles out of stable neighborhoods
only makes them more likely to commit new offenses. Parents like
Smith don't want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we move all the pedophiles to Downing Street? They
can live next to Tony Blair,'' she said, referring to Britain's
prime minister. ``See how he likes it.''

DR. LAURA BETTER FROM A DISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger _ or, as her legion of radio patients
simply refer to her, Dr. Laura _ has come aggressively under fire
of late for unkind remarks aimed at gays and a seemingly intolerant
demeanor in general. A doctor _ which Schlessinger may be, but not
of psychology or psychiatry, which is what she pretends to practice
on the air _ would obviously be a country mile more tolerant of
homosexuality. Moreover, few therapists openly berate their
patients, as Dr. Laura delights in doing on her highly rated,
nationally syndicated radio show _ unless of course they moonlight
as a dominatrix.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dr. Laura's bringing her act to TV with a syndicated series
that debuts Sept. 11. Gay groups have protested her show before it
even airs _ as close as the Paramount Studio lot (the studio is
producing the show) and as far aways a small town in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura herself, understanding the levels of controversy she
engenders, courageously avoided meeting with the nation's TV
critics in July, but she did post a message on her Web site
bullying fans into buying her advertisers' products. She wrote, ``I
am encouraging _ no, insisting _ if you value our relationship as
much as I do _ that you support these loyal sponsors by using their
products and services whenever you have the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   How will her patented brand of bile play on TV? Based on a
recent taping of the series _ only the sixth episode in the can _
it seems she's toning down her act for viewers. Protesters needn't
worry _ judging by what we saw, the only thing her show will
inspire viewers to do is nod off.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Dr. Laura is emboldened to insult and batter her
subjects when they're safely distant, on the other end of an
anonymous telephone line; when someone standing right next to her
makes a nitwit statement, on the other hand, she isn't nearly so
combatant. And she brings in guests and cronies to make her points
for her on the show, reserving fairly safe targets for her own
fusillade of snipy comments.
</P>
<P>
   The episode I sat in on was entitled, promisingly enough,
``Putting the Jail in Jailbait.'' But instead of inspiring a
``Jerry Springer''-style melee of confrontations and exhibitionism,
Dr. Laura served as ringmaster for a terribly clinical discussion
that grew increasingly pedantic, in a blase sort of way, as the
show dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   I was one of as few as three _ and maybe up to eight _ people
who wasn't getting paid to sit in her audience and cheer (so one
might reasonably ask, who's the dope in this equation?). Now,
bringing in busloads of ringers and promising them enough beer
money to induce them to feign enthusiasm for a program is a
standard practice in the industry, but in Dr. Laura's case it also
means that no screening process is necessary to weed out those
pesky gay activists who might act out against her.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the episode's theme, a group of teens was
among the hired hands. One, sporting a navel ring and T-shirt that
read ``Hottie'' (just Dr. Laura's kind of gal) asked a page, ``Will
we see any celebrities here?'' The page responded, ``No, Dr. Laura
looks at issues.'' The self-proclaimed hottie's eyes promptly
glazed over. Nonetheless, the audience _ most of which didn't
really seem to recognize their host _ was professionally attentive
and applauded a few notches above ``listlessly'' when instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura's set, situated in a Canoga Park soundstage, is a
tastefully designed in-the-round number highlighted with wood
accents and earth tones. Surrounded by roughly 180 seats, Dr. Laura
either sits with guests at a triangular desk or stands next to an
ultra-thin TV monitor as she dispenses her wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The show's officious floor manager sported long graying-blond
hair, a navy sport coat and tie, and moccasins. It was hard to tell
if his jacket and tie were in deference to working with Dr. Laura,
or if the long hair and moccasins were in deference to working in a
``creative'' industry (which isn't out of the question, since he at
one point boasted of his golf handicap).
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the audience not to pick their noses during the
taping (lest they be immortalized on the show with a
nostril-obscured digit). When the director messed up, he servilely
told Dr. Laura, ``We'll spank him for you,'' to which Dr. Laura
replied, ``Too kinky for me.'' He also stopped the taping at one
point to scold a group of teen-age girls who had the bad form to
come down with a case of suppressed giggles while sitting
prominently in the background of a shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode I witnessed, Dr. Laura _ clad in black save for a
longish powder-blue jacket (a couple of female floor assistants
copied _ coincidentally? _ the powder-blue and black color scheme)
_ railed and railed against men who would take advantage of what
she referred to, at one point, as ``young female girls.'' Outside
of a handful of Humbert Humberts in this world, is there really
anyone who could conceivably come to the defense of such people?
The fish Dr. Laura was shooting weren't in a barrel; they were in a
thimble.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of her guests were women who had gotten pregnant as
teens at the, um, hands, um, not !ital!hands _ well, you know _ of
significantly older men. One was humiliated by her experience, but
not so humiliated that she wouldn't talk about it on national
television, while the other, now in her 30s, seemed to have gotten
over her travails, maintained a good relationship with her family
and in general was pretty well-adjusted. Which didn't really seem
to jibe with the soberly cautionary tone of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The good doctor also had a couple of guests who worked at local
women's shelters _ curiously, one of these was the sole person she
did sort of harangue _ who didn't seem to subscribe to their host's
notion that older men exploiting younger women was a phenomenon
that could be stopped cold in its tracks. Having flogged the older
guy/younger woman dead horse to even further death, she then
shifted gears to discuss teens having sex with one another.
Surprise, she's against that, too.
</P>
<P>
   She dragged out a couple of pre-approved teen-agers who
announced that they intended to wait until marriage before they had
sex (to desultory audience encouragement). She then turned to an
Orthodox Jewish family friend, who sternly lectured the crowd that
the purpose of dating is a serious one; find a suitable mate;
undertaken with utmost gravity; blah blah blah blah. As comedowns
go, this ranked up there with Bill Buckner's tank job in the '86
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the teens _ and their parents _ were frightfully
inarticulate, but since Dr. Laura missed her cue to go to
commercial nearly every segment and often by more than a minute,
there'll be a lot that can easily be trimmed from the episode to
thin it down to broadcast length. The show concluded with the
results of a poll conducted on Dr. Laura's own Web site, which
found that 38 percent _ of her own fans _ didn't believe teens
should be thrown in jail for having sex before the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Duly scandalized, Dr. Laura ranted against the idea of
teen-agers having sex _ though, to be honest, it seemed more to be
a rant against the idea of teen-agers in general _ and then we were
sent home. But not before they shot a series of reaction shots _
people laughing on command at nothing in particular, to be inserted
into the show at sundry points to make Dr. Laura look even funnier
than she really is, one supposes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura seems adamantly incapable of understanding why anyone
would want to do anything besides toe the straight and narrow path,
though there exists a batch of photos that suggests she once was
capable of straying herself. But people like Dr. Laura are resolute
in their quest to ``rescue'' others from dabbling in the same sorts
of lifestyles that they themselves may have indulged in, even
though it's apparent that youthful rebellion doesn't automatically
result in a squandered adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Look, for an easy example, at Dr. Laura herself _ she sowed some
wild oats and made a few mistakes, but that hasn't prevented her
from becoming a phenomenal success story. George W. Bush partied
heartily into middle age, and now he's only a few micro-manipulated
Presidential debates from kicking his reptilian-skinned cowboy
boots atop the desk in the Oval Office. Some of those who fare
worst in their adulthood, in fact, are timorous souls who quivered
under the domineering reigns of oppressive parents who
psychologically cudgeled their progeny and prevented them from ever
making a life for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But hey _ guys who complain about people who tell others what to
do shouldn't tell those people what they should be doing, so I'm
not about to suggest Dr. Laura change her imperious ways. It's
pretty clear it's all showbiz anyway _ just another
attention-grabbing shtick in a town that can never have too many of
them. Based on what I saw, however, it seems pretty safe to say
that Dr. Laura's far more in her element on the radio than before
the cameras. &QL;

HOPES FOR PEACE IN AFRICA FADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The winds of war in central Africa are gusting
heavily as efforts to come up with a peace plan in Burundi hit a
brick wall and Congo's president launched major new offensives deep
into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of events heightened fears that this region,
torn by ethnic warfare almost continuously for seven years, is
descending into a new round of bloodletting despite the efforts of
Nelson Mandela, the United Nations, and others to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   In a region of genocidal ethnic conflicts, security analysts had
hoped that a peace deal to end Burundi's long-running civil war
might curb Congolese President Laurent Kabila's appetite for war,
since his forces include many rebel fighters from Burundi. But as
he attempted what appeared to be a major escalation of his war
effort this week, international observers began to fear a new
ethnic calamity. Backed by extremist Hutu militias from Burundi and
Rwanda, Kabila has vowed to overthrow the ``Tutsi regimes'' that
rule the two small countries on his eastern border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burundi is critical,'' said Jan van Eck, a consultant to the
faltering peace talks. ``Its peace process has to show that the
Tutsi-Hutu problem can be solved. Unfortunately, the arming of
Burundi's rebellion is undermining the possibility of success.
Kabila's strategy is to allow Rwanda and Burundi to be destabilized
by their own rebel militias operating from Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-year old war in the Democratic Republic of Congo has
been virtually deadlocked for a year, with Rwandan-backed rebels
controlling most of the east of the country and Kabila entrenched
in the west. Until now, neither side has seemed capable of moving
beyond the existing front lines.
</P>
<P>
   But security analysts say Kabila has been rebuilding his army
while teasing peace talks forward. His military strength is
unknown, and UN officials doubt he has the power to push clear
across the country, but he seems prepared to try. Last month, in an
ominous sign of his intentions, he blocked the UN from deploying
peace monitors and declared null and void a cease-fire accord he
had previously signed. This week, he was a no-show at a regional
summit called to discuss the war in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila's intentions have always been consistent,'' said a UN
official monitoring the war in Congo, who spoke on condition he not
be identified. The peace process, for Kabila, ``was a ploy to let
him regroup and rearm.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the gloom, talks meant to culminate later this month
in a deal to end Burundi's seven-year civil war appear to stall
this week, as rebel factions rejected a draft accord and warned
that peace was ``very remote.'' No one would say the process had
collapsed, but rebel attacks around the capital of Bujumbura have
intensified in recent days. A rebel ambush outside the capital last
Sunday night left 27 army cadets and seven civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Tutsi hatred that has fed cycles of war and genocide in
the region has been rising to dangerous levels for months,
observers said. The Tutsis form powerful but threatened minorities
that dominate the military and governments in Burundi and Rwanda.
Tutsi rebels also hold broad swaths of eastern Congo, where
residents say with growing resentment that they live under Rwandan
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when radicalized Hutus slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus in Rwanda, the pivotal issue in achieving
stability for the region has become the need to provide security
for the Tutsis, despised and besieged since the 1950s by the Hutu
majorities in Burundi and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   A Tutsi-led army eventually defeated the Hutu government that
launched the genocide, but the problem didn't end there. Roughly 1
million Hutus fled into eastern Congo to avoid revenge and
prosecution. Most refugees have since returned home, but perhaps
tens of thousands of former soldiers and Hutu extremists, known as
interahamwe, remain in exile in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda fears these Hutu militias are bent on completing the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In next-door Burundi, the Tutsi-led government harbors similar
fears. The country's civil war started seven years ago when Tutsi
paratroopers raided the presidential palace and killed several
prominent Hutu politicians, including then-President Melchior
Ndadaye. Two Hutu rebel factions have since taken up arms against
the government, and more than 200,000 people have died in the
ethnic fighting. Hundreds of thousands of Hutus have fled into
refugee camps in western Tanzania or into the forests of eastern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, backed by Rwanda, toppled Zaire's longtime dictator,
Mobutu Sese Seko, in May 1997. Since then, he has turned against
his former allies, stoking anti-Tutsi sentiments to build political
support.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Security Council, which authorized a modest peace
monitoring mission early this year, is due to meet later this month
to discuss the ongoing crisis in Congo, and regional leaders have
called for a meeting with Kabila on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Congolese leader turns his back on peace, some in the
region looked for hope in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cease-fire in Burundi would have a positive impact on
eastern Congo, where a lot of the Burundian rebels are hiding,''
said Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months since Mandela agreed to mediate the Burundi
talks, he has prodded the nation's 19 political parties closer to
an accord that would oversee a transition to majority rule.
Optimistic, he set a deadline of August 28 for signing an
agreement, even though the parties still disagree on key points,
including who would head a transitional government.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela also has yet to bring the two rebel armies formally into
the talks, and observers worry that even if a peace accord is
signed, it will be hollow without a cease-fire. Two separate tracks
of negotiations, in Pretoria, South Africa, and Arusha, Tanzania,
made little progress this week in clearing these obstacles, said
Van Eck, the consultant to the talks. Without the rebels on board,
Mandela's deadline now seems out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   As the crises in central Africa deepen again, the UN official
said the faltering talks in both Congo and Burundi illustrate the
need to find a regional formula for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congo is pulling Burundi back away from peace,'' the official
said. ``The Hutu rebels won't let Burundi be peaceful by itself.
There has to be a regional solution.''

DR. LAURA BETTER FROM A DISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger _ or, as her legion of radio patients
simply refer to her, Dr. Laura _ has come aggressively under fire
of late for unkind remarks aimed at gays and a seemingly intolerant
demeanor in general. A doctor _ which Schlessinger may be, but not
of psychology or psychiatry, which is what she pretends to practice
on the air _ would obviously be a country mile more tolerant of
homosexuality. Moreover, few therapists openly berate their
patients, as Dr. Laura delights in doing on her highly rated,
nationally syndicated radio show _ unless of course they moonlight
as a dominatrix.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dr. Laura's bringing her act to TV with a syndicated series
that debuts Sept. 11. Gay groups have protested her show before it
even airs _ as close as the Paramount Studio lot (the studio is
producing the show) and as far aways a small town in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura herself, understanding the levels of controversy she
engenders, courageously avoided meeting with the nation's TV
critics in July, but she did post a message on her Web site
bullying fans into buying her advertisers' products. She wrote, ``I
am encouraging _ no, insisting _ if you value our relationship as
much as I do _ that you support these loyal sponsors by using their
products and services whenever you have the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   How will her patented brand of bile play on TV? Based on a
recent taping of the series _ only the sixth episode in the can _
it seems she's toning down her act for viewers. Protesters needn't
worry _ judging by what we saw, the only thing her show will
inspire viewers to do is nod off.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Dr. Laura is emboldened to insult and batter her
subjects when they're safely distant, on the other end of an
anonymous telephone line; when someone standing right next to her
makes a nitwit statement, on the other hand, she isn't nearly so
combatant. And she brings in guests and cronies to make her points

fusillade of snipy comments.

ELITIST PREP SCHOOL IN D.C. IS GORE'S LITTLE SECRET

</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the Democratic convention will be harangued with
endless hay-strewn yarns about Al Gore's rustic Tennessee
childhood, but they will not hear one word about the place where
Gore spent most of his formative years: St. Albans School.
</P>
<P>
   Gore captained the Bulldogs football team, led the Government
Club, and graduated 25th out of 51 students in the class of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The veep's in good company. The Washington, D.C. prep school has
become the spawning ground for the Democratic Party. Sen. Evan Bayh
of Indiana, who was short-listed for Gore's running mate, is a St.
Albans alumnus. Fellow short-listee Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts attended St. Albans for several years. Rep. Harold
Ford Jr., the convention's keynote speaker and the youngest member
of Congress, was in my class at St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   We were several years behind Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., another
rising young black congressman.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore daughter and adviser Karenna Gore Schiff prepped at the
National Cathedral School, St. Albans' sister institution.
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans embarrasses Gore and his party. Gore never mentions
that he went there. All the St. Albans pols skip the school in
their official biographies. When he was being considered for
running mate, Kerry went so far as calling a reporter (still
another Albanian, Brit Hume) to emphasize that he had left St.
Albans and graduated from a different high school.
</P>
<P>
   The bashfulness is understandable. St. Albans is a snooty,
elitist, inside-the-Beltway institution. The people's party fears
association with an all-boys private school that costs nearly
$20,000 a year, has a ``refectory'' instead of a ``cafeteria,'' and
prides itself on its noblesse oblige. (Gore is, however, inoculated
from St. Albans attacks by the Bush campaign: George W. Bush's
younger brothers Neil and Marvin are graduates.)
</P>
<P>
   How did St. Albans, which is not even one of the nation's most
celebrated private schools, assume such a central role in American
politics?
</P>
<P>
   Prep schools, of course, occupy a hallowed, if horrible, place
in the story of the American establishment. As Nicholas Lemann
chronicles in ``The Big Test: The Secret History of the American
Meritocracy,'' the boarding schools of New England molded the
American Protestant aristocracy from the late-19th century to the
mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The schools enforced muscular Christianity: The football field
was more important than the classroom, and character was,to quote a
favorite St. Albans phrase,''choosing the hard right over the easy
wrong.'' The schools were intended to ``prevent very rich boys from
turning into playboys or pantywaists,'' Lemann writes.

   Founded in 1909, St. Albans served as the D.C. outpost of the
New England prep schools. Under a series of imposing headmasters,
the Episcopal cathedral school earned a reputation for academic and
athletic rigor. The D.C. elite gravitated to it. It was respectable
and Protestant, it won students admission to top colleges, and its
politics were liberal enough not to chagrin Democratic parents: St.
Albans integrated in 1954, early for D.C. private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even after standardized tests broke the prep schools' chokehold
on the establishment in the '60s, St. Albans remained a bastion of
the D.C. aristocracy. Vice Presidents Dan Quayle, Walter Mondale,
and Al Gore deposited their sons at the Lane-Johnston building. So
did dozens of senators, including Ted Kennedy and John D.
Rockefeller IV, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. and Jordan's
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason St. Albans mints politicians is
genetic. The best indicator of a boy's career is his father's. St.
Albans enrolls lots of political sons because of its location and
reputation, and they frequently follow Dad into politics. Most of
the St. Albans grads turned pols _ Gore, Bayh, Ford, and Jackson _
are the oldest sons of politicians. They probably would have run
for office if they had attended PS 152.
</P>
<P>
   But biology is not destiny. St. Albans also steers its boys into
politics. The school acclimates students to Washington. It offers
courses on political theory, American government, American
citizenship, and macroeconomics. Pols are regularly carted in to
speak at assemblies and graduations.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious extracurricular activity is the Government
Club, a Thursday night political debate between the ``Liberal'' and
``Conservative'' parties. (Both Gore and Ford served as Liberal
presidents.)
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans still clings to the (now-unfashionable) idea of
noblesse oblige. When boarding schools began losing their
influence, most of them shucked their haute-WASP traditions and
modernized with a vengeance. They adopted coeducation,
multiculturalized their curricula, abandoned dress codes, and
generally distanced themselves from the civic-minded condescension
that had defined them.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Albans hardly wavered from its traditionalism. It is
much more like old boarding schools such as Groton than Groton
itself is. Chapel is still a twice-weekly requirement. The dress
code is rigid. Coeducation is unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools de-emphasized sports, but St. Albans recently
upped its athletic requirement and added such high-suffering,
high-teamwork sports as crew and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The school unashamedly exhorts service as an obligation of
privilege. At every chapel and ceremony, the headmaster drummed
into our swelled heads our duty to help those poor, benighted souls
not fortunate enough to be Albanians. (Students are sardonic about
this, but they don't resist. A recent anti-Gore editorial in the
St. Albans student newspaper commented dryly: ``St. Albans for good
reasons encourages self-confidence [we are going to run the country
in a few years, right?]'')
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans imparts its high Episcopal arrogance to a different
kind of boy from the WASPs of yore. Of the St. Albans pols, only
Sen. John Warner and Bayh are actually Episcopalians. Kerry is
Roman Catholic. Gore, Ford, and Jackson are Baptists; and Ford and
Jackson are black.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Albans indoctrination creates a very distinctive kind of
politician. St. Albans helps explains why Gore, Bayh, Ford and
Jackson are so unlike their fathers. Their fathers shook up
politics. Gore Sr. was a civil rights maverick. Ford Sr. was one of
the first black politicians of the Deep South. Jackson Sr. is a
champion rabble-rouser.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, by contrast, are superb at fitting in. St. Albans
is a tiny school _ only 70-odd boys per class. It is too small for
cliques. Its size and traditionalism compel conformity. Students
adopt the St. Albans style_ athletic, sarcastic, hardworkingor they
drown. Nonconformists detest the school and usually leave or
suffer. (Gore's mother once called him ``a born conformist.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians lack the overt, grasping ambition that defines
many politicians, including most of their dads. Thanks to the
school's Service First ethos, they consider themselves ``selfless
public servants,'' says Lemann. The St. Albans pols are allergic to
their fathers' populism: After all, they have not spent much time
with the people. Except for Ford, they are not natural
glad-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Their fathers were vigorously liberal. The sons are not
ideological. (Ford and Jackson are probably the least ideological
black politicians in the United States.) St. Albans trained them to
trust cool analysis and the reasonable solution.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise to anyone who went to St. Albans that Gore,
Ford, Bayh and Jackson are relentlessly moderate. The school's old
money, old manners and old traditions breed excellent New
Democrats.

GORE GETS UGLY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It is almost enough to make one have a kind
thought about Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the blue, Al Gore has decided to make a humiliating
example of a woman for the choice she has made of a location for a
fund-raising reception.
</P>
<P>
   This imbroglio involves, curse me for mentioning it in a family
newspaper, the Playboy Mansion. It is also supposed to involve, in
some tortured way that escapes me, sex _ a topic from which
Republicans and Democrats alike recoil with the same horror.
</P>
<P>
   And the allegedly offending person, the Hester Prynne of this
latest tale of morality politics gone nuts, is a congressman
rightly regarded in the Democratic Party as a bit of a hero simply
for the fact that four years ago she dethroned Representative Bob
Dornan of Orange County, who in addition to his other sins had
raised the politics of misogyny to an art.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore invested his time on behalf of Loretta Sanchez when she
ran for reelection against Dornan two years ago, showing up for a
fund-raiser in an apparently politically correct location as well
as two rallies in the county that has been a symbolic capital for
California conservatism but is gradually becoming a symbol of
dynamic diversity. It also turns out that Sanchez is developing
into one fine congressman, increasingly effective on national
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But now, because she had the alleged temerity to arrange a
reception for 650 of her donors at Hugh Hefner's mammary monument
(a smart marketing move and nothing more), consider what is about
to happen to her. At Gore's behest, with the guys who run the
Democratic National Committee and its congressional campaign
affiliate being the agents, she is to be dropped from her
ceremonial honor as a cochairman of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is also to be denied her few moments of face and
speaking time from the podium of this self-sanctified convention.
And now, if cooler heads do not prevail, she is being threatened
with dismissal from her other ceremonial position as a vice
chairman of the party and official disavowal of her reelection
campaign in what is still a potentially competitive district is
even on the table. These latest threats were conveyed last week
directly to Sanchez by no less than Bill Daley, the Gore campaign's
boss, who should know better, being of the Chicago Daleys, in whose
town the Hefner empire was born.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's sins consist of the choice of the mansion in stylish
Holmby Hills for an event, sold out at $5,000 a person, for the
benefit of her political action committee (Hispanic Unity USA) that
registers new Latino voters. It will be held under a tent on the
lawn, not inside the sin palace. There will be no Bunnies around,
as is typical at the many such receptions held there that have
benefited causes from cancer research to arms control. The National
Women's Political Caucus has raised money there, as the Hollywood
Women's Political Committee used to, and as Rock the Vote has on
behalf of young voters. Like, big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Gore reaction of disapproval a few weeks ago was
ridiculous enough, but the move to squish Sanchez like a bug
gathered steam last week in the wake of Gore's bold decision to
make Senator Joe Lieberman his running mate. Gore and Lieberman are
apparently set on being the Cotton and Increase Mather of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The hypocrisy quotient is gigantic. Al Gore has already
collected $1,500 for his own campaign from Hefner and daughter
Christie. Since 1992, the Democratic Party has received at least
$100,000 in Playboy money.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just on the surface. All over town this week,
Democrats are taking money in the homes of people who make dirty
movies, really dirty movies, movies and TV shows that market
violence and sex, toys that glorify gory (pardon the pun) violence,
records that celebrate hatred of women, cop-killing, and rape, not
to mention garden variety polluters, price-gougers, and gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of victim for his symbolism crusade (a slick
marketing effort that in fact destroys the very values it purports
to support) is instructive _ a two-term congressman who is female.
Does anyone think he would land like a ton of bricks on a male
congressman with real seniority?
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has been magnificent in her refusal to get drawn into
this farce. Under absurd pressure, she is willing to find a
different location if she can hold her crowd and its money, which
will go for something worthwhile. All campaigns end up asking
forbearance of their supporters during the inevitable rush to the
center, and sometimes the last straw is itself symbolic, but it is
no less real.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late for an outcry to work. But it wouldn't
surprise me if some serious and high-minded money types in the
Democratic Party started writing checks to Hispanic Unity USA and
telling the big-shot guy Democrats that the dough is coming out of
their hides.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, what Gore was up to was merely dumb. Now,
however things turn out, it's both wrong and revealing.

ELITIST PREP SCHOOL IN D.C. IS GORE'S LITTLE SECRET

</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the Democratic convention will be harangued with
endless hay-strewn yarns about Al Gore's rustic Tennessee
childhood, but they will not hear one word about the place where
Gore spent most of his formative years: St. Albans School.
</P>
<P>
   Gore captained the Bulldogs football team, led the Government
Club, and graduated 25th out of 51 students in the class of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The veep's in good company. The Washington, D.C. prep school has
become the spawning ground for the Democratic Party. Sen. Evan Bayh
of Indiana, who was short-listed for Gore's running mate, is a St.
Albans alumnus. Fellow short-listee Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts attended St. Albans for several years. Rep. Harold
Ford Jr., the convention's keynote speaker and the youngest member
of Congress, was in my class at St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   We were several years behind Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., another
rising young black congressman.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore daughter and adviser Karenna Gore Schiff prepped at the
National Cathedral School, St. Albans' sister institution.
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans embarrasses Gore and his party. Gore never mentions
that he went there. All the St. Albans pols skip the school in
their official biographies. When he was being considered for
running mate, Kerry went so far as calling a reporter (still
another Albanian, Brit Hume) to emphasize that he had left St.
Albans and graduated from a different high school.
</P>
<P>
   The bashfulness is understandable. St. Albans is a snooty,
elitist, inside-the-Beltway institution. The people's party fears
association with an all-boys private school that costs nearly
$20,000 a year, has a ``refectory'' instead of a ``cafeteria,'' and
prides itself on its noblesse oblige. (Gore is, however, inoculated
from St. Albans attacks by the Bush campaign: George W. Bush's
younger brothers Neil and Marvin are graduates.)
</P>
<P>
   How did St. Albans, which is not even one of the nation's most
celebrated private schools, assume such a central role in American
politics?
</P>
<P>
   Prep schools, of course, occupy a hallowed, if horrible, place
in the story of the American establishment. As Nicholas Lemann
chronicles in ``The Big Test: The Secret History of the American
Meritocracy,'' the boarding schools of New England molded the
American Protestant aristocracy from the late-19th century to the
mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The schools enforced muscular Christianity: The football field
was more important than the classroom, and character was,to quote a
favorite St. Albans phrase,''choosing the hard right over the easy
wrong.'' The schools were intended to ``prevent very rich boys from
turning into playboys or pantywaists,'' Lemann writes.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1909, St. Albans served as the D.C. outpost of the
New England prep schools. Under a series of imposing headmasters,
the Episcopal cathedral school earned a reputation for academic and
athletic rigor. The D.C. elite gravitated to it. It was respectable
and Protestant, it won students admission to top colleges, and its
politics were liberal enough not to chagrin Democratic parents: St.
Albans integrated in 1954, early for D.C. private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even after standardized tests broke the prep schools' chokehold
on the establishment in the '60s, St. Albans remained a bastion of
the D.C. aristocracy. Vice Presidents Dan Quayle, Walter Mondale,
and Al Gore deposited their sons at the Lane-Johnston building. So
did dozens of senators, including Ted Kennedy and John D.
Rockefeller IV, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. and Jordan's
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason St. Albans mints politicians is
genetic. The best indicator of a boy's career is his father's. St.
Albans enrolls lots of political sons because of its location and
reputation, and they frequently follow Dad into politics. Most of
the St. Albans grads turned pols _ Gore, Bayh, Ford, and Jackson _
are the oldest sons of politicians. They probably would have run
for office if they had attended PS 152.
</P>
<P>
   But biology is not destiny. St. Albans also steers its boys into
politics. The school acclimates students to Washington. It offers
courses on political theory, American government, American
citizenship, and macroeconomics. Pols are regularly carted in to
speak at assemblies and graduations.
</P>
<P>
   The most prestigious extracurricular activity is the Government
Club, a Thursday night political debate between the ``Liberal'' and
``Conservative'' parties. (Both Gore and Ford served as Liberal
presidents.)
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans still clings to the (now-unfashionable) idea of
noblesse oblige. When boarding schools began losing their
influence, most of them shucked their haute-WASP traditions and
modernized with a vengeance. They adopted coeducation,
multiculturalized their curricula, abandoned dress codes, and
generally distanced themselves from the civic-minded condescension
that had defined them.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Albans hardly wavered from its traditionalism. It is
much more like old boarding schools such as Groton than Groton
itself is. Chapel is still a twice-weekly requirement. The dress
code is rigid. Coeducation is unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools de-emphasized sports, but St. Albans recently
upped its athletic requirement and added such high-suffering,
high-teamwork sports as crew and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The school unashamedly exhorts service as an obligation of
privilege. At every chapel and ceremony, the headmaster drummed
into our swelled heads our duty to help those poor, benighted souls
not fortunate enough to be Albanians. (Students are sardonic about
this, but they don't resist. A recent anti-Gore editorial in the
St. Albans student newspaper commented dryly: ``St. Albans for good
reasons encourages self-confidence [we are going to run the country
in a few years, right?]'')
</P>
<P>
   St. Albans imparts its high Episcopal arrogance to a different
kind of boy from the WASPs of yore. Of the St. Albans pols, only
Sen. John Warner and Bayh are actually Episcopalians. Kerry is
Roman Catholic. Gore, Ford, and Jackson are Baptists; and Ford and
Jackson are black.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Albans indoctrination creates a very distinctive kind of

</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, by contrast, are superb at fitting in. St. Albans
is a tiny school _ only 70-odd boys per class. It is too small for
cliques. Its size and traditionalism compel conformity. Students
adopt the St. Albans style_ athletic, sarcastic, hardworkingor they
drown. Nonconformists detest the school and usually leave or
suffer. (Gore's mother once called him ``a born conformist.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians lack the overt, grasping ambition that defines
many politicians, including most of their dads. Thanks to the

glad-handers.

   Their fathers were vigorously liberal. The sons are not
ideological. (Ford and Jackson are probably the least ideological

`BROCKOVICH' NOT ENOUGH; `SHANE' SHINES ON DVD

   NEW RELEASES: ``Erin Brockovich'' (DVD) _ Julia Roberts is the
box-office queen. Despite a limited range, or maybe because of it,
she's carved a career out of playing sexy mainstream characters.
And though this hit is based on the true story of one woman's fight
against the system, it lacks conviction. It makes you want to run
out and rent Martin Ritt's ``Norma Rae'' with Sally Field, or catch
``Silkwood'' with Meryl Streep. Those were politicized characters
with range and grace and guts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NEW ON DVD: ``Shane'' _ Producer-director George Stevens was
Cecil B. DeMille with heart. The filmmaker who counted ``A Place in
the Sun,'' ``Giant,'' and ``The Greatest Story Ever Told'' among
his epic works made this rather intimate Western in which character
dominates the landscape. Alan Ladd, as the reluctant title
character, is called upon to defend Jean Arthur and Van Heflin's
homestead. One of the first of the so-called ``adult'' Westerns,
``Shane'' is a morally ambiguous story about gunfighting and the
internal consequences endured by the victor. Jack Palance is
terrific as the villain. George Stevens Jr., who was a child at the
time of the production but who spent time with his father on the
set, provides a commentary on the alternate track. The spectacular
Western vistas are enhanced by the crystal-clear reproduction on
DVD.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   OLD ON DVD: ``Jaws'' has more bite than Universal Studios
imagined. The 25-year-old movie beat all the current DVD releases
in the sales department during its first two weeks out. Sales
reached nearly 500,000 over the first 10 days, making an estimated
$25 million for Universal.

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dara Torres would be a great story, but there are
no great stories left in Olympic sports. They all come with
question marks, bigger and uglier than the asterisk that
figuratively sat next to Roger Maris' name in baseball's record
book.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' performances in the pool are swatting down something
bigger than Babe Ruth. She is dismantling assumptions about older
women. At 33, she has swum faster than at 25. She took seven years
off, worked as a television reporter and a model, then came back as
an Olympic contender.
</P>
<P>
   The faster she swims, the hotter the suspicions become. Is
Torres a phenomenon or a fraud? Her sport has been polluted by
performance-enhancing drugs, most of which went undetected for
years, and now every great swimmer sits under a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people have to emphasize drugs because someone does
something really fast?'' Torres asked during a news conference last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Richard Quick of Stanford, has the answer:
``Unfortunately, that's where we are in sports today.''
</P>
<P>
   He defends Torres vigorously. On the pool deck at the Trials, he
invited people to follow her through swimming practices, weight
training, stretching exercises. He suggests reviewing her travel
itinerary, which shows that she scheduled a departure time from
Indianapolis that allows her to work out before she leaves and
again back in San Francisco that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody out there who works harder,'' he said. And then
he stopped himself, grasping the impossibility of fighting
well-founded cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know,'' said Quick, the Olympic coach for American
women. ``That's the same thing they all said.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the East Germans in the 1970s and '80s. He meant the
Chinese in the 1990s. He meant Michelle Smith de Bruin, Ireland's
three-time gold medalist at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   All became swimming superpowers in an instant. All passed
Olympic drug tests. And all have been thoroughly discredited.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, opening up their secret police files from the
Eastern sector after the fall of communism, have admitted to
systematic doping. A raft of positive drug tests, outside the
Olympics, exposed the cheating in China. One swimmer was caught
smuggling a container of human growth hormone into another country
for a competition.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was banned from swimming after tampering with an
out-of-competition drug test, apparently spiking it with whiskey.
Like Torres, Smith would have made a great Olympic story. She was
26; she came from a country with no Olympic-size pools, and she had
never finished higher than 17th at two previous Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans didn't believe her tale. They had been burned
by the East Germans for too long, and they'd learned how to spot
telltale smoke. American coaches and swimmers, joined vociferously
by Canadians and Australians, denounced the success of the Chinese
before any of them had tested positive. In Atlanta, Smith's
accomplishments were roundly dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time for turnabout. A German coach and swimmer
recently speculated that Australia's record-smashing teen-ager, Ian
Thorpe, had taken human growth hormone so that he could end up with
size-17 feet. Inge de Bruijn, a 26-year-old from Holland, destroyed
world records in the 100-meter freestyle and 100 butterfly, and the
Internet lit up with innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicious buzz about Torres' comeback started when she
arrived at the Olympic trials as the new American record holder in
the 50 freestyle. The media, which have spread American allegations
about the Chinese and Smith, had an obligation not to lead
unmitigated cheers for the 33-year-old miracle-in-the-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually surprised it didn't happen earlier, because she's
so completely outside the box,'' Quick said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that rumors have wrapped themselves
around one of his swimmers. Jenny Thompson broke the 100 freestyle
world record in 1992, took it away from a Chinese woman believed to
be doping. By extension, Thompson was a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But those insinuations never went far beyond the swimming world.
The Chinese had not tested positive yet; Smith was an obscure
swimmer at the University of Houston; and the Germans hadn't
started prosecuting former Eastern bloc coaches for forcing
steroids on their athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Torres has inherited the legacy of those scandals. She broke an
American record in the 100 butterfly last week, taking almost 1 1/2
seconds off her previous best time, set just three weeks earlier.
She appeared to be reinventing herself, and in swimming these days,
that's circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing. It doesn't mean that
she's doping, but the ensuing questions are as automatic as
interrogating a husband after his wife is murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said that he believes swimmers can achieve the effects of
doping legally, through special nutrition and scrupulously designed
training. There's no medical evidence to support or contradict him,
but both Torres and Thompson take extensive nutritional
supplements, as many as 25 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The coach believes that better testing is the only way to
protect the sport from both cheaters and unfair innuendo. He is
disgusted that the International Olympic Committee has not found a
way to screen for human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have done it, but they didn't want to spend the
money,'' Quick said. ``I'm very bitter toward the IOC. I think they
care more about sponsorship and television rights than they do
about the athletes.''

LIEBERMAN'S RELIGIOUS FERVOR UNSETTLING TO SOME JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was proud and excited, of course, as Senator Joseph
Lieberman stood on a Nashville podium last week, making his first
official speech as the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate.
But when Lieberman quoted the Scriptures and cited God repeatedly,
Deborah Abner, watching from Brookline, Mass., also confessed to a
nagging unease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in the separation of church and state,''
said Abner, 40, a Jewish mother of four. ``I thought it was a very
powerful speech. But on the other hand, I was a little
uncomfortable. Not because he's Jewish, but because, for me, it
should be separate.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Jewish Americans, that boundary is almost sacred; the
line that divides personal faith from public life has often seemed
not just a question of comfort, but a matter of safety. Separation
of church and state is the reason Jewish people have succeeded in
America, enjoying more freedoms, rights and opportunities than in
nearly any other country, said Rabbi David Saperstein, director of
the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious freedom and separation of church and state,'' he
said, ``are about as close to domestic survival issues for the
Jewish community as you can find.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with apprehension, or at least inner conflict, that
some Jewish Americans are viewing Lieberman _ who has made religion
a major part of his political persona. He observes the strict rules
of Orthodox Judaism, and unabashedly says religious doctrines
affect his ideas and values. He has said that ``we in government
should look to religion as a partner, as I think the founders of
our country did.''
</P>
<P>
   And his first few days on the national ticket involved more open
religious expression than many Christian candidates have shown.
When Vice President Al Gore called to invite Lieberman onto the
Democratic ticket, the first thing the Connecticut senator did was
pray. In his Nashville speech, Lieberman mentioned God at least 13
times. He continued to quote from the Scriptures as the week
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   All of which creates a strange conflict for Abner and Nancy
Friedlander, another Jewish Brookline resident. As they sat in a
coffee shop last week, organizing a parent-teacher group, both said
they are excited about breaking boundaries. But as parents attuned
to religious diversity _ they feel comfortable that their
children's public school has a ``winter festival'' instead of a
Christmas or Hanukkah pageant _ they say they are concerned about
God's encroachment on public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we shouldn't be mixing politics and religion,''
said Friedlander, who said she fears religious doctrine will color
Lieberman's decisions. ``That's what you don't want to see in the
White House. Any fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   That apprehension is likely to be more common among Jews than
non-Jews, said Samuel Freedman, a Columbia University journalism
professor whose recent book, ``Jew vs. Jew,'' explores divisions in
American Jewish culture. As religion becomes an increasing part of
the national conversation, he said, many Christians will admire
Lieberman for his religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the vast number of Reform and Conservative Jews probably
felt a real set of contradictory emotions'' over Lieberman's
speech, Freedman said. ``True, true pride in Lieberman being named,
but also probably a certain amount of discomfort with its overt
religiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, separation-of-church-and-state activists, of all
denominations, are viewing the trend toward religious speech with
wariness. The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State in Washington, said both
parties' nominees have made frequent references to God this year,
something he finds inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to elect the new pastor for the church or
the new rabbi for the synagogue,'' said Lynn, who has been watching
Lieberman's religious references with concern.
</P>
<P>
   And every time candidates talk about their faith, Lynn said, it
prompts more discussion of religion, and takes more of the focus
away from the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But in Saperstein's view, religious talk, in itself, is not the
problem. Instead, he draws a distinction between professing honest
faith and making statements that divide people along religious
lines. Saperstein said he didn't mind when Texas Governor George W.
Bush, asked in a debate to name a public figure he admired,
answered, ``Jesus Christ.'' He was less fond of Bush's response
when asked to elaborate for voters: ``Well, if they don't know,
it's going to be hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Lieberman ``has not crossed that line,'' said
Saperstein, who saw the senator's Nashville speech as an
introduction of his values and beliefs. Over the years, Saperstein
said, he has found that Lieberman ``doesn't talk about his religion
all that much. He lives it, and other people end up talking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lieberman's religious devotion has never been a secret.
He is committed to the tenets of Orthodox Judaism, obeying strict
dietary laws and observing the Sabbath, which forbids most work and
commerce from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. If he has to make
a Senate vote on Saturday _ something Jewish law allows in the
interest of human life or national security _ he walks to the US
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In modern Jewish culture, that in itself is a point of
separation. Only about 7 percent of American Jews practice Orthodox
Judaism; more than 80 percent practice Reform or Conservative
Judaism, which allow far more adaptation to modern circumstances.
And preferring ancient rituals to a secular lifestyle can alienate
some Jews, who have chosen the other path.
</P>
<P>
   Carla, 48, a Reform Jew from Brookline who sat in a bagel shop
and didn't want to give her last name, said she views Orthodox Jews
with a mixture of admiration, wonder, and guilt. She's
uncomfortable with the restrictions Orthodox Judaism places on
women; most Orthodox congregations require men and women to sit
apart during services, and bar women from reading the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you're in the modern era, but you're back in
time . . . you're back to the 1900s,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's unwilling to make those sorts of sacrifices. But
when she sees Orthodox Jews walking to temple on Saturdays, she
said, ``I feel like such a little heathen, going out shopping. I
think, `Oh God, what they must think.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Carla said, she respects Lieberman for adhering to his
faith, despite the pressures of public life. ``I admire that he
kept his religion,'' she said. ``He didn't have to really
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some say Lieberman may represent an ultimate goal of
many American Jews, a sign that achievement is possible without
assimilation. Though Jews have lived in the United States since
pre-Revolutionary times, the first major wave of immigration came
from Eastern Europe between 1885 and 1910, said Barry Shrage,
president of Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston. And for most
of this century, Jews downplayed their differences and tried to
blend into the American melting pot, in part, scholars say, in
reaction to centuries of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1967 _ when Israel proved its strength in the Six-Day
War and multiculturalism took root across America _ more Jews have
been asserting their ethnicity. Shrage said Lieberman represents
the next step; he doesn't just identify himself as Jewish, but has
a deep understanding of Jewish customs and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Freedman said, Lieberman might give Jews a sense of
greater freedom, the idea that they can be as religious as they
want without fear of repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the idea of religious belief _ why should that be
just conceded to the religious right?'' he said. ``That's one of
the great contributions of his candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman's actions may prompt some Reform and Conservative
Jews to delve into long-abandoned rituals, or make Judaism a more
overt part of their lives, said Jonathan Sarna, a professor of
American Jewish history at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents the ultimate synthesis of being Jewish and being
American,'' Sarna said. Jews, he said, have long felt that to
succeed in America, they must ``be a Jew at home, and be a person
outside. Lieberman has said, `No, you actually will succeed quite
well by being an integrated person, the same on the inside and the
outside.' ''

JOB-SEEKING CLINTON AIDES STRIKE OUT ON THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few months after Bill Clinton was inaugurated
president, Kris Engskov, a 21-year-old fresh out of college, put
everything he owned in a car and drove from Arkansas to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had worked on Clinton's 1992 campaign, he never
envisioned working at the White House. But that's where fate would
place him. First he got his foot in the door as a volunteer, and
months later he was getting paid for his work. By the time Engskov
left the White House in June, he had become Clinton's personal aide
_ a man with more proximity to the president than almost anybody
except Clinton's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Engskov typified a group of aides Clinton playfully referred to
as ``the kids who helped me get elected.'' Young and idealistic,
they descended on Washington from across America, awed by the
chance to serve a man who, in some cases, was the first Democratic
president they were old enough to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``kids'' like George Stephanopoulos played more
visible roles in the administration. Many, like Engskov, media
handler Mark Bernstein, and speechwriter Jordan Tamagni worked in
the shadows of the White House _ their reward for either helping
Clinton get elected or reelected.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the last of his two terms is winding down, the kids are
stepping toward the White House exits, and most are not going back
to Topeka or wherever they came from. They are departing for
business school at Columbia and Stanford or careers in cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the more senior members have left for such posts
as senior vice president at Discovery Communications and the
National Basketball Association's entertainment division or jobs at
political consulting firms, many of the younger aides are leaving
for jobs in high-tech and finance _ driven by the desire to replace
the buzz of the White House with the buzz of a new and booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, these folks who've had this presidential experience
are terribly valuable as lobbyists, at trade associations, and law
firms, where they can make use of the experience they've
acquired,'' said presidential historian Stephen Hess, who worked in
the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nixon who brought in the first White House ``baby
corps,'' a group, though smaller than Clinton's, that included
Richard Blumenthal and Christopher DeMuth, both of whom went to
work for Nixon after graduating from Harvard. After he left the
White House, Blumenthal joined the Marines, went to law school, and
today is Connecticut's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   DeMuth went to law school at the University of Chicago and is
now president of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these young people in the Clinton administration to either
go back to school or to something in high-tech and finance, jobs
that would not be in Washington, is something interesting and
different,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Engskov is a bundle of nerves. He has left the White House and
moved from the city of Washington to the state of Washington. He is
about to begin his first day as an analyst at a small venture
capital firm in Seattle. ``I am starting at the bottom again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom was seven years ago, when Engskov and a friend drove from
Arkansas to the nation's capital without money or jobs, and on the
hunt for both. Bottom was being holed up in a $35-a-night motel in
a big, strange city and being ``scared to death.'' But without a
bottom, there's nowhere to rise.
</P>
<P>
   And rise he did, from volunteer staff at the White House to trip
coordinator in the travel office to the president's aide and
assistant press secretary. Engskov's job was to make sure the
president was reading from the right script. In fact, he would walk
up to the dais, glance down at the president's speech and place it
on the lectern before Clinton rose to speak. Tall and rail thin, he
was also responsible for tapping the president on the shoulder to
let him know it was time to go, and for acting as chief gatekeeper
outside the Oval Office. His closeness to Clinton was enough to
trap him into two appearances before the grand jury investigating
the president's relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But, in June, the 28-year-old Berryville, Ark., native said
goodbye to long work days and hello to a U-Haul that he loaded up
and drove for three weeks to Seattle, stopping along the way to
visit friends. It was quite a different journey from the one that
brought him to Washington in May 1993, straight out of the
University of Arkansas with a bachelor's degree in public
administration and finance.
</P>
<P>
   Engskov concedes that the White House was little preparation for
his new job. Having sat ``in the catbird's seat of history all
day,'' he said, it's time to take advantage of the new economy and
``learn a whole new business.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Tamagni, a speechwriter and special assistant to Clinton
before her departure, explained that many of her former colleagues
now leaving the White House ``are looking for a buzz that's strong
_ when every day matters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They went in there to change the world, and if they are going
to leave, they still want to know that they are having an impact,
doing something that is meaningful,'' she explained. ``The place to
do that these days is the high-tech world, because it is actually
changing the way we do things and think about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamagni should know. She left the White House last October to
work for Steve Case, chairman and CEO of America Online. She came
to the White House at age 36 and ``a little bit older than most''
of the people who helped Clinton get elected, but she had the same
idea _ ``to set the world on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamagni has attended law school, taken the bar exam, and passed
it in New York, New Jersey and California. She was a lawyer in
Manhattan when a friend's mother put her in touch with Dick Morris,
a political consultant whom Clinton brought aboard to secretly
advise him after the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing Tamagni knew, she was cutting short a vacation in
New Hampshire and standing in front of the Old Executive Office
Building, a suitcase in one hand and an index card with the address
in the other. A self-described New Democrat, ``I saw this as a real
opportunity to live my values,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She carried Morris's and the other consultants' bags, she
Xeroxed things they needed Xeroxing. ``A lot of people thought I
was a complete idiot for doing it. But I could care less,'' Tamagni
said. ``I thought it's better to be a fly on the wall. I even
thought if I write a book someday, that's the title I'm going to
give it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's reelection in 1996, she was promoted to the
speechwriting department.
</P>
<P>
   When Case began looking for a speechwriter, Tamagni, now 40,
thought there was no way she would reprise that role in the private
sector. But when she learned of Case's interest in education and
closing the digital divide, issues she had worked on in the Clinton
White House and cared deeply about, she jumped at the chance. ``I
wouldn't have come here if I hadn't an opportunity to contribute to
the greater good,'' she said from her office at America Online in
Virginia. ``It's been a pretty good tradeoff.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tradeoffs are what it's all about at the White House, namely
trading compensation for an experience money can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a joint master's degree in business administration
and law and passing the Michigan bar, Mark Bernstein probably could
have made a lot of money. But he didn't. Instead, he got bitten by
the Clinton bug.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the White House Travel Office, he became
director of press pool operations, a job coordinating the movement
of reporters who cover Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most incredible thing is when we would come back from a
foreign trip. Here I was flying on Air Force One, touching down at
Andrews Air Force Base, and then riding in a staff van into the
White House and having the gates swing open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be 10:30 or 12:30 at night, and I would get out of
the van, walk to the bus stop, and take the S-4 bus home. I always
thought, as long as you kept doing that, you were always grounded.
The people on the bus, they didn't know where you were coming
from,'' Bernstein said. ``There was something beautiful about that.
I always loved doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, 28, is starting work this month on Wall Street at the
investment firm of Solomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the past, people were getting to the White House when
they were older and after longer careers,'' Bernstein said. ``For
them, it was like the pinnacle of their career. For us, it's a
piece of the puzzle. I certainly see this as just the beginning.''

 WOMEN'S RIGHTS, MEN WRONG?  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Just the whiff of accusation was enough to chill the campus
climate last winter for Ryan Girard and Chris Bombardier and other
University of Massachusetts students whose only sins were their
average height, their baseball caps _ and their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Four rapes had allegedly taken place near the Campus Pond, and
all that students had to go on was a composite sketch that looked
like half the men on campus. Male students began feeling studied
over, as if they were being compared to the description.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough being a guy around here,'' said Girard, a junior
with thick sideburns and a slight goatee. ``You get dirty looks
from girls all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   For students such as Girard, a new survey by a leading magazine
confirmed what he sometimes suspected: UMass Amherst is one of the
10 worst campuses in the nation for male students, according to
Men's Health.
</P>
<P>
   Three other New England schools _ Brown University, Dartmouth
College, and Bates College _ also made the list, based on a survey
of students and professors about campuses that were unwelcoming to
men.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings' thesis _ that the 10 were havens of political
correctness, where men were regarded as drunken, horny predators _
dismayed many college officials. ``We're not an unfriendly school
to anyone,'' said Javier Cevallos, UMass's interim vice chancellor
for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that some so-called ``anti-male'' policies that
Men's Health complains about are really just efforts to level the
playing field in institutions that, only a few decades ago, were
still all-male or had special curfews and rules for women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some male students and experts on campus life say higher
education _ while not overtly anti-male _ has become less welcoming
to men.
</P>
<P>
   They say the strength of the women's movement at Northeast
colleges, and the fact that women outnumber men enrolling and
graduating today, have led to a new kind of special treatment for
women _ such as harassment codes and orientation programs that,
some men say, cast them as potential predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If campuses believed in truth in advertising, this is what
their catalogs would start off with: `We believe your sons are the
sexist, privileged beneficiaries of a system of patriarchy, and for
massive taxpayer subsidies or $30,000 a year, we'll assign them
unequal rights,' '' said Alan Charles Kors, a professor of history
at the University of Pennsylvania and coauthor of ``The Shadow
University,'' a polemic against political correctness on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kors said male students have become targets particularly of
student-life codes in higher education. Most famously, a male
freshman at Penn was charged in 1993 with violating a speech policy
when he called five black women ``water buffalo'' for making noise
outside his dorm. The student said he had not meant to malign the
women, and the complaint against him was eventually dropped. Penn
also settled a lawsuit by the accused, and changed the code.
</P>
<P>
   At Antioch College, an institution in Ohio that also made the
magazine's worst-school list, a policy warns that when students
become intimate, they risk being punished unless they follow a
detailed playbook for rounding the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verbal consent should be obtained with each new level of
physical and/or sexual behavior in any given interaction,
regardless of who initiates it,'' the code states. ``Asking `Do you
want to have sex with me?' is not enough. The request for consent
must be specific to each act.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass does not have such a policy, but some critics of speech
codes say the university's policy governing verbal harassment does
infringe on students' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of men are afraid to speak up because they get labeled
sexist,'' said Daphne Patai, a professor of Brazilian literature at
UMass Amherst, who has written about gender issues on campus.
``That a climate of suspicion about words and gestures has been
created by the concept of sexual harassment seems clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But are such policies anti-male? Arlene Avakian, an associate
professor of women's studies at UMass, said clashes on many
Northeast campuses between women's activists on the one side, and
conservative students and professors on the other, may give some
men the ``myopic'' view that they are treated badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think it's a good campus for men because they could
learn more about women's issues so they could work to create a more
humane world,'' Avakian said. ``If this is a bad place for men
because women are getting supported, it's a much worse place for
women who are being assaulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Several male UMass students said last week they were disgusted
by the attacks last winter. At the same time, they felt unfairly
under suspicion, and placed part of the blame for that on the
campus environment for men.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier, a senior at UMass, recalled his freshmen
orientation, when new female students were warned that rape and
harassment were problems on campus. Bombardier said the message was
that women should be on guard constantly, which he felt was unfair
to the men in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking on eggshells at this school,'' he said.
``You're not sure if people are looking at you like a rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Tiger, a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University,
said he believes male students do not feel comfortable pressing
their needs now that campuses have becoming increasingly dominated
by female students. About 8 million women attend college, compared
to about 6.3 million men, according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has stood up for them, in a sense,'' said Tiger, author
of ``The Decline of Males,'' a 1999 book about the role of men in
families. ``For a lot of males, they feel kind of left out of the
larger dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   But many male students at Dartmouth College certainly spoke up
last year when officials proposed opening Greek houses to both men
and women. Dartmouth, which is widely regarded as a comfortable
school for men, watered down that plan, but was still spanked by
Men's Health for broaching the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the job of all of us to make students, faculty, and
everyone feel welcome,'' said Laurel Stavis, a Dartmouth
spokeswoman. ``These are not easy things to accomplish, but they're
crucial things to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for women, however, add to the perception of some
students that colleges set a double-standard for men.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wortman, a UMass junior studying computer science, said he
and some friends were bewildered when a computer lab posted a job
ad that specifically sought female workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little unsure if that was legal,'' he said, with a
note of derision in his voice. A male friend of his ended up
getting the job.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Fix, a senior majoring in speech pathology, and her
boyfriend, Jason Eiseman, a 1998 graduate, said they thought the
anti-male label for UMass was unfair. But the university's efforts
to clamp down on its ``ZooMass'' party reputation has curbed
staples of campus life that many men enjoy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a pink blanket near the pond here, in between bites
of his picnic lunch, Eiseman described how men flocked to his
dormitory freshmen year to play drinking games. One concoction of
choice, he said, was a shot of Sambuca with a live goldfish slipped
in.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, UMass officials have shut down a couple of
fraternities for alcohol violations and enforced a zero-tolerance
policy for underage drinking. Last year, disciplinary action
involving drinking cases fell 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a huge party and fraternity scene,'' Eiseman
said. ``The tide definitely turned.''

AN (IVY) LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's ability, not pedigree, that matters. Or so we're told.
</P>
<P>
   Believe that? Consider this.
</P>
<P>
   Come fall of 2001, when ``The Game'' _ the yearly gridiron clash
between Harvard and Yale _ rolls around, both the Democratic and
Republican tickets could be there in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four candidates, three are Yalies, one a Harvard man.
Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate, has two degrees from
Yale, George W. one from each school. Dick Cheney, Bush's second
banana, did two years, on and off, at Yale before finishing at the
University of Wyoming. Gore went to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two major parties are competing to see who can pay greater
homage to American diversity, and their own version of diversity is
three guys from Yale and a guy from Harvard,'' jokes Ralph
Whitehead, professor of journalism at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so exclusive is this particular election that even the
third-party candidates have Ivy League diplomas. Green Party
champion Ralph Nader got his undergraduate degree at Princeton
before earning a law degree at Harvard. Pat Buchanan, who passes as
the scrappy mutt in an Ivy League litter, went to Georgetown
undergrad, before getting a master's at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Ivy League's lock on the 2000 presidential
campaign even more remarkable is that it comes when the elite
schools are supposedly less revered in everyday American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The influence of the Ivy League was much stronger 40 years ago
than it is now,'' says Ted Morgan, biographer of Franklin
Roosevelt. ``At that time they had a monopoly on America's elite.
Now there are other schools that are just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason Boston University chancellor John Silber,
who earned his MA and PhD at Yale, sees no significance to the
Yale-Harvard face-off. ``It is just a fluke,'' says Silber. ``Those
things happen. You go to a casino and every now and then, three
cherries line up or three oranges or three lemons.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so _ and yet, be they cherries or lemons, the Ivy Leaguers
seem to be lining up and squaring off an awful lot in the last few
elections. In New Haven, Director of Public Affairs Larry Haas
boasts that the presence of a Yale graduate on both the Democratic
and GOP tickets means a son of Eli will have been on every
successful national ticket from 1980 to 2000. Of the 28 major-party
national ticket slots since 1976, Yale claims nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it is fate, but I do believe it is more than
coincidence,'' says Richard Brodhead, dean of Yale College, who
says the Yalies on the national tickets are only the most visible
manifestation of a public-service mission that sees Yale graduates
serving in all levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, if graduate degrees are counted, Harvard still leads,
with six presidents to Yale's four. Interestingly, though, while
Harvard hasn't had an alum in the Oval Office since John Kennedy
(1961-63), Yale has had three since 1974: Ford, Bush, and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Counting this year, three of the most recent four elections,
meanwhile, have had a distinct Yale-Harvard cast. In 1988, George
H.W. Bush was, of course, a Yalie, while Michael Dukakis, who
earned his undergraduate degree from Swarthmore, had a Harvard law
degree. (Who can forget Bush's poisonous Ivy League insult that
Dukakis got his foreign-policy views from a ``Harvard boutique''?)
Ditto 1992, given Bill Clinton's time at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the first year in modern memory where Yale and
Harvard have so clearly dominated the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Why? One reason seems to be the presidential recruitment
pipeline. In the modern era, chief executives come from three
places: the vice-presidency, a governorship, or the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League and other elite schools are disproportionately
represented there.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 151 possible candidates _ two senators, one governor, per
state, plus the VP _ 41 have a degree of some sort from one of six
colleges: Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Columbia, Princeton, or
Dartmouth. (If, like Bush, an officeholder has a degree from each,
he's credited to the school that awarded the BA.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus, all other things being equal, there's a 27 percent chance
that a given candidate for president hails for an elite university.
(By that reckoning, Harvard currently counts 16
presidential-eligible officeholders, Yale 10.)
</P>
<P>
   But all other things are hardly equal; there also appears to be
a significant amount of self-selection at play in the field of the
political lords. This year, for example, both Democratic candidates
and three of the five plausible Republicans hopefuls had elite Ivy
League degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to a variant of the age-old chicken-and-egg question
of causation: Is an elite university education something that
shapes a candidate for high office? Or is it family background that
pushes a person both to a Harvard or a Yale and then along a
high-profile political path?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ability is important, and the best of Harvard and Yale
students can make a legitimate claim to be the nation's best and
the brightest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They happen to be very good schools, which says something
about the caliber of candidates who are running,'' says Dukakis,
who modestly counts himself a Swarthmorean.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, objects social critic Camille Paglia. Paglia, who
earned a doctorate at Yale, contends that the real power of a
Harvard or Yale degree is less in what, than whom, one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yale or Harvard connection has nothing to do with superior
education or superior people; it has to do with a web of
friendships and affiliations built up in school,'' she says. ``We
have gone back to the era of the aristocratic court.''
</P>
<P>
   Paglia's critique wins basic agreement from Garrison Nelson, a
professor of political science at the University of Vermont who has
studied leadership recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't come to these schools to be educated, they come
to be credentialed and to network,'' Nelson says. ``These are the
most ambitious young men in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping statements, those. Yet apply them to this year's
election: Watching a pedestrian campaign, or viewing academic
records that run from mediocre to middling, it's hard to spot real
intellectual sparkle in either Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's no denying that both were sons of
privilege who attended prestigious prep schools and benefited from
politically connected fathers. Which makes it hard not to conclude
that their Ivy League diplomas may be better barometers of family
background than intellectual distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps there's something more at work here.
</P>
<P>
   If Harvard and Yale attract students who not only hope someday
to be a governor or senator or even president, but who consider it
altogether possible, voters also look at them in a special way. In
an age that stresses education, a degree from a top-flight school
is a mark of validation as ``a certified achiever, part of what you
might call the status reference groups,'' says Tobe Berkovitz,
professor of communication at BU.
</P>
<P>
   ``These schools basically give you cachet,'' concurs Nelson.
``This is a brand name. It is shorthand for competence.''
</P>
<P>
   The media seems just as fascinated by pedigree, so much so that
entire chapters in the newspaper biographies of Bush and Gore have
been devoted to the candidates' college careers in Cambridge or New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think that if Gore or Bush had gone to, say, the
University of Tennessee or Texas A&AMP;M, quite so much ink would have
been spilled chronicling their college years. What, after all, do
we know of Reagan at Eureka College? Can anyone remember where Bob
Dole went to college?
</P>
<P>
   If Harvard and Yale weigh heavily in the public mind, they
figure just as importantly in shaping identity and validating
ambition. If caricature of a Harvard grad always eager to sprinkle
that fact into conversation is in some part a stereotype born of
Ivy envy, it's still fair to say that self-confidence is in
sufficient enough supply in Cambridge and New Haven that neither
college has ever had to resort to rationing.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly the Harvard or Yale experience plays a stronger
part in a graduate's everyday sense of himself than do most other
colleges. Here, for example, is how Harvard graduate _ and former
governor _ William F. Weld answered a recent question about why he
prefers the shorter reviews of the New York Times Book Review to
the longer essays in the New York Review of Books: ``I enjoyed
being a member of the Fly Club more than a member of the Signet
Society at Harvard.'' Signet, Weld hastened to explain, is a
literary society, while the Fly Club is basically a social
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what other college's graduates assume that others know,
or are interested in, the difference between their college's clubs,
societies, or, even, residence halls? Or that their college days
are relevant reference point decades later?
</P>
<P>
   In other times and places, a privileged background might play as
a distinct disadvantage. Certainly it did for Bush in his
unsuccessful 1978 race for Congress, when opponent Kent Hance
mocked him as a son of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But prosperity has muted American suspicion of privilege and
made elites more broadly trusted and acceptable, contends Jeffrey
Bell, author of ``Populism and Elitism,'' and a veteran of Ronald
Reagan's presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare this year to 1992, when a sitting president gets 37
percent of the vote and Ross Perot gets 19 percent even though he
is talking about Martians invading his daughter's wedding,'' says
Bell. ``But now, (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan is one
of the most admired figures in American life. It is just a very
unusual mindset on the part of the American voter to have that much
of a trust in the people who are on top.''
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, you'd trust Ivy too. Wouldn't you?

FALSE CREDENTIALS WORRY HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Roark performed surgery on hundreds of patients in Ohio,
Michigan, and Canada before supervisors learned his medical degree
was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen applicants for a gastroenterology fellowship at the
University of Pittsburgh falsely claimed they had published
research papers.
</P>
<P>
   The chief financial officer of UMass Memorial Health Care was
demoted to vice president last month when his bachelor's and
master's degrees were exposed as fictional.
</P>
<P>
   Falsified credentials have become a nagging problem for the
health care industry, helping to spur a whole new cadre of
background-checking firms in recent years to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Although executive search firms say resume fibs are at epidemic
levels across professions, the problem is particularly worrisome in
the health care industry, where lapses in integrity can not only
embarrass a company but also endanger a patient. Roark, for
example, has been sued by a man who says his botched surgery left
him with no feeling in one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UMass Memorial's willingness to keep Michael Greene on as
vice president has some critics calling for more serious attention
to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, two areas in which we are national leaders,
education and medicine, are also two areas where qualifications and
personal integrity are paramount,'' said Nancy Achin Sullivan,
executive director of the state Board of Registration in Medicine.
``I think we should expect better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Greene never pretended to be a doctor _ a more severe
offense in most people's books _ some feel UMass Memorial set a bad
example by deciding to demote him, not fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am stunned. It is incomprehensible to me,'' said Peter
George, a headhunter for Management Recruiters International who
said he has located 12 new hires for Massachusetts General Hospital
in the past year. ``They should demote him to unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   But UMass Memorial trustees and executives have essentially
pleaded ``no harm, no foul.'' Although Greene's falsified resume is
regrettable, they say, he has been good for the institution. Greene
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant outsider who lacks the right pedigree but bluffs a
way into success is almost as much an American icon as the Horatio
Alger hero who rises from humble origins by following the rules.
Resume-bluffing is often viewed as a victimless crime, something
``everybody does,'' job recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, claiming false credentials or omitting negatives from a
resume can have real, harmful consequences, say physicians,
headhunters, and educators. The harm, they say, ranges from the
physical, such as subjecting patients to treatment by phony
doctors, to the intangible, such as devaluing the sacrifices of
people who honestly earn degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the Massachusetts medical board disciplined 17
doctors between 1995 and 1999 for embellishing credentials _
nothing nearly as extreme as faking a medical degree _ or failing
to disclose disciplinary actions or malpractice lawsuits against
them. The doctors were fined between $2,500 and $5,000 as part of
the board's mission of ``protecting the public,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with non-physician employees, teaching hospitals, including
UMass Memorial, which is affiliated with the University of
Massachusetts Medical School, have a special responsibility to
uphold academic integrity, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Witt/Kieffer, a national executive search firm that specializes
in health care and has Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston among
its clients, automatically rejects candidates, physicians or not,
who are found to have falsified a resume, spokeswoman Susan Nalepa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Health systems have a ``sacred trust'' to provide care, she
said, and the leader of the system must be ``regarded as having
very high personal integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiter and vice president Emanuel D. Berger said applicants
should be straightforward: ``Most executive search consultants are
willing to look at an unusual candidate, perhaps without a degree,
if they have other qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene built his 20-year career partly on claims he had a
bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts and a
master's of business administration from Northeastern University,
schools he attended but from which he did not graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The fiction helped get him a two-year stint as top administrator
at Cambridge City Hospital in the 1980s and a succession of jobs at
University of Massachusetts Medical Center, which he helped
shepherd through a merger with private Memorial Health Care.
Questioned by his bosses last month after the Worcester Telegram &AMP;
Gazette raised questions, Greene offered his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of accepting it, chief executive officer Dr. Arthur
Russo said Greene was a brilliant administrator who had made a
youthful mistake, and demoted him to vice president.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien, who worked under Greene at the Cambridge, Mass.
hospital and is now its CEO, declined to pass judgment on the UMass
decision. ``Every (health care) system has to make a decision like
that on their own,'' he said, adding that Greene was a
``hard-driving, results-oriented'' administrator.
</P>
<P>
   That is beside the point, said Barmak Nessirian, an analyst with
the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions
Officers, which represents 9,300 higher education administrators in
the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the sympathy in the world with people who feel that
their performance in itself explains their qualificaton,'' he said.
``It may be that there are plenty of positions that currently
require a degree that should not. But the college degree represents
a significant commitment of resources in terms of cost and in terms
of academic effort. People shouldn't simply decide that . . . they
can essentially award it to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Harvard Medical School fired a middle manager
who was found to have exaggerated educational credentials and prior
work experience, said Don Gibbons, director of communications. He
said the school checks references but does not routinely verify the
college degrees of applicants for non-medical positions.
</P>
<P>
   The physician who finally caught Roark _ by carrying out a
routine check with an American Medical Association database when he
applied for a job _ said most physicians would be perturbed if they
had to work under a hospital executive with a faked record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to think you've affiliated yourself with an
organization that's not as assiduous as they might be in checking
one's credentials or qualifications,'' said Dr. Linda Nash, chief
of medicine at Ingham Regional Medical Center in Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience with Roark has prompted her to lobby for tighter
credential-checking requirements for hospitals. She is not alone:
James B. Stewart's 1999 book ``Blind Eye'' criticized doctors for
failing to police their own in the case of Michael Swango, the
physician accused of killing patients in a series of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Roark practiced medicine for 10 years, although he never
attended medical school and was dropped from two residency programs
for inadequate performance. In 1998, he was sentenced to six to 14
years in prison by a judge who compared his conduct to sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Even criminal background checks have their limitations. Henry M.
Jiminian, a 33-year-old clerical worker at Massachusetts General
Hospital, was arraigned last week on charges of killing a man in
New York eight years ago. The charges hadn't been filed in 1995,
when he was hired, and the hospital's routine criminal background
check wouldn't have caught an out-of-state offense.
</P>
<P>
   Companies afraid they could be sued for hiring people with false
credentials have fueled the growth of an entire industry of
credential-checking firms, Nessirian said. Thousands of falsifiers
are caught each month through calls to registrars' offices,
according to a five-year-old study.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Connors, of Risk Management Advisors in Stoneham, Mass.,
said his firm does about 4,500 credential checks a year, half in
the health care industry, and finds significant misinformation in
about one-fourth of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   If an applicant lies about credentials, he said, ``how can you
believe them when they come to you with information that's critical
to the health of the company?''
</P>
<P>
   Credential-checking firms have plenty of stories to tell about
bogus health care applicants.
</P>
<P>
   According to Paul Byron, senior vice president of LCF Associates
in Braintree, Mass., which charges $500 to $5,000 per search, one
applicant for a senior position claimed he had been blinded in a
boating accident for 12 years and regained his sight through
surgery. In fact, Byron said, he'd been in jail.

&HT;     NEW YORK'S TRANSFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back in the early 1970s when I was living in New
York City, there was a standing joke that pretty much summed up the
attitude of the typical Manhattanite and the atmosphere that
attitude created:
</P>
<P>
   Late in her first day in the Big Apple, a weary tourist walks up
to a New Yorker on a street corner and says: ``Could you please
tell me how to get to the Empire State Building _ or should I just
go bleep myself?''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   And they have changed so much for the better, I believe that the
inhabitants of my fabled little West Coast paradise _ San Francisco
_ could take some lessons in civility from New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed the beginning of the transformation in the early-'90s
when I was in New York on business. Friends had told me it was a
kinder, gentler town than the one I'd called home and visited
through the '80s. Friends were right.
</P>
<P>
   The streets were cleaner, there was less gratuitous horn
blowing, and the mass transit system, perhaps the most revealing
arena for a city's values and manners, was a relatively benign
experience. Even the subway.
</P>
<P>
   As I discovered last week, the situation has only improved.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is not just a friendlier and more gracious place than
it used to be, it's friendlier and more gracious than - I never
thought I'd say this - San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Because I saw the change coming before he took office, I don't
credit Generalissimo Rudy Giuliani for New York's metamorphosis.
Yes, the current mayor has rid the streets of squeegee-wielding
mendicants and attempted to outlaw being poor.
</P>
<P>
   But scruffy men still push contraband shopping carts along the
sidewalks; women wearing five layers of clothing still stretch out
on the grass of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cosmetics or ``quality of life'' legislation, the
new New York seems to me most about attitude. And I suspect that
the turn-around is the result of New York's citizens reaching a
kind of change-or-die fork in the road.
</P>
<P>
   When I left Manhattan in 1975, the city was on the verge of
economic bankruptcy and all the municipal woes that sorry state
implies. People who had for years relished the Stein cartoon
perspective of New York _ all-important Manhattan in minute detail,
the rest of the United States represented by a few fuzzy landmarks
_ found themselves living in a seething, hostile, loser of a town.
</P>
<P>
   Humbled and threatened from within, they chose _ individually
and municipally _ to stop blaming each other, the latest wave of
immigrants or all elected officials. They took stock of their
community. They began to acknowledge a common thread of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike contemporary San Franciscans, Manhattanites today no
longer seem to have a collective chip on their shoulder. Nobody
owes them; they wear no mantle of entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere on the streets, in restaurants, in parks and on
buses is one of shared community. Whether they are conscious of it
or not, a great many New Yorkers appear to subscribe to a karmic
theory of existence:
</P>
<P>
   Dump some bad energy on a stranger and, be assured, it will come
back to you and the folks around you, probably three-fold.
Conversely, if you deliberately short-circuit a big dump of anger,
selfishness or stupidity - work to neutralize it, not nurture it -
you and the entire community benefit.
</P>
<P>
   I saw this approach manifest itself all over Manhattan in the
long weekend I was there.
</P>
<P>
   On crowded, behind-schedule buses, people still maintained a
kind of benevolent awareness of others. The younger and more
able-bodied noticed the older and more frail, and they gave them
their seats or an easier hand-hold on poles and railings.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of departing passengers, I swear to God, said,
``Thank you'' or ``Bye'' to the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In three days, walking from the lower East Side to the Upper
West, through Hell's Kitchen, Central Park and my old neighborhood
in Chelsea in the West 20s, I heard more Excuse-me's and
I'm-sorry's than I have heard in San Francisco in the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Am I saying Manhattan has turned into some kind of Zen retreat
center?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. It's still noisy, bustling and as dirty as a small
island of 3-plus million people can't help but be. Lots of taxi and
truck drivers still negotiate the streets as if they were a Formula
One race course or use their horns like turn signals.
</P>
<P>
   But an awful lot of folks seem quick to smile back, hold open a
door, stand patiently in line for a cab at Penn Station or a hot
dog and kraut in United Nations Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   And while I didn't actually attempt it, my guess is, if you go
up to a New Yorker these days and ask how to get to the Empire
State Building, nine times out of 10, you'll get directions.

WHY LIEBERMAN, NOT KERRY, WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps some conservative writers and talk show hosts were
sincere when they said that if Al Gore picked US Senator John F.
Kerry as his running mate, that would be bad news for the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps they weren't. Perhaps they were engaging in a bit of
Br'er Rabbit strategy. In the Walt Disney classic ``Song of the
South,'' Br'er Rabbit, desperate to disappear into the briar patch,
pleaded with the fox not to throw him in it _ knowing full well the
contrary fox would ignore his pleas. After landing in the patch,
the laughing rabbit waved to the fox and thanked him.
</P>
<P>
   But if the conservatives were employing the Br'er Rabbit
strategy, Gore did not fall for it. He passed up Kerry for Senator
Joseph Lieberman, who appears to be an even stronger choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who will be the first Jewish vice presidential
candidate for a major party in American history, has already done
for Gore what Kerry could not do as a running mate. Because
Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to denounce President
Clinton's behavior with Monica Lewinsky as ``immoral,'' his
presence on the ticket should help to separate Gore from the
Clinton scandal. Thus, the GOP is denied the weapon it has been
trying to use against Gore from the start of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lieberman, as chair of the centrist-oriented
Democratic Leadership Council that both Clinton and Gore support,
brings a moderate to conservative tone to the ticket that may
attract swing voters who may have been leaning to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Bush campaign has issued no negative comments about
Lieberman, largely because there's very little for them to be
negative about. The only thing the Republicans have said publicly
thus far is that Lieberman's voting record is more like Bush's than
Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Lieberman's record is far closer to Gore's,
particularly on labor issues such as the Democrats' proposed
increase in the minimum wage and other such measures supported by
organized labor and most Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As a more centrist candidate than even Gore or Clinton,
Lieberman is also expected by some political analysts to help Gore
win a number of states, from Pennsylvania through the Midwest, that
were leaning toward Bush a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gore picked Lieberman, there were serious concerns among
Democrats that Gore could lose New York and Hillary Clinton would
lose her Senate bid there to challenger Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish population in New York has thus far been viewed as
lukewarm to Gore and the first lady. But with Lieberman on the
ticket, Democrats have sensed a new energy and optimism about the
New York vote.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a feeling among African-American political
activists that having Lieberman on the ticket will bring more black
voters to the polls, because Gore has reached out to someone whose
background is uncommon in presidential politics. More than a few
will view this as progress toward one day having an
African-American on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats worry that Lieberman _ who helped blacks register
to vote in the 1960s, during the civil rights movement _ will be
more of a liability than an asset in Gore's efforts to win some
Southern states. They suggest that in the Bible-Belt Baptist
states, there will be no strong support for a Democratic ticket
that includes an Orthodox Jew, even if the presidential candidate
is from the South. But recent events suggest that the
Gore-Lieberman ticket has a chance of winning at least one or two
Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman said at a rally in Atlanta that they will
make a strong effort in the region. Backing up that statement were
several Democratic governors from the South who appeared on
stage.They included Roy Barnes of Georgia, Jim Hunt of North
Carolina, Don Siegelman of Alabama, and Paul Patton of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats privately expressed concern that there would be a
voter backlash against Gore for having a Jew on the ticket. But
most political analysts see Lieberman as much more of a plus than a
minus. As some analysts point out, some of the people who say they
will vote against Gore because of Lieberman would vote against Gore
if Lieberman were not on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters will see Gore's selection of Lieberman as evidence
that he's willing to make a bold choice. And that bold choice is
shaping up to be a wise one. Not only has Gore's choice helped him
to grow as a candidate, it has also helped America to grow in the
eyes of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why picking Lieberman in August has increased rather
than diminished Gore's chances of winning the White House in
November.

FLYING CLOUD 
The True Story of America's Most Famous Clipper Ship and the Woman
who Guided Her 
By David W. Shaw 
Morrow, 290 pp., illustrated, $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On August 31, 1851, the clipper ship Flying Cloud sailed into
San Francisco Bay on her maiden voyage, a record-setting 89 days,
21 hours out of New York _ and just 137 days after the craft had
been launched at Donald McKay's shipyard in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The record _ a valuable commodity in those California Gold Rush
years _ stood only until Flying Cloud broke it herself (by 13
hours) three years later. But this second performance remained
unmatched for over a century, into the era of modern,
high-performance maxi-yachts.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just state-of-the art design and skillful
ship-handling that made the initial record-setting voyage possible.
It was also tradition-breaking navigation by Flying Cloud's
navigator: a woman, Eleanor ``Ellen'' Creesy, the wife of skipper
Josiah Perkins Creesy. The whole story _ McKay's design, Perkins
Creesy's ship-handling, and especially Ellen Creesy's navigation,
not to mention the perils of a stormy winter passage around the
bottom of South America _ make for a splendidly rousing sea story.
</P>
<P>
   It is recounted in ``Bristol fashion'' by a veteran yachting
writer, David W. Shaw. His account is backed up by well-executed
charts of the voyage that focus on the navigational problems
mastered by Ellen Creesy.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing upon letters and journals of the Creesys, and of
Flying Cloud's passengers, Shaw has fashioned a fully realized
person in Ellen Creesy. Only an occasional bit of imagined
conversation between the Creesys stretches the limits, but not
dangerously so.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Creesy, 36 at the time of the Flying Cloud voyage, came
from Marblehead, as did her husband. She learned pilotage and
navigation from her father, John Prentiss, the captain of a coastal
schooner _ causing, Shaw writes, ``something of a stir.'' But she
was ``the boy he never had, and as a forward-thinking man he saw no
crime in educating his daughter in the ways of the sea.'' The
mathematics of celestial navigation _ plotting a ship's position by
calculations based on successive sightings of the sun and stars _
challenged her, ``and ultimately allowed her to experience a level
of freedom and responsibility rare for a woman of her day.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond mastering the mysteries of celestial navigation, what
gave Ellen Creesy the edge over most other navigators of her day _
and enabled her to plot the record-setting course _ was her firm
belief in the ``Wind and Current Charts'' recently published by
Matthew Fontaine Maury, then a young Navy lieutenant and
superintendent of the Naval Observatory in Washington (a post he
would resign to join the Confederate Navy at the outbreak of the
Civil War).
</P>
<P>
   Maury's charts, Shaw writes, were the first to apply
meteorologic and oceanographic knowledge ``to the day-to-day press
of business.'' Maury realized that if captains ``knew where and
when to expect fair winds or foul, and favorable or adverse
currents, they could determine the best routes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ship captains, Shaw writes, ``scoffed at Maury's work and
dismissed it out of hand because it often went against the
prevailing wisdom of navigation during that time.'' Shaw suggests
that it frequently took an act of faith on Perkins Creesy's part to
follow the Maury-suggested course set by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Creesys had sailed together as master and navigator for 10
years, and had just returned from a successful China tea voyage,
when their great opportunity came with Flying Cloud. But it was a
maiden voyage for a ship which, Shaw writes, ``stretched the
limits'' of ship-design. Barely a week out of New York, sailing in
a gusty but not over-powering wind, the rigging high aloft failed
and the main and mizzen topmasts crashed to the deck, carrying with
them roughly half the ship's sails _ revealing, Shaw writes, ``the
fragile nature of the ship'' which every ``sailor faces time and
agin and lives with for the duration of a passage.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the feel of a sailor in Shaw's account of the Flying
Cloud under storm conditions in the South Atlantic _ not a
``perfect storm,'' just what is expected in those regions. Then an
easterly gale off Cape Horn tests the skipper and the navigator
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Fame, bonuses and future good commands await the Creesys when
they bring Flying Cloud into San Francisco. And had Flying Cloud
survived to sail into Boston Harbor this summer, she would have
been the undisputed queen of the Tall Ships fleet. That, of course,
was not to be. After a few more voyages, her masts were shortened
for service in the coastal trade. Then, in June, 1874, she went
aground in St. John, New Brunswick, during a summer storm. A year
later, she was ordered burned in order to salvage her copper
bottom.

&HT;     ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR BIG TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT JAMES PARSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In its continuing war against Big Tobacco, the
World Health Organization has just fired another round. Although
the war is far from over, the WHO's recent report about how Big
Tobacco has tried to subvert it will lower yet further the tobacco
industry in the eyes of the general public.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a blue-ribbon investigating committee led by
Swiss Surgeon General Dr. Thomas Zeltner, ``Tobacco Company
Strategies to Undermine Tobacco Control Activities at the World
Health Organization'' makes interesting reading, but in view of
what came out of the Minnesota trials in 1998, much of it is
predictable _ with one chilling exception.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter Eight, in what first appears to be a strange digression,
deals with standard-setting for pesticides. In fact, the pesticides
in question, grouped together under the acronym EBDC, have been a
lifeline for the tobacco industry for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Their classification as safe by the WHO has had widespread
ramifications throughout the world, most likely negative on all
counts - except the tobacco companies' balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes were summed up in a 1992 memorandum by scientist
Helmut Rief, in the employ of Philip Morris, writing for the
company executives: ``(1) Fungal diseases are among the most severe
problems for tobacco and other crops around the world; (2) the most
menacing disease _ blue mold _ can only be controlled by a constant
application of fungicides; (3) EBDCs are the most widely used
fungicides which do not create resistant fungus strains.''
</P>
<P>
   Rief then points out that the classification decision of WHO's
Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues would be critical to the future
of these chemicals, and, by extension, to the financial health of
the tobacco industry. (The joint meeting is sponsored by the WHO
and the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization and deals with
safety levels of pesticides.)
</P>
<P>
   The warning bells had started ringing in 1989, when the
Environmental Protection Agency called into question the whole
family of EBDCs by concluding that the chemical byproduct they
generate is probably a highly potent human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   There were two big problems. The first was that the byproduct
seemed to be genotoxic: It damaged genetic material in such a way
that would open the door to cancer formation. The second was even
more alarming: The EPA could not come up with a ``threshold'' level
below which the byproduct would not cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly dismayed at the news, Big Tobacco hired a consultant
with long ties to the WHO and its international standard-setting
bureaucracy, Gaston Vettorazzi, none other than the former head of
the WHO's pesticides division. Vettorazzi immediately set about
cranking out a series of scientific monographs that essentially
denied the EPA's findings, when they didn't simply ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting his reputation as former section head, Vettorazzi
then went back to the WHO, explained that he had numerous clients
interested in pesticides (his successor, John Herrman, was led to
believe that these were pesticide manufacturers) and that this had
led to his doing the monographs as clarification papers.
</P>
<P>
   Herrman, whose division is chronically strapped for funds, like
most of the WHO, gratefully took on Vettorazzi as a volunteer, the
monographs were liberally distributed to the members of the joint
meeting group, and Vettorazzi was eventually made a temporary
expert at the joint meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco's umbrella lobby group, not wishing Vettorazzi to be
out of pocket, managed to come up with $100,000 for each of his two
18-month stints with them, and Philip Morris graciously contributed
$7,000 per month pocket money plus expenses. At no time did
Vettorazzi reveal to anybody at the WHO his connection to Big
Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The climax came when Vettorazzi, as ``temporary expert,`` was
invited to participate in the joint meeting session that would
review the EBDCs. Rief's claim that the decision was critical was
no understatement. If the byproduct was genotoxic and there was no
threshold, the chemicals would be withdrawn from the market, and
there was no comparable replacement product. Period.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO investigating committee found almost no paper trail for
much of Vettorazzi's interactions with the joint meeting people,
but the meeting's conclusions mirrored his monographs' contentions,
and the EPA evidence was similarly either dismissed offhand or
ignored. But that was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's conclusions were then passed on to the Food and
Agriculture Organization's Codex Alimentarius Commission and
incorporated into general international standards. These standards
are enforced by the World Trade Organization. Thus, if any country
were to try to ban the use of EBDCs, it could be brought before the
Trade Organization's tribunal and penalized until the ban was
lifted and compensation for lost sales paid.
</P>
<P>
   It is indicative of the status of the United Nations
standard-setting system that no country has yet challenged the
Joint Meeting's decision on the EBDCs, notwithstanding the EPA's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   But there is yet another dimension, beyond the specter of
hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic chemicals being sprayed on
the good Earth over the years simply because it is profitable to
tobacco companies. The use of EBDCs is not limited to tobacco. They
are also widely used on food crops and they leave residue on those
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the investigating committee, and Zeltner
personally, has called for a thorough review of the procedures that
led to the joint meeting's decision that the use of EBDCs is safe.
There is a further warning about Vettorazzi's dealings with the
Codex Alimentarius Commission (which, being beyond the committee's
mandate, was not investigated) and the whole way international
pesticide safety standards are set.
</P>
<P>
   But there remain other serious problems at the WHO, such as a
disclosure policy for those working there, both paid and unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   (The committee has suggested the EPA disclosure policy is an
example of how to do it right.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the chapter closes with some 20 recommendations, many
quite specific, to avoid in the future such infiltration and
devaluation of the WHO's work.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO head, former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland, has duly taken delivery of the committee's work and
thanked its members for much hard work well done. What the WHO does
with the recommendations remains to be seen.

IS IT TIME FOR FELINES ONLINE?

<P>
   ``Do cats need e-mail?'' asks a press release from MeowMail.com.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they might want e-mail. Cats want so many things. But do
they really need it? My own cats were perfectly happy with their
cell phones until they heard about MeowMail.com. Now they want
their own e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   I blame Stacey Miller and Steve Bennett, who together started
what they like to call ``the first online feline cat colony.''
Although maybe I should blame Maggie, the dog who inspired it. Yes,
a Web site for cats was inspired by a dog. Shocking, no?
</P>
<P>
   Maggie, a dog who lives in Medford with Cynthia Lima, likes to
send e-mail to her many friends of various species, including Chita
McChew and Nala La, the cats who share Miller's Randolph home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Steve about it,'' Miller says, ``and we looked at one
another and we both said `MeowMail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly ``Eureka!'' But it seemed like a timely idea.
This is a cat-crazed culture, and it's getting crazier by the day,
apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think all cats will want to be wired this millennium,''
Miller says. ``After all, your cat only goes around nine times.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cats already are wired, and not just temperamentally. Some
have their own Web sites. The magazine Cats &AMP; Kittens is even
holding a contest for the best cat-related Web design.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Bennett have been having fun with MeowMail.com.
``It's a great way to let our hair down and morph into our cats,''
says Bennett, a communications consultant who lives with a cat
named Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says they have ``thousands'' of registered box holders,
although he wouldn't say just how many thousands. The e-mail
accounts are free. Bennett and Miller have also started selling a
few MeowMail.com products, such as printable cards, notepads, and
letterheads. They contribute a percentage of the sales to Alley Cat
Allies, a national feral cat network based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably fair to say that most of those who visit the site
don't do it to buy anything, but to share the fun. Bennett's and
Miller's feline senses of humor appeal to cat owners, or ``human
valets,'' in the MeowMail.com argot.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a weekly newspaper, The Morning Hairball, with
``All the News That's Fit to Spit.'' This week it coughs up a story
on Cambridge's efforts to create a ``catnip-free'' zone. Previous
scoops have included a look at the controversial tightening of
federal litterbox-emission standards, a story about two heroic cats
who rescued a human stuck up a tree, and a piece about a possible
cure for the rodent-obsessed cat (``Are you consuming rodents? Or
are they consuming you?'').
</P>
<P>
   Cats are polled weekly. In one recent survey, 38 percent said
they think humans should be declawed, 67 percent said they think
they shouldn't be allowed on the furniture, and 90 percent think
they shouldn't be allowed to drink out of the toilet bowl.
</P>
<P>
   MeowMail.com also has an advice columnist, Felinadonna, a cat
who answers questions such as ``What's the proper protocol for
throwing up at human social events?'' The real question,
Felinadonna replies, is not when, but where. ``Well-mannered
felines will always move to carpeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, MeowMail.com knows its audience.

EMMYLOU HARRIS ENLISTS IN THE LAND-MINE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   They make an odd couple, the Grammy-winning country singer and
the disabled Vietnam veteran. After 30 years in the recording
business, Emmylou Harris has little left to prove musically, yet
she continues to break new ground, as she did on her 1995
``Wrecking Ball'' album and ``Western Wall,'' last year's
collaboration with Linda Ronstadt. Harris has seldom been strongly
identified with political or social causes.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years in a wheelchair, Robert Muller has a share of a
Nobel Peace Prize to his credit (awarded in 1997) and
near-universal respect for his work to rid the world of land mines.
However, until two years ago, Muller, president of the Vietnam
Veterans of America Foundation and a former Marine infantry
officer, was on a first-name basis with many more legislators than
singer-songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fate, or something even more powerful, has thrown these two
unlikely allies together. It joined them with such force that as
Muller sat offstage recently at a $1,000-a-seat fund-raising
concert in Weston, where Harris performed a moonstruck 90-minute
set with Nashville sideman Buddy Miller, Muller glanced at the
singer and confessed, ``I'm half in love with Emmy. I really am.
She is truly our savior.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the concert, Harris said, ``I'm an
attention-getting device, I know that. But after going to Cambodia
and Vietnam with Bobby, I've been fully committed to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Harris, who met Muller three years ago through a mutual
friend, ``There are a lot of good causes out there, but this is an
opportunity for me to do something in an area that people need to
know about. I thought land mines were something out of an Audie
Murphy movie. I didn't think they were killing and maiming
civilians all around the world every day.''
</P>
<P>
   What Harris, 53, has done, both in support of Muller's
foundation and in recharting her own career, says a lot about the
recording artist and her priorities. Long admired as a musician's
musician, a peerless harmony singer who has partnered with everyone
from Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison to George Jones and Dolly Parton,
Harris has called in some heavy chips in support of Muller's
efforts. Virtually no one has turned her down.
</P>
<P>
   A series of songwriter-in-the-round benefit concerts put
together by Harris last fall featured the likes of Willie Nelson,
Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams, Nanci Griffith, John
Prine, Bruce Cockburn, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Bonnie Raitt, and Guy
Clark. And like Harris, Cockburn, Earle, Griffith, and Crow have
all toured Southeast Asia with Muller, whose group has established
rehabilitation clinics in some of the world's areas most affected
by land mines, notably Cambodia, Vietnam, and Angola. The concert
series netted the VVAF $175,000, plus priceless amounts of media
exposure, blue-chip connections, and political capital.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than a presence
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris dedicated proceeds from last year's Gram Parsons tribute
album she co-produced to Muller's group as well. At Muller's
behest, she performed at the 1997 Nobel ceremonies in Norway,
televised to 200 million people worldwide. Since then, Muller and
Harris say, the spotlight has largely shifted to other concerns
such as chemical and biological weapons. With nearly 100 million
mines still in the ground, however, and with the United States
balking at signing a global land-mine ban (Harris personally
lobbied fellow Tennessean Al Gore for his support), the urgency is
just as great, they maintain, even if public awareness is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fade from political consciousness, forget it,'' Muller
declared during an interview in Cambridge before the first of two
benefit concerts. ``We're not going to get appropriations for
de-mining operations. It's really the entertainment world that
keeps us in play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not a political issue,'' said Harris. ``The war's
over, we're gone, so people think the issue is resolved. It's not
resolved. The trash we left behind is killing someone every 22
minutes. We take for granted that we can go outside for a walk, or
our children can, without getting our genitals blown off. But
millions of people live with that fear. That's why they call it
terrorism in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to know intellectually that people are victims
of land mines,'' she said. ``It's another thing to actually see it
and how common it is. We're not talking about handicapped-access
countries, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is as good at jawboning Washington pols as she is at
crooning a Louvin Brothers ballad, according to Muller. When the
two of them met with Vice President Gore, Muller recalled, Harris
cut off the pleasantries and immediately began talking up the
land-mine treaty. Senator Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) told Muller, ``If
it wasn't for her, you wouldn't be in here.'' Muller doesn't doubt
that.
</P>
<P>
   For Harris, this crusade coincides with several career changes,
among them a new record label (Nonesuch) and a forthcoming album of
mostly her own tunes, titled ``Red Dirt Girl.'' After ``Wrecking
Ball,'' she decided to jettison her old label (Asylum), management
team, and touring band. Two years on the road had left her in a
professional funk, Harris admitted, who has also been through three
marriages and raised two daughters while fashioning a career that
won her last year's prestigious Billboard Century Award.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the leap
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `` `Wrecking Ball' was a huge creative leap for me,'' she said.
``The downside of a record like that is, what do you follow it
with? Even if you've got the same people backing you, you don't
want to make `Son of Wrecking Ball.' I knew that the one thing I
could bring to the table that would be different this time were my
own words and music.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was also disappointed in how Asylum supported the
record, which won a Grammy _ Harris now has nine overall _ for best
contemporary folk album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed myself to working this record, and I expected the
same from them,'' she said. ``And I didn't get it. If they feel
they can't get a hit song on the radio, most major labels don't
know how to work an artist. They couldn't give me what I needed,
and I couldn't give them what they needed. There's no point in
being bitter about it. Ultimately, the record is there, and nobody
can take that away from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have just as easily played shows where people expect
to hear `Blue Kentucky Girl. I'm not going to forget `Blue Kentucky
Girl,' but that was 20 years ago. And I have something else to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest musical statement, due out next month, ends a
self-described sabbatical during which Harris focused on other
kinds of projects. Her ``Trio II'' album (with Ronstadt and Parton)
and ``Teatro'' (with Willie Nelson) came out, joining ``Western
Wall,'' the Parsons tribute album, and a live album (``Spyboy'') on
store shelves. ``The Ballad of Sally Rose'' (1985) was the last
Harris album on which she served as chief songwriter. ``Western
Wall,'' a warm-up of sorts for ``Red Dirt Girl,'' has three Harris
compositions on it, another indication that at this stage of her
musical life Harris is determined to push forward.
</P>
<P>
   Friends such as ``Wrecking Ball'' producer Daniel Lanois,
engineer Malcolm Burn, and ex-husband Paul Kennerly had been
encouraging Harris to write more, she said. The title track, a
bittersweet tale about an Alabama girl and her unrealized dreams,
was written during a car ride from Nashville to New Orleans, where
``Red Dirt Girl'' was recorded. Harris performed it at the Weston
concert, where it stood out alongside such old chestnuts as
``Pancho and Lefty'' and ``Love Hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still sort of in shock,'' said Harris, ``from three years
ago until last November, when I went in with three songs written.''
By March, when she finished the album, Harris had written eight
more originals, some with Jill Cunniff. ``I don't know where it
came from, and it may never happen again,'' Harris said, shaking
her head. ``But I'm grateful for this record.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn produced and played on the album, recorded at his house in
New Orleans in a deliberately casual setting. Harris is joined by
Buddy Miller, his wife Julie Miller, and musicians Daryl Johnson,
Ethan Johns, Luscious Jackson, and Jill Cunniff. Guest vocalists
include Patti Griffin, Dave Matthews, and Kate McGarrigle. Harris
also realized a longstanding fantasy of hers by getting Patti
Scialfa to sing on one album track. When her husband, Bruce
Springsteen, came up with a third harmony part, said Harris, it was
pinch-me-I'm-dreaming time.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is also excited about signing with Nonesuch Records, a
small New York-based label that, as she said, ``has made its living
on the fringes of the mainstream'' with artists such as Laurie
Anderson and Audra McDonald. ``I may be the most mainstream artist
they have,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   And while her tour this fall will focus on the new album, it's a
safe bet that Harris will continue to mix anti-land-mine messages
with the music. Muller is certainly not about to let her get away.
Being ``half in love'' will do that to a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for the music and get something else,'' he said,
rolling his wheelchair across a soft suburban lawn where guests
nibbled on canapes and strawberries under summertime stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to watch a documentary film about land
mines,'' said Muller, ``but they'll fill a seat to hear Emmy. And
that creates a resonance, a buzz in the industry, that keeps us
alive.''

   CALIF-KIDNAP (Vallejo, Calif.) _ After spending two nights
shackled to the front seat of a kidnapper's car, 8-year-old Midsi
Sanchez finally saw her chance to make a dash for freedom and took
it _ a move that police say may have saved her life. The brave
effort got Midsi out of harm's way and home to Vallejo on Saturday,

always been a small-scale, fairly low-tech affair _ a one-on-one
interaction between orthodontist and patient. It seems a stretch
that a classic Silicon Valley startup could create a role for
itself in this highly local profession, but that is exactly what
seems to be happening with Align Technology, a manufacturer of a
clear plastic alternative to braces aimed at appearance-conscious

there is room for a three-dimensional display. They can now be

ALEC GUINNESS'S ACTING VISION ALWAYS CAPTURED OURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sir Ralph Richardson, Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir John Gielgud,
and now Sir Alec Guinness. They were the monarchs of 20th-century
British acting. With the passing of Guinness last weekend at age
86, the kings are dead. They were kings of different realms _
Richardson of an almost mystical eccentricity, Olivier a high-wire
act of febrile intensity, Gielgud a flow of silvery music.
Guinness's art is the most difficuilt to capture in a phrase.
Partly it's because he was the most self-effacing of the four. He
often said he could never behave like a star because he had to
simply be his personality. Then, in the next breath, he would add
that he didn't have much of a personality.
</P>
<P>
   It was Guinness's chameleon ability to disappear into his
characters, however, that made him, over the long run, the most
successful of the four in film. Not that he would disappear
entirely. One will always remember his eyes, flashing with slyness,
mischief, fun, wary alertness. Time and again, those singular eyes
told us that this or that character knew something we didn't know,
or deliberately wasn't telling us everything. Film is faces, and
faces are eyes. It was Guinness's ability to engage us with his
eyes, yet convince us he was withholding something, making us
wonder what it was, that was most remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   That was the thread that linked so many of his memorable
performances. We somehow never noticed that he was a blue-eyed
Prince Faisal in ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962). As Obi-Wan Kenobi,
he anchored ``Star Wars'' (1977). Guinness persuaded us we felt
Obi-Wan's wisdom. But what first struck us was the twinkle in his
eyes as he doled out guidance to Luke Skywalker. Guinness's eyes
shone with the vision of the well-heeled expatriate liberty he
envisioned as a lowly bank clerk masterminding a gold heist in
``The Lavender Hill Mob'' (1951). He always made larceny look
deliciously naughty. He made instant accomplices of us with the
childlike gleam of pleasure in his eye as the untamable painter
Gulley Jimson in ``The Horse's Mouth'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget the scene in which Gulley stands alone in the
study of the art dealer who made lots of money off him, stuffing an
expensive jade figurine into his baggy pocket. When his respectable
lady friend in the next room, sensing that Gulley is up to no good,
shouts, ``What are you doing?'' he replies, ``I'm bettering
myself.'' Actors often tweak their scripts. ``The Horse's Mouth''
marked the only time Guinness got full writing credit, in this case
for adapting Joyce Cary's novel. Guinness earned an Oscar
nomination for writing that screenplay. His delight in playing a
rascal at one with the unruly impulses of art, and its refusal to
be hemmed in, remains no less zestful today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Bridge' work &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guinness won a best acting Oscar for his interned British
martinet, Colonel Nicholson, in David Lean's ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai'' (1957), playing out a clash of wills with his Japanese
counterpart, Sessue Hayakawa's prison camp commandant. Guinness
researched that role the hard way, observing military types up
close during a wartime navy stint. Guinness said he never was able
to empathize with the blinkered Nicholson. Perhaps it had something
to do with the fact that Guinness was the third choice for the
role, after Charles Laughton and Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was Lean who cast Guinness in the latter's
breakthrough film, ``Great Expectations'' (1946). Lean remembered
Guinness in the latter's own stage adaptation of it in 1939. In the
film, as onstage, he portrayed Herbert Pocket, who befriends
Dickens's young protagonist, Pip, played by John Mills, who was to
become Guinness's lifelong friend. (They acted together in the
lesser-known but first-rate film about a Scottish regiment, ``Tunes
of Glory'' in 1960, and took turns playing Lawrence of Arabia
onstage in the 1960s in ``Ross.'')
</P>
<P>
   A mere two years after playing Pocket, Guinness proved an artful
codger, aging decades to play Fagin in Lean's film of another
Dickens classic, ``Oliver Twist'' (1948). The fruitful
Lean-Guinness collaborations, unhampered by the fact that Guinness
found Lean humorless, ended with ``A Passage to India'' (1984), in
which Guinness, uncharacteristically but persuasively, played a
Hindu mystic. Roles in a series of Ealing Studio comedies first
cemented Guinness's hold on international audiences, starting with
his unprecedented portrayals of eight characters in the disarmingly
dotty comedy of murders, ``Kind Hearts and Coronets'' (1949). In
it, he plays eight members of an aristocratic family standing
between a killer and a title, including a dowager and, of course,
the obligatory vicar. He was a blissful high flyer in ``The Man in
the White Suit'' (1951), carrying over some of that character's
long-bottled-up glee to ``The Lavender Hill Mob.''
</P>
<P>
   To many, this observer included, Guinness hit his criminal peak
in ``The Ladykillers'' (1955). In it, he plays a mad professor
orchestrating grandiose larceny to the hilariously incongruous
strains of Boccherini's Minuet in E Flat, a recording of which he
would play while hatching plans with his gang. The idea was to
throw off the professor's nosy landlady (the immortal Margaret
Rutherford), who had been told that they were a string quintet
meeting behind closed doors to rehearse. The crazed, toothy smile
Guinness slapped on the face of the hyperventilating professor,
making him seem sublimely zany, was his revenge on drama critic
Kenneth Tynan, who had panned a Guinness stage performance. The
public was oblivious to the actor's source of inspiration for his
mad professor, but the tightly knit London film and stage community
recognized it immediately. For them, it was a source of mirth; for
Tynan, a source of discomfort. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A self-effacing tradition &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was a regular participant in Hollywood
mega-productions, ranging from the ponderously respectable ``Doctor
Zhivago'' (1965) to the massively ridiculous ``The Fall of the
Roman Empire'' (1964). Not that he took any of them that seriously.
To be self-effacing, or at least appear so, was a strong part of
the tradition out of which he came, starting when Gielgud, a
frequent collaborator-to-be, cast him as Osric and the Third Player
in ``Hamlet'' in 1934 following Guinness's wordless West End debut
the year before as a jury member in ``Libel!'' By 1938, Guinness
was starring in his own ``Hamlet,'' a modern dress version. Some
obituaries listed ``Great Expectations'' as his first screen
credit. Actually, Guinness first appeared as an uncredited extra, a
World War I soldier in a concert audience in ``Evensong'' (1934).
</P>
<P>
   He later was to revel in virtual invisibility, especially in his
mesmerizing TV portrayal of John Le Carre's spymaster, George
Smiley, in ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' (1980) and ``Smiley's
People'' (1982). Remarkably, he was able to triumph over his own
lack of physical resemblance to Smiley. As Le Carre described him,
Smiley was fatter, with several chins. Le Carre's Smiley suggested
an Alfred Hitchcock ringer. But Guinness drew our attention to his
eyes, not his lack of chins. Those eyes were filled with acuteness,
pain, worldweariness and a refusal to buckle despite a life
betrayed by everyone on his side _ wife, fellow spies, bureaucrats.
The scene in which Smiley blandly soldiers through a Whitehall
budget meeting, surrounded by back-stabbing bureaucrats, mumbling
into his chins, never completing a sentence, but somehow emerging
with everything he wants, is one of the century's sublime pieces of
high comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley's way with the bureaucrats was not unlike Guinness's way
with acting. He never was obvious, yet always seemed to get what he
wanted _ from a role, a film, a career. More of a literary man than
he ever let on except when he surfaced with that screenplay credit
for ``The Horse's Mouth,'' he appreciated irony. Until ``Star
Wars,'' which he came to describe as his pension, he never earned
astronomical sums. Because George Lucas was broke, he signed
Guinness for 2 1/4 percent of the gross. ``Star Wars'' grossed
hundreds of millions. Guinness, late in life, earned millions from
it. Not that it deepened his respect for the film. He persuaded
Lucas to rewrite it so Obi-Wan could die sooner. Convincing
audiences he was Hitler and Sigmund Freud and, onstage (where he
maintained he did his best work), Dylan Thomas, took some doing.
Donning a hooded robe and sounding wise did not. ``They think I
really am a Jedi knight instead of just a Knight of the British
Empire,'' Guinness once said in a radio interview, in his
inimitably dry, measured tones, pronouncing Jedi as if it rhymed
with ready. ``They think I have wisdom!''

   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention

the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Watkins Park, with its meandering stream and its
thicket of greenery, is as bucolic as downtown Indianapolis gets.
But look a wee bit more closely _ or inhale a wee bit more deeply _
and reality intrudes. ``My God, look at that crap!'' shouts Tom
Neltner. As as activist environmentalist, he knows whereof he
speaks, and there it is: raw sewage, as well as condoms, clearly
visible in the stream. This rustic scene comes courtesy of
Indianapolis's ``combined sewer overflow'' (CSO) system, which was
designed nearly a century ago to carry both sewage and storm water
through one set of pipes. &LR;  &QL;

Argentina is one of deep depression, manifested in recent days by
an outpouring of anguished self-analysis over the suicide of a

stockbroking in American in 1996-99, it was natural that American
online brokers would start expanding into Europe. Natural, too,
that their eyes should alight first on good old Britain:
English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the privatizations of the
1980s, home to a broad-based ``shareholder culture.'' Yet Britain
is proving slower to embrace online investing than are continental
countries, supposedly so much more leery of the American way of

   (UNDATED) _ ``Dear Tony,'' begins the earnest memo from one
policy wonk to another. ``Knowing ouir shared interest in global
climate change, I have enclosed a report on the benefits of
greenhouse gas emissions trading... With best regards, Bill.'' The
casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge. First, this letter,
penned recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, is about an issue both take seriously: global
warming. Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen
Claussen, the head of the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change, has now become. Why does Claussen _ the scourge of
global-warming skeptics _ have the ear of the world's most powerful
man? The answer is that she knows how to dance circles around the

retailers. While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney
and Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers _ such as Gap,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Office Depot _
are only now hitting trouble. There are many reasons, but above
all, the fat years of the recent past have tempted store groups
into over-ambitious expansion plans. &QL;

the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay). As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of
his firm, Ghai is jazzed by the idea of building a Hollywood-style
studio that hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and
technicians. Some optimists even see India as a low-cost producer
for the global movie industry. Film City, a newly expanded
2,000-acre complex on the outskirts of Hyderabad, offers 40 studio
floors and sophisticated post-production facilities; it has already
attracted a handful of movie-makers from Hollywood. &QL;

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Watkins Park, with its meandering stream and its
thicket of greenery, is as bucolic as downtown Indianapolis gets.
But look a wee bit more closely _ or inhale a wee bit more deeply _
and reality intrudes. ``My God, look at that crap!'' shouts Tom
Neltner. As as activist environmentalist, he knows whereof he
speaks, and there it is: raw sewage, as well as condoms, clearly
visible in the stream. This rustic scene comes courtesy of
Indianapolis's ``combined sewer overflow'' (CSO) system, which was
designed nearly a century ago to carry both sewage and storm water
through one set of pipes. &LR;  &QL;

   BUENOS AIRES _ Not for nothing does Buenos Aires claim to have
more psychoanalysts per square mile than any other city in the
world. Good thing, too, for at the moment the national mood in
Argentina is one of deep depression, manifested in recent days by
an outpouring of anguished self-analysis over the suicide of a
well-known surgeon. And the sense of despair goes wider still: a
million or more Argentines flocked this week to the shrine of San
Cayetano, patron saint of labor, praying for his help to find work.
At least Argentina's psychoanalysts should face no problems finding
work in the coming months. &QL;

casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge. First, this letter,
penned recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, is about an issue both take seriously: global
warming. Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen
Claussen, the head of the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change, has now become. Why does Claussen _ the scourge of
global-warming skeptics _ have the ear of the world's most powerful
man? The answer is that she knows how to dance circles around the

peacetime expansion, but somebody has forgotten to tell its
retailers. While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney
and Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers _ such as Gap,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Office Depot _
are only now hitting trouble. There are many reasons, but above
all, the fat years of the recent past have tempted store groups
into over-ambitious expansion plans. &QL;

<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Every time Camryn Manheim sees one of the
``reality'' shows that have engulfed television, she smolders at
the thought of what she's not seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about my comrades, my actor friends, who should be in
those slots,'' said Manheim, a mainstay of ABC's ``The Practice.''
``Let our artists work!''
</P>
<P>
   This has been an odd, unsettling summer for the actors, writers,
and producers who ply their trade on the entertainment side of the
TV business. Prime time has been colonized by unscripted programs
that don't need the services of those who create dramas and
sitcoms. The shift from ``fiction'' to ``nonfiction'' has left some
TV veterans wondering what role is left for the medium's
storytellers, and whether TV's creative muscles will atrophy from
disuse.
</P>
<P>
   As Manheim suggested, the picture is no brighter for performers.
The ``casts'' of the summer's most talked-about shows are unknowns
who don't carry SAG or AFTRA cards: the contestants on CBS's
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' the students on Fox's ``American
High,'' the wannabe pop stars on ABC's ``Making the Band,'' and, of
course, the average Joes and Josephines on ABC's ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' (hosted by Regis Philbin, but given dramatic oomph
by its contestants).
</P>
<P>
   The backlash was given voice by scriptwriters Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel in an essay in a recent TV Guide headlined ``Reality
TV Bites.'' The pair asked: ``What ever happened to the concept of
being entertained by professional entertainers _ people who are
more talented than our friends and family? Bombast and
shamelessness have become a substitute for talent. People with
nothing to say are being given the opportunity to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they'll be given the opportunity to say a lot more. The
networks are scrambling to develop still more reality series, with
at least half a dozen already planned for mid-season or the
2001-2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send in the clones,'' growled a skeptical Dick Wolf, executive
producer of NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``Deadline,'' a new newspaper
drama. ``Every time something happens, then everybody wants to
imitate it.'' Yet even Wolf seems to have concluded that if you
can't beat 'em, join 'em: He will premiere a syndicated reality
show of his own this fall titled ``Arrest and Trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reality craze could fade as quickly as it
ignited. That hope was voiced repeatedly by actors and producers in
interviews here and in sessions before TV critics. Drawing hope
from recent history, they pointed to the failure of a spate of
copycat quiz shows launched last year in an attempt to duplicate
the success of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short-term fallout
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term at least, the fallout from the reality
binge is considerable. The implications for the ``creative
community'' were apparent when the networks rolled out their
schedules here last month.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage of dramas and sitcoms was most acute at ABC, which
introduced four new programs, the fewest in recent memory. The
reason for the dropoff isn't hard to pinpoint: A hefty chunk of
ABC's fall schedule will consist of programs that could be lumped
together as nonfiction, either ``Millionaire'' (four times a week),
newsmagazines, such as ``20/20,'' or ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC entertainment chief Scott Sassa also made it clear that
the Peacock Network _ home of many of the leading sitcoms and
dramas of the past decade _ is making the development of nonfiction
programs a top priority. CBS, meanwhile, has led the reality charge
this summer, even though last year, network president Leslie
Moonves argued that for every quiz show or reality series on the
air, 100 people in Hollywood were thrown out of work.
</P>
<P>
   All the network executives speak of having ``balance'' in their
schedules, and none appears ready to jettison dramas and sitcoms
and tie their networks' fortunes to reality TV. Nonetheless, some
in the TV industry are already adapting to the new reality.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with the market for fictional TV contracting (at
least on the broadcast networks), some writers have curtailed
ambitions to launch their own shows and taken jobs as staff writers
on existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley, executive producer of ``The Practice'' along
with Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' and the upcoming ``Boston Public,'' said
that ``if there's been one blessing in the dawn of reality-TV
programming, it's been there's much less pilot development, and a
lot of writers who would be off doing their own pilots, getting
their own shows, are now falling back into ranks where they're
available to go on staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a result, I have the strongest writing staffs that I've
ever had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the creative community is on the run, its members have
themselves partly to blame, in the view of Edward Zwick, co-creator
and executive producer of ABC's ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about it a lot lately,'' he said. Zwick
maintained that the success of reality programs is partly due to
``the failure of certain writers and producers'' to create dramas
and comedies that ``describe real people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see something that reflects themselves more
accurately,'' said Zwick. ``The appetite for the breadth of life _
that's always existed.'' Instead, he said, television has primarily
dished up rosy scenarios and pat resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   However, other creators of ``fictional'' TV scoff at claims for
the reality genre's verisimilitude. They argue that such programs
rest on contrived situations (how often, they ask, do a dozen
strangers end up on a deserted island or jammed into a house on a
studio lot?) and that reality programs are sometimes as boring as .
. . well, as real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a reality show gets into some real drama, you can get
caught up in it,'' said Chuck Lorre, executive producer of ``Dharma
&AMP; Greg'' on ABC. ``When it's a bunch of people sitting around
watching paint dry, you can feel pretty stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No future
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Thigpen, co-star of CBS's ``The District,'' suggested that
viewers may eventually be turned off. ``There's no way to get away
from the word `voyeuristic,' '' said Thigpen. ``They try to talk
around it, but that's what it is. I don't think anybody thinks that
reality television is the wave of the future. It might be the wave
of the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be wishful thinking, or it may be a genuine conviction,
but numerous actors and producers echo Thigpen in arguing that
reality TV is no more than a flash in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has its moment, but I don't think that anything
will ever take the place of storytelling,'' said Calista Flockhart,
star of ``Ally McBeal.'' ``Storytelling has been around since the
beginning of time. People need it. People crave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Richard Schiff, who plays White House communications
director Toby Ziegler on NBC's ``The West Wing'': ``As soon as you
get 15 people imitating it, you get dilution. It becomes just so
much noise. I'm very unafraid of the reality movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco, executive producer of CBS's ``City of Angels''
and ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' said ``there's always going to be room for
something bizarre,'' but he has learned after 30 years in the TV
business that ``everything cycles, things come and go, but
ultimately, it's about entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Frankie Muniz, the 14-year-old star of Fox's ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' takes the long view of reality programs. ``When
`Millionaire' first came out, it was all anybody talked about, but
now it doesn't seem so huge,'' he said. ``They're not going to be
on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Manheim certainly hopes so. Professing both puzzlement and
dismay at the ``love affair with reality TV,'' she voiced the
desire of many in her profession that television will return to its
roots. ``I'd like to see us get back to being a prime-time
entertainment medium.''

THE `SENSATION OF POWER': PERLMAN TAKES UP THE BATON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Itzhak Perlman, principal guest conductor of the Detroit
Symphony, has been an annual visitor to Tanglewood throughout his
career. Along with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Yo-Yo Ma, he
is among the festival's most enduringly popular attractions. He has
appeared as concerto soloist, chamber-music player, and recitalist;
Saturday night he takes his first bow in his new capacity as
conductor. His program includes symphonies by Brahms and Mozart,
and he will also lead Beethoven's Romances for violin and orchestra
from the violin.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman, 54, called in recently to talk about this recent
development in his career, which began about five years ago in a
six-week institute founded by his wife, Toby, to help train
college- or conservatory-bound young musicians, the Perlman Music
Program. (``A little name recognition helps raise money,'' the
violinist confesses.) This experiment proved so successful that
Perlman began to work with professional orchestras as well; he has
led the Chicago and Houston symphonies as well as the Israel
Philharmonic, so he says he will come to Tanglewood as a
``veteran'' interpreter of the Brahms Fourth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Several international violin virtuosos have preceded Perlman to
the podium (Georges Enesco and Yehudi Menuhin, among others), and
the ranks of conductors are full of former concertmasters and
violin section veterans (Joseph Silverstein, Charles Dutoit,
Neville Marriner). Asked what the appeal of conducting is, Perlman
responds, characteristically, with a joke: ``It's the power, the
sensation of power.'' Then his voice turns more serious as he
continues. ``The real appeal is new repertory and new musical
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also it's quite fascinating to see how feeling transfers to a
group of musicians through motion _ just how does one subtle
movement of the hand and arm, or a change of facial expression,
create an entirely different sound? This is the great mystery of
conducting. When I am playing the violin, I am totally in control
of what I am doing. When I am conducting, this is not always the
case. I feel I have embarked on an adventure of discovery. I have
been especially lucky to work with such wonderful orchestras _ with
them, words are not often necessary; they know what to do when you
show them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perlman Music Program started out on Long Island; now it has
its own home on Shelter Island, where the orchestra rehearses in a
tent before coming into Manhattan to perform in Avery Fisher Hall
in Lincoln Center. ``In the tent, we work very hard to get a sound,
but when we get into the hall and the players hear what they are
doing in that acoustic, the look on their faces of bewilderment and
awe is amazing. The oldest players are 18, but most of them are 12
to 15. It was my wife who suggested that I try to conduct them, and
all of us enjoyed it. I had taken some conducting classes when I
was still a student at Juilliard. We just did Tchaikovsky's
`Serenade' for strings, which is not an easy piece, and the kids
did a really great job. When there were nice results with the kids,
I thought I would try to work with professional musicians too, and
see what happened.''

   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In addition to attending conducting classes, Perlman has taken
careful note while working with most of the prominent conductors
active during the last 40 years. ``Yes, I've had the benefit of the
experience of great and not-so-great conductors _ both kinds of
experience were equally beneficial. I know what's a bad thing to
try to do, and what's good. An awful lot of the things I do come to
me naturally; if something doesn't work, I start asking myself
questions. I bring the same philosophy to conducting that I do to
teaching. Whenever somebody doesn't do what you want them to do, it
isn't their fault _ it's yours. What you're trying to do is to
suggest things, to try to get people to play the music the way you
hear it, whether it's right or wrong. When you get what you are
looking for, that's tremendously satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman says he never wants to patronize musicians. ``It is
important to put everything in a positive way. For every minus,
there is a plus. If something doesn't sound good, you should talk
about bringing it up to the level of something else that they have
already done well. There is no room any more for brutal
hit-them-over-the-head criticism. I have never liked that approach
in anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he wants to hear in the Brahms Fourth, Perlman
replies, ``I just want to hear the Brahms in it. This happened to
be the first symphony by Brahms I ever heard. I was about 16 at the
time _ I was a late bloomer when it came to things outside the
violin repertory. After I heard it, I couldn't sleep all night, and
during the day I just wanted to keep repeating the recording. The
first time I every hear anything wonderful that wasn't written for
the violin, I wish I were a cellist or a singer or a pianist or an
orchestra! In Brahms I want to hear romanticism, great washes of
sound, together with clarity, and I will try to do the best I can
to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Perlman will bring his lifelong experience of the
Brahms Violin Concerto to bear on the symphony. ``The concerto is a
very symphonic work; the phrases arch the same way. The music is
different, but the conception of the music is the same. If you are
playing the concerto, it really helps to understand the textures of
the winds, the strings, and the brasses. To conduct means to play
an instrument but without actually playing it. When I play the
violin, I worry about myself; when I conduct, I worry about other
people.''

</P>
<P>
   Seeing more clearly
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some listeners have noted new qualities in Perlman's playing
since he started conducting. Perlman has noticed them too. ``I feel
I see things more clearly now, and I have a different feeling for
rhythm. I am able to ask more of myself than before, and I am aware
of what is happening around me in a different way. The other day,
during a concert, I was saying to myself, `Here I want a little bit
more _ so go ahead and do it!' And I did it.' Afterwards, I said to
myself, `Hey, this is great. I can listen to myself in a different
way.' Dynamics are incredibly important, and so are silences. The
not playing is just as important as the playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, what I am learning is pacing. Here and there you
can do a little bit of this and a little bit of that, but it is
important to make sure that a piece really holds together. The
phrases, the line, have to hold. This is what a conductor has to
deal with, but a solo artist should be dealing with it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman, who recently became a grandparent, says that three of
his five children are playing music. One daughter is a pianist,
with an active career and a first CD on the way; another daughter
is a singer who, her proud father says, ``is sounding good.'' The
youngest child, 16, is a ``serious flute player'' who is studying
at Juilliard. A fourth child is a lawyer, and the other divides his
time between his rock band and ``very serious painting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in good shape,'' Perlman says proudly, ``and we
have a very interesting household.''

<P>
   With the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their convention
next week, America's voters will have before them four men bidding
to lead their country. Should they choose the pragmatic politician,
the co-chief executive of their country, who has supervised eight
years of staggering prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   Or what about the dreamy idealist, the policy wonk absorbed by
technology and the environment? Or perhaps the sour, partisan
reactionary _ a brutal attack dog who specializes in ripping apart
the ``risky'' dreams of others?
</P>
<P>
   Or then again, there is the panicky panderer, who changes his
mind about a small Cuban boy's future just to win a few votes in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be too difficult, but for one thing: all four of
these men are Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, consistency is hardly the political profession's main
speciality; the vice president's Republican opponent, George W.
Bush, to name but one, has courted and dropped the religious right
at least twice during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But, given his prominence in public life, the level of doubt not
just about the vice president's basic beliefs but also his
character is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are not just four Gores to choose from. The whole
tribe could form a queue around the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than providing the usual opportunity to help cull their
number, the campaign so far has merely added more Gores, some of
them (class-warrior Gore, outsider Gore) indecently farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   Even within his personal heartland _ the environment _ there is
a chasm between the eco-zealotry of his recently reissued book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' and the mild measures the vice president
says he wants to enact.
</P>
<P>
   This ambiguity, particularly the sour side of it, is one reason
why many people seem more comfortable with the easier-to-follow
Bush. Fresh from his own convention in Philadelphia, some opinion
polls have put the Texan governor as much as 17 percentage points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can expect to get a post-convention bounce in the polls as
well, especially given his bold and tactically shrewd choice as his
running-mate of Senator Joseph Lieberman, Bill Clinton's most
prominent Democratic critic over Monica and morals.
</P>
<P>
   But will that be enough? Although Nov. 7 is still a long way
off, no candidate in recent history has rebounded to win having
been behind at the start of September.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is formidable. Yet one thing is clear: Gore should
be an impressive candidate _ and could still become one. After all,
Gore has no need to prove his competence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Republican National Convention, The Economist asked,
``Is Mr. Bush ready?'' No such doubts exist about a man who already
runs much of the White House's business.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, probably the most involved vice president in history, has
spent a lifetime preparing for the presidency. On wonkish issues
like missile defense, Gore has probably forgotten more than Bush
will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some of the main issues of the election _ medical care
and Social Security _ are ones where voters have traditionally
preferred Democrats. Gore's incremental approach may be less daring
and prove ultimately less effective than Bush's; but it may be more
in line with voters' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Gore, as the inheritor of the Clinton economy, has an
impressive record to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Republicans ask Americans to turn their backs on
the 1990s, they sound like those spoilsport Democrats did during
the Reaganite 1980s. Most Americans have never had it so good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already been snarling at Bush's ``risky'' schemes to
endanger that prosperity (not to mention all his other risky plans
for education and Social Security).
</P>
<P>
   A negative campaign can go a long way _ as Gore proved in the
primaries when he ripped apart Bill Bradley's health-care reforms,
whilst offering precious few new ideas of his own. Yet attack can
also backfire. After all, Americans currently give the credit for
their economic good fortune more to the Federal Reserve than the
White House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of Clinton fatigue: ``change, versus
more of the same,'' as the great man's own campaigners once put it.
And the more Gore snarls, the more he risks emphasizing one of his
weaknesses _ that unlike Clinton and, it seems, Bush, voters do not
find him likeable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, at the upcoming convention, Gore has to speak
convincingly about himself _ and about what he actually believes
in. One advantage of his current predicament is that he now has a
relatively blank slate on which to draw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper's hopes for what he might actually say range from
sadly unrealistic fantasies (he deserts the teachers' unions and
promises structural reform in America's schools) to unlikely hopes
(he revokes his waffle about ``fair trade''), to reasonable
expectations (he expands his measures for gun control).
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's general instincts seem creditable _ his
internationalism, for instance; others, particularly his faith in
government intervention, less so. No matter: Bush also has his
faults. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is to give more indication of what a Gore
presidency might be like. Two people might serve as role models.
The first, bizarrely, is Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, the then-vice president seemed sour and
unfocused and was also at one point 17 points behind a successful
governor, Michael Dukakis. His eventual victory owed much to a very
nasty campaign, which traduced his rival's record.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the lesson, Gore's team, partly staffed by former
Dukakis people, would have no qualms about copying.
</P>
<P>
   But, in 1988, the older Bush also offered a little more. At his
convention, the man derided as ``every woman's first husband''
emerged as an independent character _ and stepped out from
President Ronald Reagan's shadow. Gore now similarly needs to shrug
off Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The second is Lieberman. Not only does the Connecticut senator
convey a much firmer moral compass than Gore; the very act of
choosing him has already shown a bolder side to the vice president
on which he now needs to build.
</P>
<P>
   Some spinmasters argued against putting a Jew, extraordinarily
for the first time ever, on a national ticket; now nobody can
understand what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore goes on to win, Lieberman may prove to have been the
turning point. But that will surely only happen if Gore presents
the American people with a coherent account of what his presidency
would be like.
</P>
<P>
   His last chance to start doing that will come in Los Angeles
next week. &QL;

KASHMIR PEACE PROCESS: BACK TO GROUND ZERO

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   After barely a fortnight of frail life, the peace process in
Jammu &AMP; Kashmir is officially dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahideen, one of the main groups fighting India's rule
in its only Muslim-majority state, had on July 24 called a
cease-fire and said it would like to talk to the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it imposed an ultimatum: the talks would have to include
Pakistan, which controls a third of Kashmir and regards India's
portion as its rightful inheritance, or the cease-fire would be
called off.
</P>
<P>
   India ignored the ultimatum, and on Aug. 8 Hizbul Mujahideen
said it would fight on.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict seems to be back to the same hopeless state in
which it has languished for 53 years _ except that nowadays, on a
whim of either India or Pakistan, it could turn nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to some rumors, Pakistan and India have, despite
appearances, already struck a secret deal on the future of Kashmir,
making the end of the truce nothing more than a tactical maneuver.
That seems unlikely, though nothing can be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the past hopeful fortnight's events turn out to be no
more than a feint in the direction of peace, though, they have
revealed the contours of how a peace process might evolve.
</P>
<P>
   First, it should be understood that the stated obstacles to
peace are not the real ones.
</P>
<P>
   India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, dispensed quickly
with the main Indian objection to talks with the rebels, who want
either independence for Kashmir or union with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Though India could not transgress its own constitution, Vajpayee
dropped his insistence that the rebels had to accept it as a
condition for talks. India should deal with them on the basis of
insaniyat (humanity), he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speed and flexibility of his response to the cease-fire gave
the rebels little excuse for backing out. Nonetheless, Hizbul
Mujahideen found one, in the form of a demand that Pakistan had to
be party to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   India rejected that for two reasons. First, it regards Pakistan
as the author of violence in Kashmir, whether it was last year's
harebrained attempt to grab territory on India's side of the line
of control or last week's horrible series of massacres in which
over 100 people died.
</P>
<P>
   More profoundly, India regards Kashmir as its territory and the
discontent of the Kashmiris as an internal matter. Even so, dual
talks could have been embarked upon, perhaps by treating them as
separate processes.
</P>
<P>
   The real hurdles to peace are, first, India's bumbling and
brutal treatment of a people who have never been certain whether
they belonged with India, Pakistan or on their own; and, second,
Pakistan's stake in their discontent.
</P>
<P>
   While it lasted, the cease-fire offered a glimpse of a way over
the first hurdle. India would have started by talking to Hizbul
Mujahideen, which, unlike most of the other militant groups, is
dominated by Kashmiris rather than outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The talks would have gradually been extended to take in other
separatist groups, including at least some of the 23 members of the
All-Party Hurriyat Conference. Eventually, they would have
encompassed all shades of opinion in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Such talks would get nowhere, however, without tangible
improvements in India's administration of Kashmir. Each stretch of
the track would add strain.
</P>
<P>
   The state's ruling party, despised by most Kashmiri Muslims, has
no wish to make way for pacified militants. Vajpayee's own party,
the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is ideologically
disinclined to make the sort of concessions that might pacify them.
Sooner or later, these issues must be faced.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre and the ultimatum suggest that Pakistan, or groups
over which Pakistan's government has some influence, can veto any
move towards peace and has strong reason to. But India has, in
essence, everything else it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Though India formally claims all of Kashmir, including the areas
now controlled by Pakistan and China, it would probably settle for
the status quo, turning the present line of control into the
international border.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan thinks, probably wrongly, that violence can force India
to grant Kashmir ``self-determination.'' Pakistan's incentive to
disrupt any truce is like that of a gunslinger in a poker game who
knows he holds low cards.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can help blunt that incentive. In March Bill Clinton,
stopping briefly in Pakistan on his way home from India, declared
that ``this era does not reward people who struggle in vain to
redraw borders with blood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that behind the scenes America has been
cajoling Pakistan to restrain the militants. It had been hoping
that the country's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, was
desperate enough for economic aid to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Hizbul Mujahideen's cease-fire proposal looked like the fruit of
that pressure. Although the truce has broken down, progress need
not come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   India should continue with its peace offensive, preaching and
practicing insaniyat. That means talking to willing Kashmiris,
restoring democratic decency to the state and allowing its citizens
to be architects of their own future.
</P>
<P>
   India will not be chided for refusing tripartite talks at the
point of a gun, but it cannot forever dodge talking to Pakistan
about Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage, Vajpayee and General Musharraf will have to meet.
Pakistan and Hizbul Mujahideen will have to return to the
negotiating table, leaving their guns at the door. They may not win
back the rest of Kashmir. But a durable peace that ended the threat
of nuclear war would be quite a consolation prize. &QL;

<P>
   Millions of Americans will this week have found themselves in
the unusual position of agreeing with Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Both George W. Bush and Al Gore are ``boring,'' said the Cuban
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer hypocrisy, Bush and Gore might reply. After all, for four
decades, Castro has notoriously bored his long-suffering people
with speeches lasting hour after hour: in the view of the old
guerrilla, it has always seemed, fatigues are not just to be worn
but also to be inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Castro was merely trying to extract advantage from a
recent and little-noticed change of heart. For Cuba's president has
at last realized that, when it comes to words, less can be more.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Castro broke the news of this revolutionary
change _ but in characteristic fashion. ``I have reached the
conclusion, a bit late perhaps, that speeches should be short,'' he
told Granma, the Cuban Communist Party daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Well, better late than never, even if this startling admission
came at the end of an interview that filled four pages of fine
print. More remarkable, however, is that Castro has been as good as
his new, short, word: none of his recent speeches has lasted longer
than 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And on July 26, a big anniversary in Cuba's revolutionary
calendar and always good for several hours of uninterrupted
oratory, the old windbag's harangue lasted less than half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Cubans will no doubt be delighted. Anyone who has stood
through a Castro speech in Cuba's tropical sun will know that even
mad dogs and Englishmen risk keeling over from heatstroke as the
latest sugar harvest is dissected in mind-numbing statistical
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden urge for brevity will doubtless also be celebrated by
the 73-year-old's enemies, but as a sign of failing vigor. They may
be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Communist government is using ``new and efficient media
methods'' to get its message across. Does this mean that Castro is
about to embrace that dreaded imperialist tool, the soundbite?
</P>
<P>
   Doubters will explain that Latins hate silence, and that
long-winded speeches are therefore intrinsic to Latin American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   In support, they may cite the example of Hugo Chavez,
Venezuela's paratrooper-turned-president, who, intoxicated by the
exuberance of his own verbosity, is doing his best to imitate the
lengthy speeches that Castro has just vowed to eschew. Last week he
entertained the press to a three-hour news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But is prolixity really Latin American? This year's Cervantes
prize, the highest literary award in the Spanish-speaking world,
went to Augusto Monterroso, a Guatemalan novelist celebrated partly
for a short story about the seemingly never-ending rule of Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party. It consisted of just one
sentence. (``When he woke up, the dinosaur was still there.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now, happily, Mexico's dinosaur is about to depart, after an
election campaign that was notable for its cacophony of soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an inevitable part of political life in Latin
America, the long-winded speech is the mark of the caudillo.
Monologue is inherently undemocratic: it demands the kind of
buttock-aching passivity to be found only among the cowed or the
deferential _ appropriate perhaps to a medieval court, but not to a
modern polity.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains now is for Castro to allow other, dissenting,
voices to fill some of the silences he proposes to leave. For
Cubans, that would be an even more welcome revolution. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Before the current stage of the presidential
campaign began, conventional wisdom (excuse the term) held that
George W. Bush's choice of running mate would define his candidacy
but the Republican shindig would not.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, it was thought that Al Gore's running mate would
hardly matter (because the options were all so dismal) but his
speech to the Democratic National Convention would be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   So far, every part of this wisdom has turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's choice of running mate said little more than that he
likes to surround himself with well-qualified politicians with
conservative voting records.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention, on the other hand, was an eye-opener,
showing what the ``new Republican Party'' is willing to do to
attract independents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore's choice of Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut may
go as far as any vice-presidential pick can go towards changing
perceptions about a candidate. It gives a spark of excitement to a
candidacy that has so far plodded from one unconvincing moment to
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is an axiom of American politics that a huge problem for any
incumbent vice president is to distinguish himself from the
president without repudiating the record on which he is running.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Gore's task should be easier than most. He should
be able to distance himself from the personal lapses while
endorsing the policy achievements. In practice it has been harder,
since, during the Lewinsky scandal, he felt obliged to be loyal to
his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democrat to attack Clinton during the
Lewinsky affair, saying on the Senate floor that the president's
behavior was not just inappropriate but immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking innocence by association will not help Gore overcome
``Clinton fatigue'' at a stroke. Nor will it remove the question of
presidential morality from the debate (arguably, it puts the matter
back near the top of the agenda for a while).
</P>
<P>
   But it will blunt the force of criticism because Republicans can
no longer say _ as Dick Cheney did in Philadelphia _ that ``it is
not possible to look at (Gore) without thinking about (Clinton).''
It now is.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the choice of Lieberman may encourage voters
to reassess Gore himself. This is not just because, as both men
have repeatedly said, Lieberman is the first Jew on the
presidential ticket of a big party. Rather, it is because some of
the qualities that make him unusual are shared by Gore too.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were two of only ten Democrats in the Senate
to vote for the Gulf war. Lieberman's religious side _ he observes
Orthodox Jewish practices, and quoted the Book of Chronicles when
his nomination was announced _ chimes with Gore's less remarked
upon, but still marked, Baptist faith.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman hands out ``silver sewer'' awards to ``culturally
polluting'' movies, music or videos. One of the first people who
tried to shame the entertainment industry into restraint was Gore's
wife, Tipper, in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a small personal link. Orthodox Jews may not drive
on the Sabbath. When there was a Senate vote on that day, Lieberman
used to stay at an apartment near the Capitol owned by the Gores,
and the Shabbosgoy (the Gentile who would do other banned things
like turning on the lights) was none other than Al.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman had been merely a pillar of rectitude with no
connection with Gore, his selection would have been tokenism. As it
is, his reputation may help to improve Gore's own.
</P>
<P>
   And, as an immediate consequence, it should help him both with
socially conservative voters _ notably suburban women and
blue-collar men, among whom Gore is getting hammered _ and with the
large number of people who disapprove of Clinton personally but
like his policies.
</P>
<P>
   In picking Lieberman, Gore did something unusual: he took a
risk. He did so with Lieberman's religion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism in America is less potent than it used to be, but
it has not vanished. One Jewish candidate was defeated by a rival
who went around asking, ``How can North Carolina have a
representative in Washington who won't eat North Carolina
barbecue?'' (the state is famous for barbecued pork). That was in a
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how widespread this attitude is. But people are
more prejudiced than they are willing to tell others, and in one
recent poll 6 percent of the population still said they would not
vote for a Jewish candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also a risk on particular issues. He has spoken
in favor of the partial privatization of Social Security _ which
Gore excoriates Bush for proposing. He has favored school vouchers
_ for which Gore excoriated Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has now backed off both ideas, and even though in
general his policies are similar to Gore's, the Democratic ticket
still looks less than united on these two controversial policies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, Lieberman is a risk to party unity. Vouchers
are anathema to the teachers' unions (a huge proportion of
delegates at next week's Democratic Convention are teachers). His
campaign against pornography is anathema to Hollywood. His support
of free trade is unpopular with unions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he offends three large Democratic interest
groups at a time when Gore has not yet nailed down the support of
the whole party.
</P>
<P>
   With Ralph Nader ready to snap up all Democrats who put ideology
above party, the risk is not trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats have lauded the nomination. But that is partly
because Lieberman has backtracked on Social Security and education,
two of the issues that endeared him to independent voters in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore took a gamble and, in bringing it off, has lessened
his reputation as a shameless panderer.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the most important decision of his campaign so far
and, on balance, it is a good one. But it is good, mainly, because
of its shock value.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will cause voters to look at Gore anew. The question
is what Gore does then. He has to appeal to the center, solidify
the base and clarify what his candidacy is about.
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task, and one that Gore must confront alone. To
that extent, the last part of the conventional wisdom _ that the
Democratic gathering next week is vital for Gore _ still seems
right. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``There's a lot at stake in this election and real
differences between the two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Lieberman said that at the war memorial in Nashville
just after Al Gore had formally picked him as the Democratic
running mate, it sounded like the sort of remark _ simultaneously
bland and exaggerated _ that politicians perpetrate when they have
nothing much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was both surprising and true. It was surprising
because for most Americans, and almost all foreigners, this is one
of the least gripping elections on record.
</P>
<P>
   Many still think of it as the Gush versus Bore contest _ between
two cautious scions of America's political aristocracy rushing
towards the electoral center offering undistinguished and
indistinguishable policy platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comment is also true because for the first time in
decades almost any electoral result is conceivable, ranging from a
clean sweep of the presidency, Senate and House of Representatives
by the Republicans, to a clean sweep by the Democrats _ or any
combination in between.
</P>
<P>
   That means the winner could end up with a degree of control not
seen since the Eisenhower administration and would be able to
influence policy for years afterwards through its control of the
many appointments to the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve
Board that fall due during the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between what people seem to think about this
election and what is actually at stake is becoming more striking
during the current convention season _ ``the most critical period
of the campaign,'' claims Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   There may still be few clear signs that America's apathetic
voters are aware what their decision in November could do to their
country. But something is beginning to click. The gravitas of the
candidates and the sharpness of their policy differences have both
increased over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has never been accused of lacking seriousness, but Bush has
and the display of party unity at the Republican Convention in
Philadelphia last week, in addition to his well-received final
speech, suggests that, at the least, he has become a formidable
party manager and campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   These two have now been joined by two of the more respected
politicians in the country _ Dick Cheney, the secretary of defense
during the Gulf war, and Lieberman, the nearest thing the Senate
has to a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The policy differences between the two sides have also begun to
sharpen. On Social Security (the pensions system), Bush has
proposed letting people take a share of their payroll taxes _
probably two percentage points out of the current 12.4 percent _
and invest it in personal retirement accounts. This is the
so-called ``partial privatization of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also wants to encourage private saving for retirement. But
he does so by proposing a federal savings subsidy, directed at
poorer savers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Bush would change the structure of the system
up front, while Gore would erode people's dependence on Social
Security by encouraging additional savings and, possibly, make
structural changes later.
</P>
<P>
   There is a comparable difference in education and health care.
Gore wants to increase spending on public education by up to four
times as much as Bush does. But Bush would try to transform the
system itself by allowing some parents to divert the money that now
goes into their children's public education towards private
schools, providing a measure of competition.
</P>
<P>
   On health, Gore wants to expand Medicaid (the system for poor
Americans) to some who do not now get it, and expand Medicare (for
the elderly) to cover the cost of more prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to reform Medicare by allowing people to buy
different levels of health care, and would provide the prescription
drug benefit through private insurers, not the government.
</P>
<P>
   None of this compares with the sort of ideological choice that
Ronald Reagan presented to Americans in 1980. But the differences
are sharp enough, and if you add in the tax cuts the two are
proposing ($1.3 trillion over ten years for Bush, $500 billion for
Gore, including the savings subsidy), it is hard to argue that it
would make little difference whom the voters decide to pick.
</P>
<P>
   Despite which, the attitudes of those voters have not changed
much. Influenced partly by satisfaction with the economy and partly
by a sense that politicians have had little to do with their
prosperity, voters remain unmoved by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hours of television watched and broadcast for the
Republican Convention was the lowest since TV became a mass medium.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of voters who say they are not following the
campaign continues to rise (44 percent now compared with 37 percent
in July 1996). Still, the twists and turns of the election do seem
to be having an impact on those who are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead in the polls leapt after last week's Republican
Convention in Philadelphia by an average of six points to around
14. That lead immediately shrank to within the margin of error in
one poll taken the day Gore chose his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The moral may be not that voters are entirely indifferent, but
that their involvement is mild and changeable. This in turn is
determining campaign strategy. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900, OR CONTINUE TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No one could fairly accuse the Republicans of offering a vacuous
set of policies. But politically, the main impact of their
proposals has not been to focus voters' attention on the issues but
rather to minimize the perception (which still exists) that Bush is
a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican interest lies in keeping attention away from
policy matters and on to the contrast of personality, where Bush
outscores Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, of course, have the opposite interest. And that
is where the election now stands _ with voters roughly evenly
divided between an unfocused satisfaction which probably favors
Bush and a fitful interest in the issues which Democrats believe
favors Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It is a start. &QL;

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Watkins Park, with its meandering stream and its
thicket of greenery, is as bucolic as downtown Indianapolis gets.
But look a little more closely _ or inhale a little more deeply _
and reality intrudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, look at that crap!'' shouts Tom Neltner. As an
activist environmentalist, he knows whereof he speaks, and there it
is: raw sewage, as well as condoms, clearly visible in the stream.
``Floatables'' is the official euphemism for them. ``Sinkables''?
Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   The mess is not just unsightly; unwary trespassers can pick up
E. Coli, or contract shigellosis and hepatitis, by dabbling in the
babbling brook. But warning signs have clearly been ignored.
Hanging from a nearby tree is a bobber connected to a fishing line.
</P>
<P>
   This rustic scene comes courtesy of Indianapolis's ``combined
sewer overflow'' (or CSO) system, which was designed nearly a
century ago to carry both sewage and storm water through one set of
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis's pipes have now become so overfilled and
undermended that they regularly carry sewage where it is not
supposed to go _ to Watkins Park or, worse, into people's
basements.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis is not the only city grappling with CSO problems.
In the 1970s and 1980s, some places used federal grants to convert
their old systems, but about 1,000 American cities, predominantly
in the Midwest and the Northwest, still have them.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, where environmental law-enforcement is often on the lax
side, accounts for about 10 percent of the communities that still
use CSOs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea did not lack logic, in the beginning. The men who built
them designed CSOs to fail once or twice a year, during unusually
big storms _ an acceptable risk, they decided, when compared with
the substantial added cost of building separate flow systems.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, some districts of Indianapolis get 85 overflows
annually, or 1.8 million gallons of diluted crud a year. Sometimes,
rainstorms that dump a mere fraction of an inch set off an
overflow.
</P>
<P>
   CSOs serve about 10 percent of the 400-square-mile city of
Indianapolis, predominantly the downtown area and some older
districts. Wherever they exist, housing values go down, no matter
how quaint the architecture or convenient the location.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Truedell-Bell, a community leader in the Mapleton-Fall
Creek district, blames the local incidence of childhood asthma on
sulphur from backed-up sewage.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the problem is easy to explain. Rapid population
growth and heavy property development during the 20th century meant
that more and more homes were hooked up to the CSO system, pushing
pipes far past their original capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors contributed, including the (pretty universal)
preference for low taxes over big investment in things you can't
see, such as sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Could another factor _ racism _ have been involved? Critics
charge that the Republicans who generally control Unigov, the
region's unusual government combing city and county, have been more
sympathetic to affluent suburbanites than to inner-city blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Neltner's pressure group _ Improving Kids' Environment, or IKE _
filed a complaint last October with the federal Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
</P>
<P>
   IKE contends that CSO neighborhoods with large numbers of blacks
get more serious overflows than CSO districts that are mostly
white. This, IKE contends, is because, Indianapolis officials have
tried to patch up the system in the white areas first, even though
the problems were less severe.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is still looking at the issue; if it agrees with IKE,
the agency may require the city to fix the problem properly.
</P>
<P>
   Neltner, for his part, would like to see an end to new suburban
connections to the old sewer system and a program that notifies
residents when overflows are happening (in case they are not yet
aware that sewage is streaming down the street).
</P>
<P>
   He also wants a long-term plan to fix the system. The obvious
way to do so would be to separate Indianapolis's storm pipes from
its sewers. Most experts say that the cost and the physical
disruption would make this impracticable.
</P>
<P>
   But even less-costly remedies _ such as building new storage
facilities and control mechanisms that would work together to make
peak flows more manageable _ would still be pricey, though exactly
how much is the theme of spirited arguments between Republicans and
the Democratic mayor (the first Democrat to hold that post in a
generation).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that CSO improvements would cost families $150
more in sewer charges every month. Although that seems a clear
exaggeration, the new mayor's director of public works admits they
would be ``very expensive to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if you are planning to visit Indianapolis this
autumn, pack your galoshes. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ America is in the ninth year of its longest-ever
peacetime expansion, but somebody has forgotten to tell its
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   While department stores such as Nordstrom, J.C. Penney and
Federated have been fighting decline for years, and the woes of
``category killers'' such as Toys ``R'' Us are well-known, the
country's hugely successful specialty retailers are only now
hitting trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been two profit warnings from Gap, a
clothing retailer, and warnings or falling sales numbers from,
among others, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters,
Pacific Sunwear and Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers' average ``same-store'' sales growth _ for units open
a year or more _ has been falling since late last year; according
to Buckingham Research Group, growth at the end of July averaged
3.6 percent, little more than half the level in December.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers blame a variety of things, from the weather to a
slowing economy. A relatively rainy summer may, admittedly, be
holding back clothing sales. And consumer spending appears to have
dropped off from the exceptional levels of the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But June's retail sales figures, which showed a healthy
annualized increase of 8.7 percent, suggest that American shoppers
are still hitting the malls in force.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, in truth, is not demand but supply. The fat
years of the recent past have tempted store groups into
over-ambitious expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Julian of Credit Suisse First Boston points out that
America now has ten times more square footage of retail space per
head than does Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are ``ignoring any notion of overcapacity,'' he says.
Clothing chains such as Gap are particularly guilty, because their
small stores are quick to build and tempt with the fattest returns.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Slater of Lazard Freres thinks that the supply of specialty
clothing space is already outstripping consumer demand, and that
the gap will grow. He calculates that growth in square footage at
American clothing chains will accelerate to 9-10 percent for this
year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Gap and American Eagle all plan to increase
floor space by two to three times that rate this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, many of these expansion plans might seem sensible
_ after all, even the seemingly omnipresent Gap has just 6 percent
of the country's clothing market. Combined, however, they are
threatening to saturate Main Street. And, as Slater points out, too
much supply will force discounting to clear excess stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a business such as retailing, with high fixed costs,
discounting spells death for profit margins. In addition, the
retailers face increasing competition, both foreign and domestic.
</P>
<P>
   While Gap has for years successfully expanded abroad, foreign
chains such as Sweden's Hennes &AMP; Mauritz and Spain's Zara have now
established a foothold in New York and plan a nationwide expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, domestic discounters, such as Costco, Kmart and above
all Wal-Mart, are continuing to take market share. Their same-store
sales growth has remained stable at around 6 percent in the past
six months, while growth at specialty clothes stores fell to just
over 1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the industry ramped up capacity too quickly, in
the early 1990s, the result was a wave of bankruptcies that led to
a decline in overall store space in 1995 and 1996, before growth
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious solution, therefore, would seem to be for the
companies to rein in their expansion plans before they get into a
similar mess. But it may take longer to remove supply from the
market this time: most of the current growth is being driven by big
branded retailers, armed with balance sheets that are stronger
today than they were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will any company want to be the first to blink. Tellingly,
Gap remains committed to its growth plans despite a sharp drop in
its share price since its latest warning.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, retailers are hoping that consumers will shop them
out of trouble. And once again, they are likely to be
disappointed. &QL;

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ Not for nothing does Buenos Aires claim to have
more psychoanalysts per square kilometer than any other city in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   For Argentines are a mercurial people: notoriously immodest
about their country's virtues, they can as easily switch to
exaggerated excoriation of its faults.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the national mood is one of deep depression,
manifested in recent days in an outpouring of anguished
self-analysis over the suicide of a well-known surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Favaloro pioneered heart-bypass surgery when working in the
United States in the 1960s. Back in Buenos Aires, he set up a
medical research center and became one of Argentina's most
respected public figures.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29th, Dr. Favaloro shot himself, seemingly because of
his medical institute's financial problems. That struck a
particular chord with Argentina's middle classes, who seem to see
in the doctor's suicide an echo of their own frustration over the
country's depressed economy.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of despair goes wider: a million or more flocked this
week to the shrine of San Cayetano, patron saint of labor, praying
for his help to find work.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is suffering some of the textbook symptoms of
deflation. The economy went into recession almost two years ago,
battered by emerging-market blues and the problems of Brazil, its
main trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Brazil, whose economy is now growing strongly again,
Argentina cannot shake off recession by devaluing its currency: its
peso is fixed by law at parity with the dollar under its rigid
currency-board scheme.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando de la Rua's government has instead tried to
woo the financial markets by trimming the fiscal deficit it
inherited when taking office in December, through tax rises and
spending cuts, including a cut in civil servants' wages.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery has been sluggish. Growth is confined to
exports; consumer spending continues to fall, in part because of
the tax rises and wage cuts for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Though lower than its peak in the last recession in 1995,
unemployment is still rising. It stood at 15.4 percent in May, up
from 13.8 percent last October. Officials still claim doggedly that
the economy will grow by 3 percent this year, but most
private-sector economists think 1-2 percent more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revenues in July were disappointing, after the previous
month's bumper take had temporarily improved confidence. Investors
have started to worry that the government may not manage to meet
the fiscal targets for the rest of the year that it has negotiated
with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an economic team that makes such a big deal out of country
risk and investors' expectations, that would be a tremendous
setback,'' says Pedro Lacoste of Alfa, an economic think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of several economists who argue that de la Rua's team
should have taken even tougher action when it came to office in
December, cutting instead of raising taxes and forcing privatized
utility operators to slash their tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the public-sector wage cuts, that would have added
up to ``a once-off deflationary shock,'' of equivalent effect to a
devaluation, says Lacoste.
</P>
<P>
   Officials counter that the worst is over, and that patience will
be rewarded. Few Argentines are prepared to contemplate abandoning
their currency board: many retain traumatic memories of the
hyperinflation that preceded it. But deflation carries
psychological scars too.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Argentina's psychoanalysts should face no problems
finding work in the coming months. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Following the explosive growth of Internet
stockbroking in America in 1996-99, it was natural that American
online brokers would start expanding into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Natural, too, that their eyes should alight first on good old
Britain: English-speaking, Internet-hip and, since the
privatizations of the 1980s, home to a broad-based ``shareholder
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Britain is proving slower to embrace online investing than
are continental countries, supposedly so much more leery of the
American way of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now behind a number of places _ notably Germany _ in
the number of online share-dealing accounts. Some of the American
brokers who plumped for Britain as their stepping-stone to Europe
must be wondering if they made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report by J.P. Morgan, an investment bank,
Britain has one-third of Europe's shareholders but only 7 percent
of the continent's online-broking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It cites a number of reasons for this, including the low savings
rate in Britain (4 percent of disposable income as opposed to 12-13
percent in most of Europe). And young Britons, who might be
expected to use the Internet if they started investing in shares,
tend to invest so much money in their homes that they have little
left for the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, by contrast, equity investment is taking off at the
same time as the Internet. Online broking has been further boosted
by the splurge of companies listing on Frankfurt's
technology-dominated Neuer Markt.
</P>
<P>
   But Huw van Steenis, the report's author, thinks the most
important reason for Britain's relatively slow switch to online
investing is ``the arcane and expensive clearing and settlement
system.'' The costs include the government's ``stamp duty'' tax of
0.5 percent levied on all share purchases.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the reliance on bits of paper. Some
three-quarters or more of all retail share-deals in Britain are
settled by the transfer of physical share-certificates rather than
electronically, through nominee accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certificated'' trading is a cumbersome, expensive service that
few online brokers offer. Many investors became accustomed and
attached to certificated trading during the privatization boom of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Blanket advertising campaigns urged the masses to ``tell Sid''
to buy shares in state-owned utilities. Sid ended up with a lot of
paper, and more when a number of building societies (thrifts)
shifted from mutual to shareholder ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the stock exchange has switched to
``dematerialized,'' book-entry share-ownership, which new buyers of
shares accept but Sid dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   The transition will take time. Too bad for Britain's online
brokers. Three of the top five are American: TD Waterhouse, DLJ
and, biggest of all, Charles Schwab, which now claims more than
half of British online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Did they make a mistake in locating their European bases in
Britain? Of course, none will admit as much. Indeed, they point out
that, having doubled in six months, the British market for online
transactions is expanding at a phenomenal rate.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Duste, chief executive of Charles Schwab Europe, does
concede that, with hindsight, his firm might have concentrated
harder on other markets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He is also disappointed that it is proving harder than expected
to develop cross-border business within the European Union, despite
the EU's attempts to create a pan-European market in the securities
business.
</P>
<P>
   No American firm has a big share of any continental European
market. Nor, with the partial exceptions of ConSors, of Germany,
and Bipop, from Italy, have European brokers had much success
outside their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, outside Britain, it is striking how much local firms
dominate their national markets. So for Americans, in one respect
at least, it is still good old Britain. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ ``Dear Tony,'' begins the earnest memo from one
policy wonk to another. ``Knowing our shared interest in global
climate change, I have enclosed a report on the benefits of
greenhouse gas emissions trading...
</P>
<P>
   ``This new report by the nonprofit Pew Center on Global Climate
Change supports the view that a flexible, well-designed trading
system will significantly reduce the costs of climate change
mitigation...With best regards, Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The casual snoop might pass over this epistle as merely the
unremarkable ramblings of an academic or bureaucrat. Inspect more
closely, though, and two surprises emerge.
</P>
<P>
   First, this letter, penned recently by one Bill Clinton to one
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, is about an issue both take
seriously: global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the letter reveals just how influential Eileen Claussen,
the head of the Pew Center, has now become. Why does she have the
ear of the world's most powerful man? The answer is that she knows
how to dance circles around the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three years ago, in the run-up to the signing of
the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the debate in America
on climate change was dominated by skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto pact was seen in many countries as a courageous if
imperfect attempt to come to grips with an impossibly complex and
uncertain threat. In the United States, however, it was regarded
with scorn by those who sought to portray it as the handiwork of
wild-eyed greens such as the vice president, Al Gore, who had
helped to broker the Kyoto deal.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the opposition was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC),
an umbrella group representing heavy industry. Through television
campaigns and intense lobbying, company executives sought not
merely to sink the Kyoto treaty, but to trash the very notion of
climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Such hostility was a sharp contrast with the more open attitudes
of big business in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Even when faced with new scientific evidence of the human role
in climate change, the GCC remained combative.
</P>
<P>
   The picture has changed dramatically in the past two years.
Giant firms such as United Technologies, Intel, American Electric
Power (AEP), DuPont and BP now openly accept that the evidence for
climate change is sufficient to take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, as a new report issued last week by the Pew Center
points out, are conducting audits of the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted by their plants and are taking on voluntary targets for
emissions cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms even think reducing emissions could be profitable.
Frank Loy, America's top negotiator on climate change, says that
big firms have ``shifted from being climate skeptics to climate
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives much of the credit for this volte face to Claussen.
Until the Pew Center began to challenge its line roughly two years
ago, the GCC had a virtual monopoly as the public face of corporate
America in the climate debate.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, a longtime bureaucrat who had often dealt with
corporations during international environmental talks, suspected
that attitudes in big business were not quite so uniform.
</P>
<P>
   After she resigned from government in mid-1997, she crafted a
set of principles that reflected a more progressive approach to
climate change, but which ``danced a fine line on Kyoto,'' as one
person on the receiving end of her pitch describes it.
</P>
<P>
   With some trepidation, she approached a handful of leading
American industrial firms that she thought might be open-minded.
She was right. A number of companies agreed to band together under
the Pew Center's umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for the early joiners: some, such as AEP, a big
coal-fired utility, and BP, a giant oil firm, were berated by their
peers for breaking ranks. However, the Pew's media skills meant
that they soon found strength in numbers and a powerful voice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the GCC is a spent force, while the Pew's blue-chip
member companies have annual sales of more than $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is no suprise, then, that Claussen has detractors. One charge
is that the Pew Center is a front for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen insists this is nonsense. She points out that she has
been highly critical of the administration, both for its lack of
domestic action and for its ``dangerous'' efforts overseas to
dilute the Kyoto pact.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she notes, she served under Presidents George Bush and
Ronald Reagan with distinction, and counts leading Republicans as
fans. She even chides Gore for ``lacking courage'' to push ahead
with the issue of which he was an early champion.
</P>
<P>
   Another, more substantive, grouse is that Claussen is a
shameless publicity hound. The boss of a respected think-tank
points to the huge sums that the Pew Center spends on full-color
advertisements and glossy brochures, and mutters that he could have
used that money for serious research projects.
</P>
<P>
   On this count, Claussen is probably guilty as charged. But do
not expect any remorse, as her use of the media has been by far her
most powerful weapon.
</P>
<P>
   By spending pots of money on ads, brochures, independent reports
and high-profile conferences, the Pew Center has managed to earn
credibility as an honest broker. Where moderate firms once kept
silent, they now have a forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, only the bad guys were out there in the media,''
says Claussen. ``We raised the ante by being so public.'' That is
the sort of spin of which both Tony and Bill would surely be
proud. &QL;

 BY ANN QUIGLEY

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Florsheim says its magnet-laden shoes can ease pain and make
your legs and back less tired. But a California consumer group is
not just taking issue with these claims; it is suing the company
for touting them as remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Justice Center, a nonprofit consumer protection
group, filed the suit last week in Orange County and asks that
Florsheim stop advertising the MagneForce shoes as a health aid and
refund the purchase price (about $122 plus tax) to people who
bought the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Karen McKenzie, a spokeswoman for Florsheim Group, Inc., in
Chicago said the company could not comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Any health claims for magnetic shoes is ``a commercial fairy
tale,'' says Dr. Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist in
Allentown, Pa., and operator of Quackwatch, Inc., a nonprofit
watchdog organization that alerts the public to health-related
frauds, myths and fads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claims that magnets affect the body's magnetic fields is
utter nonsense,'' he says. ``The magnets in shoes _ similar to
refrigerator magnets _ are too weak to produce any measurable
effect within the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett was a consultant to the Consumer Justice Center's legal
action.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is not clear-cut, and some mainstream doctors are
finding that magnets are not as easily dismissed as pain relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the suit: MagneForce shoes ``generate a
deep-penetrating magnetic field which increases circulation;
reduces foot, leg and back fatigue; provides natural pain relief
and improved energy level,'' the company says on its Web site, a
claim also cited in the suit. Other health claims cited in the
lawsuit _ for example, one regarding benefits to circulation _ have
been removed from Florsheim's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient folk remedy, magnets have become a $5-billion-a-year
worldwide industry, according to Dr. Edward Collacott, department
head for physical medicine and rehabilitation with the Northern
Arizona Veterans Affairs health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Popular in Asia, touted by sports figures and sewn into women's
corsets and offered in early Sears Roebuck catalogs, magnetic
devices today come in all shapes and sizes _ from $25 bracelets to
mattress pads costing $400.
</P>
<P>
   Florsheim introduced magnets into the insoles of Florsheim
MagneForce golf shoes in 1999 and golfers who wore them said the
shoes helped. The shoemaker worked with Magnetherapy Inc., the
makers of magnetic therapy to produce its MagneForce line.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett says that Magnetherapy ``has been warned by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to stop claiming that its products
would relieve arthritis, tennis elbow, low-back-pain sciatica,
migraine headache, muscle soreness, spurs, bunions arthritic
fingers and toes or could reduce pain and inflammation.'' In 1998,
Magnetherapy paid a $30,000 penalty and agreed to stop making
health claims for its magnetic products, according to the Texas
attorney general, where the penalty was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Florsheim says the success of the golf shoes spurred the company
into introducing magnets into dress and casual shoes in June of
this year. According to the company's Web site earlier last week,
the magnets generate a field that ``penetrates the foot to a depth
of two inches. Studies indicate that magnetic fields increase blood
circulation, bring natural pain relief and increase range of
motion, leading to an increased level of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett dismisses any endorsement by golfers. ``Lots of athletes
swear that doing one thing or another has improved their health or
their performance. I am not aware of any published scientific study
demonstrating that golfers who wore magnetic shoes improved their
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jury could still be out on magnets, according to Dr.
Michael Weintraub, chief of neurology at Phelps Memorial Medical
Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. He began a study of magnets in 1995,
using a ``skeptical approach.'' People who were in pain who had
back surgery because of ``failed back syndrome,'' as well as those
with ``peripheral neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome,'' were
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Peripheral neuropathy is a common disorder that comes from
damage to certain nerves, according to the National Institutes of
Health. It may be caused by diseases of the nerves or as the result
of illnesses such as diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub used people whose problems stemmed from diabetes. ``I
was surprised. These people got significant relief _ a 75 percent
response rate in the diabetic group and a 50 percent response rate
in the nondiabetic group.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the earlier studies have prompted a national
study of the effects of magnets for diabetics, for those with back
pain and for carpal tunnel syndrome, Weintraub says.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The search for the next Microsoft is an
understandable obsession. But although this week's $6.4-billion
merger between two of Silicon Valley's highest-flying software
communications firms, Phone.com and Software.com, inevitably
prompted such talk, the reality is that Phone.com already looks
rather more like the next Netscape _ Microsoft's erstwhile victim.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal was predictably described by the participants
as the creation of a new ``global powerhouse,'' the combined annual
revenues of the two companies are only around $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   And though Software.com is a solid business, and is even making
a small profit, Phone.com has faced a sufficiently uncertain future
to be regarded by most analysts as a takeover candidate. It must
hope that throwing in its lot with a firm of similar size will
change that.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news for shareholders was that the merging
firms have lured a top manager from the mighty Cisco Systems, Don
Listwin, to run the business.
</P>
<P>
   To walk away from the possibility of succeeding John Chambers,
Cisco's boss, in five years' time, not to mention a bundle of Cisco
options, is quite a declaration of faith.
</P>
<P>
   As a linchpin of the mobile Internet, Phone.com was one of the
past year's hottest stocks, rising by 1,200 percent from its IPO in
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that the mobile phone will quickly
overtake the personal computer as the means by which most people
gain access to online services. And as the pioneer of much of the
software infrastructure that is making all this happen, Phone.com
seemed to be sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's founder, Alain Rossmann, a veteran of Apple, had been
determined not to repeat the mistakes made by his former company.
</P>
<P>
   When Phone.com (then called Unwired Planet) came up with the
technology for a mobile browser, Rossmann, rather than go it alone,
approached the mobile-phone-making giants _ Nokia, Ericsson and
Motorola _ in 1997 to persuade them that it should become the
standard for wireless Internet communication.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, and the technology became known as WAP (wireless
application protocol). It was the breakthrough that Rossmann's
fledgling company needed, but it came at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Although Unwired Planet had a technological lead over
mobile-phone firms and software rivals, WAP was to be an open
standard rather than a proprietary one (like Microsoft's Windows).
</P>
<P>
   Today, around 80 percent of all WAP telephones have Phone.com
browsers, but Nokia is already using a version of its own and
Ericsson plans to offer a mobile edition of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer next year.
</P>
<P>
   Phone.com is probably resigned to seeing its share of the WAP
browser market decline. But, as it more or less gives its browsers
away, it could live with that as long as there is strong demand
from big telecoms firms for its server software for the mobile
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft, Oracle and others are greedily contemplating
that market. Phone.com will need to take full advantage of its
superior focus and nimbleness if it is to stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Software.com is less glamorous than Phone.com, but has been just
as much a leader in its field.
</P>
<P>
   By selling Internet messaging infrastructure to telephone
companies and Internet service providers, it has quickly built up a
base of around 120 million users. Its software brings together
e-mail, voice mail, messaging and even video into one unified
Web-based service.
</P>
<P>
   Software.com faces stiff competition too, but has looked less
vulnerable than its new partner.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet mailbox companies offer similar products
aimed at consumers and small businesses, while Microsoft will
defend its dominant Exchange program from insurgents by
incorporating it into its .NET web-services strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Software.com's range of products can expand and
still remain competitive, the big communications companies it
serves are unlikely to desert it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the merger will create a ``powerhouse'' is debatable,
but it should bring some benefits. It will stop both firms from
competing expensively against one another, as they did within a few
weeks of each other earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Phone.com paid $850 million for a unified messaging start-up
called Onebox.com and Software.com bought (at) &LR; mobile.com, a
wireless-application service provider, for over $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   With customers and product lines that are complementary, there
should also be plenty of scope for cross-selling. And, by creating
a single platform across both the fixed-line and wireless Internet,
the new entity should be better placed to fend off rivals that have
only one part of the jigsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Much, though, will depend on Listwin. He will bring with him
from Cisco both a high level of credibility with large telephone
companies and an unrelenting focus on customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   If he can also pull together two talented but very different
developer teams, he may succeed in forging a company that is at
least capable of competing with Microsoft, if not rivalling it. &QL;

<P>
   MUMBAI _ Subhash Ghai is all smiles these days _ and with good
reason. Mukta Arts, his movie production company, has just closed
the first-ever public offering of shares by a big firm from
Bollywood, the name for the Hindi movie industry located around
Mumbai (Bombay).
</P>
<P>
   As investors pore over the volatile cash flows of his firm, Ghai
is fired by the idea of building a Hollywood-style studio that
hires and trains Indian movie directors, writers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Bollywood, he says, must get corporate. Producers such as Ghai
sense a big opportunity in India's movie industry, which currently
turns over a modest 60 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) a year _ if
only it can mend its unruly ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 films are made in India each year, more than in any
other country. Bollywood contributes roughly a quarter of that
number. The rest comes from a thriving but dispersed regional movie
industry, mostly in the south, in languages such as Tamil and
Telugu.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled by a few powerful movie producers _ often tycoons or
former actors _ the industry is largely self-financed, but at a
high cost. Private finance, some of it from underworld sources, is
secured at usurious rates of between 24 percent and 36 percent.
Small wonder that only a fifth of all movies make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The money-making opportunities are increasing, however, with the
boom in satellite television in India and the global market for
Indian movies. More than 60 satellite-television channels in India
have enlarged the appetite for local films and film music.
</P>
<P>
   Television production houses, such as Sony Entertainment and
Star TV, pay huge sums to buy the rights of Bollywood favorites.
Ghai has already covered half the costs of his next movie by
selling the music rights for 60 million rupees.
</P>
<P>
   Even bigger returns flow from the growing foreign market for
Indian films. Revenues from movie exports have almost doubled in
the past two years. The cost of making an Indian movie can now be
covered from the overseas distribution rights alone.
</P>
<P>
   New and unlikely markets have opened up: the colorful
song-and-dance routines of ``Taal'' (Rhythm), Ghai's
biggest-grossing movie, attracted large audiences in Japan last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hollywood studios have started to distribute Indian
movies in a small way, although they have yet to venture into
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollar Dreams,'' based on stories of the cross-cultural angst
of expatriate Indians returning home, is being distributed by
Twentieth Century Fox; Sony Pictures distributed its first Hindi
movie last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some optimists even see India as a low-cost producer for the
global movie industry. Film City, a newly expanded 2,000-acre
complex on the outskirts of Hyderabad, offers 40 studio floors and
sophisticated post-production facilities; it has already attracted
a handful of movie-makers from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, India's growing prowess in information technology is
helping software firms such as Pentamedia to break into the
$16-billion global film-animation market.
</P>
<P>
   Crest Communications, a Mumbai-based entertainment company that
recently bought Los Angeles-based Rich Animation Studios, is
producing a 3-D animation movie for the international market.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also signed Shah Rukh Khan, one of Bollywood's
biggest stars, for an animated movie that will be co-produced with
Kellogg's, a cereal maker.
</P>
<P>
   However, big investors remain wary of Bollywood's reputation for
murky dealings and cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has already had its share of false dawns: a few
years ago, for instance, foreign investors poured money into a
promising entertainment venture linked to Amitabh Bachchan,
Bollywood's biggest star. It was struggling within months, and
eventually went bust.
</P>
<P>
   Those brave enough to back Ghai's stock market foray can only
hope that this time things really will be different. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Grapevines, being clones (they are propagated as
cuttings), are extremely susceptible to disease. Once a bacterium
has worked out how to get past a clone's defenses, it can run riot.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle differences of response to infection that are found
in genetically diverse host organisms, and which serve to slow
pathogens down, are absent in cloned crops.
</P>
<P>
   That is why California's viticulturists are so worried about
Pierce's disease. It has ravaged the state's vineyards twice in the
past _ once in the 1880s, and once in the 1930s and 1940s. Now, to
the horror of wine lovers everywhere, it is threatening to do so
again.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's disease is caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium
that infects the tissue which carries water from a plant's roots to
its leaves, and whose genome was unravelled by researchers in
Brazil earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the insect mainly responsible for spreading
Xylella in California was a leafhopper called the blue-green
sharpshooter. This bug usually feeds at the edges of vineyards, and
then only on tender new shoots. That makes it easy for farmers to
prune away the infected portions of a vine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, however, a new Xylella vector _ the glassy-winged
sharpshooter _ appeared in California. This bug confines itself
neither to the edges of vineyards, nor to the tenderest shoots. It
will feed, vinewise, on anything, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It thus spreads Xylella very fast. And it has already been
recorded in 11 of California's grape-growing counties. The state's
officials are understandably paranoid about this.
</P>
<P>
   So, like the lady who swallowed a spider to catch the fly, they
have been casting around for something that likes to eat
glassy-winged sharpshooters, preferably in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They have come up with a small Mexican wasp called Gonatocerus
triguttatus. The females of this wasp hunt out sharpshooter egg
masses and lay their own eggs there. When the wasp larvae hatch,
they eat the sharpshooter's eggs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Larry Bezark, the entomologist at California's
Department of Food and Agriculture who is in charge of the program,
experimental releases of Gonatocerus will begin this month. If all
goes well, a mass release of the critters will take place next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who enjoy a glass of chardonnay, merlot or cabernet
sauvignon should keep their fingers crossed. &QL;

LONG LIVE THE KINGS OF COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody laughs like black folks. They don't snort, they don't
giggle, they don't guffaw.
</P>
<P>
   Black folks holler.
</P>
<P>
   They scream.
</P>
<P>
   They shout.
</P>
<P>
   They double over in sweet pain, wave their hands in the air, and
stamp their feet. Brothas get up out of their seats and got to walk
with it for a spell. Sistahs clap their hands wildly and whoop it
up like their mamas didn't teach them anything about acting right
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody laughs like black folks, and nobody enjoys laughing more,
which probably explains why ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' became
the highest-grossing comedy tour of all time. Playing to
predominantly African-American audiences, the tour featured Steve
Harvey, D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac _ all
African-American, and all among the best comedians working today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most Americans never heard of the tour or its stars, though
they sold out more than 90 dates, garnering $37 million. It was a
black thing, and white America just couldn't _ or wouldn't _
understand.
</P>
<P>
   All that may change Friday, when ``The Original Kings of
Comedy'' opens in theaters. Directed by Spike Lee, the film
documents the tour's stop in Charlotte, N.C., where the comedians
tore the roof off the Coliseum joking about everything from what
would have happened if black people had been on the Titanic to
smoking a cigarette for maximum cool to old-school soul vs.
hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is for everybody; laughter is universal,'' said
Cedric during a recent phone interview from Chicago. ``We are four
black men speaking from a certain perspective, but there's a lot of
comedy there that everyone can enjoy. And we definitely don't
discriminate when it comes to ticket buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Good comedy, after all, isn't black or white. It's just funny.
And these self-proclaimed Kings sling the kind of deep down
gut-bucket humor we haven't enjoyed since Richard Pryor was riffing
on his heart attack, and on the differences between white and black
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   So how come so much of America never caught the Kings' act?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the radar
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It just remained under the radar of mainstream America because
mainstream media didn't think it was important or significant,''
said Harvey during a break from taping the fifth season of his WB
comedy, ``The Steve Harvey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they obviously didn't consider the four guys who were
doing it newsworthy,'' he said. ``If Jerry Seinfeld, Tim Allen, and
Drew Carey were doing these numbers, they would have been on the
cover of Time and Entertainment Weekly. But that's the country we
live in. They can ignore a lot of stuff when it isn't coming from
the right demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it became a little blatant that they didn't want
to recognize it,'' said Cedric, who appeared in this summer's hit
Martin Lawrence comedy, ``Big Momma's House.'' ``I didn't relate it
all to racism as much as to the fact that we advertised on black
radio, we advertised to the black market, so we didn't necessarily
invite them to the party, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' tour was the brainchild of
Walter Latham. After years of promoting comedy acts in small clubs,
he saw an opportunity in 1997 to fill arenas if he could corral the
services of top comedians _ and Harvey, Cedric, and Mac were the
biggest names on the circuit. By 1998, Hughley, best known as the
star of ``The Hughleys'' (once ABC's show, now UPN's), joined the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where they're coming from
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Cedric and Hughley are former hosts of BET's ``Comic
View,'' and most of the comedians have appeared on HBO's ``Def
Comedy Jam.'' Their influences range from Pryor and Jackie ``Moms''
Mabley to Robin Harris and their own relatives. Each comedian
brings a ribald, but different, style to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley has a rapid-fire wit, and can ad-lib like nobody's
business, especially when he uses the audience as fodder. Mac is
the most raw, the most profane. He's the one dropping endless
N-bombs, anti-gay epithets, and a certain B-word that would have
gotten him jacked up back in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie has taken some flak with this movie because of his
material on kids and gays, but what he says is very funny,'' Harvey
said. ``He happens to say what a lot of people think, so I'm not
mad at Bernie at all. Bernie is the comedian we all can't be
because he'll say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while they may admire Mac, both Cedric and Harvey draw the
line when it comes to certain topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one to talk about sexually overt things I'm not trying
to tell you how I have sex, what I do to a woman,'' said Cedric,
who co-stars in ``The Steve Harvey Show.'' ``I'm not trying to
defame or attack people. I try to have fun on stage, therefore
there's never anything in my material where I'm trying to go out
and hurt people's feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey won't use the N-word, or the B-word. He steers clear of
``anything defaming God,'' and he won't do ``sex humor. My body
part, your body part _ that's not my thing. There's enough guys out
there doing that. I'm 43, and I have a lot of experiences to draw
on so I don't have to talk about sexuality all day.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tolerance factor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that the audiences seem to mind. But years on the comedy
circuit have taught Harvey the differences between white and black
concertgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people have a higher tolerance level for comedy. Black
people have the ability to laugh at hardship much quicker than
mainstream America,'' Harvey said. ``But that's because most of us
come from a background with hardship. So we can laugh at more
difficult subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that other little thing, something anyone who
has ever watched ``Showtime at the Apollo'' (on which Harvey is the
host) can tell you all about: Black audiences are the toughest
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``White audiences are a little more forgiving, in terms of being
more polite toward you,'' Harvey said. ``Black audiences tally up
the ticket price, how much it cost to park, how much the outfit
that they wore cost, their haircut, the two drinks in the lobby,
the babysitter _ and then come to the conclusion that they spent
$300, and now you got to be way funnier than the $40 ticket
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Although all of the comedians have found success away from the
circuit, stand-up comedy remains their first love. Mac tours 40
weeks a year, and Harvey, Cedric and Hughley perform even when
their TV shows are in production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love live performance because it's the purest form,'' Cedric
said. ``You're the commentator, the material is written by you, it
comes from your perspective. It's where you can have the most
freedom to say what you really want to say. When you play a movie
role or a TV role, people start to see you as that character.
Stand-up gives you the freedom to be away from all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the things Harvey most enjoys about stand-up,
which he calls his ``God-given gift, the one thing I will never
forsake.'' But audiences familiar with him through his TV role as
mild-mannered vice-principal Steve Hightower are always surprised
by his live performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the top I say, `By round of applause, how many of
you are seeing me live for the first time?' Then when I get that
applause, I say, `OK, there's some adjustments you need to make.
Mr. Hightower is not here; the real Steve Harvey is here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The comedians are in discussions to resume their tour, perhaps
later this year. But first they hope the film will open their brand
of comedy, with all of its African-American sensibilities intact,
to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   `With a movie like this, it's also a learning experience. You
get to learn through laughter,'' Cedric said. ``You get to see the
differences in how we see something. I'm just telling you my point
of view. For black people, it's a real laugh, but I think white
audiences can laugh _ and learn _ as well.''

<P>
   For years, tourists visiting Los Angeles have bypassed Los
Angeles itself. Or at least its core.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing excursions generally have been confined to
attractions on the outskirts of the city: Disneyland, Hollywood,
the beach, Beverly Hills, Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown district? No, thanks. It might have been the center
of commerce for the nation's second-largest city _ and presented a
pleasing skyline for those passing through at a comfortable
distance _ but there was otherwise little to recommend it. It was
grimy and about as inviting as a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, downtown has enjoyed quite a renaissance. And
just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to this week's Democratic National Convention will find
that they won't have to stray too far from the Staples Center or
their downtown hotels to enjoy a few minutes of tourist indulgence.
When a speech is dragging or a floor vote is delayed or a protest
demonstration is proving to be a nuisance, they will find ample
options for sightseeing right here _ within a few blocks, or at
most a few miles.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no reason the conventioneers should have these
attractions all to themselves. Southern California residents who
haven't kept up with the changes downtown might want to get
reacquainted with the city, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of all, here are 10 gems for Dems (and the rest of
us) _ including just a couple of reliable chestnuts on the fringe
of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   1. Music Center
</P>
<P>
   It was Woody Allen who said that Los Angeles' sole cultural
contribution was a right turn on a red light, but on a drive up
Figueroa from the Staples Center, you'll only make one such turn en
route to this impressive complex of three performing arts venues.
(It takes up a city block bounded by Grand, First, Temple and
Hope.)
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous but elegant Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The
intimate Mark Taper Forum. The recently renovated Ahmanson Theatre.
Even if you can't free up time for one of the programs here, the
Music Center, which is situated on some of downtown's highest
ground, is still an intriguing place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, its plaza is popular with brown-baggers from
nearby skyscrapers and court buildings, and Jacques Lipchitz's
syncopated fountain, ``Peace on Earth,'' can make even a searing
August day seem a trifle cooler. Young people in particular squeal
in delight as they try to time the fountain's irregular rhythms and
dash through in its brief, teasing instances of dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Free tours are conducted of the complex, usually around midday
during the week (11:30 a.m., noon, 1 p.m.); they form at the
entrance to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a production of ``Finian's Rainbow'' fell through at
the Ahmanson, but it might be L.A.'s gain. The replacement show is
``The Dead,'' the Tony Award-winning musical based on the James
Joyce short story. It might seem odd timing _ the story is set in
Dublin at Christmastime _ but we've never taken ourselves too
seriously when it comes to culture in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   At the Taper is ``Expecting Isabel,'' a comedy about how the
decision to have a baby can throw a monkey wrench into the marriage
of 30-somethings. (Imagine that.) The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
meanwhile, will be dark this week _ the Philharmonic is busy at the
Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Museum of Contemporary Art
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are all black and white. And universally
sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Two such exhibits are running concurrently at MOCA, half a block
south of the Music Center (at 250 S. Grand Ave.). The most
compelling is surely ``The Social Scene,'' an exhibition that is in
its final week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the museum's permanent collection (but not always on
display), ``The Social Scene'' is a look at America from the 1930s
to the '70s through the lenses of nine notable photographers. It's
a frank, unblinking and often ironic gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frank focuses on small-town and rural life from the '50s
and '60s, allowing us to peer in at scenes in coffee shops, public
parks, barber shops, African-American funerals. Diane Arbus offers
fascinating character studies.
</P>
<P>
   And Garry Winogrand, once you get past his shots of young women
that border on voyeurism, provides views of subjects that should be
dear to conventioneers' hearts: anti-war and abortion-rights
rallies. Our convention visitors might want to skip his ``Nixon
Victory Celebration'' from 1972, but neither should they fret _
seems he skipped their infamous get-together in Chicago in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibit that just opened is ``John Gutmann: Culture
Shock.'' He was a Jew in Germany in the 1930s before fleeing to San
Francisco, and on display here is the photographer's documentary
work, mostly shot in America.
</P>
<P>
   3. Grand Central Market/Angels Flight
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Bunker Hill from MOCA is a downtown
treasure that dates to 1917 _ a vast public market where visitors
can celebrate cultural diversity ... with a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Your appetite is likely to be activated the instant you step
through its warehouse-like doors and begin breathing in a rich
convergence of cooking aromas. (The market is bordered by Hill,
Broadway, Third and Fourth). You'll find L.A.'s full ethnic mix at
the casual food stands here: Chinese, Salvadoran, Thai and, of
course, a generous complement of Mexican outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The food at L.A.'s suburban Mexican restaurants tends to be
toned down for the gringos, but you'll find fare here so authentic
that you might not recognize some of the featured items, you could
have trouble comprehending the English of the counter man, and
you're likely to need that extra napkin to wipe your eyes during
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lively, vibrant place, with a light dusting of sawdust on
the concrete floor, and even if you're not hungry, it's fun just to
stroll and gaze through the display windows. You'll find produce,
flowers, ice cream, booze, bread, health food, delis (they still
make luncheon loaf?), a fish market and a giant machine that cranks
out fresh tortillas at Chapalita Tortilleria.
</P>
<P>
   The place is pleasantly scruffy, but most of the food stands
seem to be displaying the county health department's highest
cleanliness rating: ``A.'' For Mexican food that shames the chains
of Southern California, you can't go wrong at Tumbras, Ana Maria,
Maria's or Roast to Go (yes, that's the actual name of the
establishment).
</P>
<P>
   To or from the market, sample another throwback to the early
1900s: the Angels Flight funicular railway, which traverses the
short but steep climb between Hill Street (catty-corner to the
market entrance) and Olive. This relic from L.A.'s past was
recently reassembled after being in storage for nearly 30 years. It
costs a whole quarter to ride it.
</P>
<P>
   4. L.A. Conservancy walking tour
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Conservancy has taken the lead in celebrating
the city's past and offers some stellar walking tours on Saturdays,
but unfortunately the organization wimped out in the face of the
convention's potential crush. The conservancy canceled all but one
of this week's tours.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. That schedule includes an examination of L.A.'s art
deco architecture, the old movie palaces along Broadway, and the
Pershing Square landmarks. Program coordinator Annie Laskey
explained that the tours meet at the Biltmore Hotel, which will
house convention honchos, and there was fear that conditions would
be too hectic.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradbury Building, included on one of the tours, is still
worth a look, though. At 304 S. Broadway, it is a Victorian wonder
whose exotic atrium features lacy black ironwork, tiers of open
stairwells, cage elevators and polished wood, all lit naturally
through a glass ceiling. When the makers of the 1982 movie ``Blade
Runner'' needed a futuristic look for L.A. in 2020, they ventured
back in time to this place.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy will, however, conduct a tour of Union Station
on Saturday, and it would be well worth the time of any
conventioneers who linger through the weekend. It explores the
architecture, art work and history of one of the last great railway
stations, an L.A. landmark that features 52-foot ceilings above
marble floors _ all now wasted on Amtrak. Laskey says reservations
for the 10 a.m. tour are a must: (213) 623-2489.
</P>
<P>
   5. Olvera Street
</P>
<P>
   This blatantly touristy site, a few steps uphill from Union
Station, is included only because it's where it all began for this
city. In the 1700s, some Spanish soldiers pitched camp in a flood
plain and came up with a name that was probably longer than their
settlement: El Rio Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles de
Porciuncula.
</P>
<P>
   A pueblo followed, and the name was edited down so that it would
fit on campaign buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Olvera Street has been conquered by the souvenir traders,
and they don't exactly stand on tradition _ framed photos of
pro-wrestling stars are offered among the sombreros and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the buildings along the plaza date to the early
1800s _ which is old for Los Angeles. Wander through the U-shaped
Avila Adobe (circa 1818), which features wood floors, open beams
and a broad, pre-air-conditioning overhang rimming the inner patio.
Find shade beneath mature olive trees. Survey grape vines that have
overtaken lines tied overhead.
</P>
<P>
   With the imagination unleashed, you might acquire a sense of
L.A. long before it represented a fourth of California's electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Little Tokyo
</P>
<P>
   This region a few blocks south of Olvera Street was beginning to
boom when its residents were shipped off to internment camps during
World War II, but it since has made an impressive comeback, all the
more so in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Its jewel is the 8-year-old Japanese American National Museum
(369 E. 1st St.). Currently among its exhibits is ``Common Ground:
The Heart of Community,'' which addresses the issues of
assimilation for this country's first Japanese immigrants and their
American-born children. It deals frankly with wartime
incarceration, and the word ``concentration'' is subbed for
``internment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other exhibits explore the athletic participation of
Japanese-Americans, notably as an assimilation vehicle in the 1920s
and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Across First Street from the museum is the Japanese Village
Plaza, whose brick walkway features waterfalls and shady trees and
is lined with sidewalk cafes and shops. You can seek out an
acupuncture treatment. Or, at Tawa's Spa, get a shiatsu massage
(steady, Mr. President).
</P>
<P>
   7. Exposition Park
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League viewed this complex as an urban war
zone when Los Angeles was seeking an expansion team recently.
Obviously, the league's billionaires hadn't visited it recently _
at least during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The area directly north of the Coliseum is emerging as a
treasure and thrives with activity most days. Among its offerings
are the California Science Center, the Natural History Museum, an
expansive rose garden and the California African American Museum.
(The California Aerospace Museum will be added to the mix when its
refurbishment is completed.) All of this lies exactly two miles
down Figueroa from the front door of the Staples Center _ don't
walk; no one in L.A. does.
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center is free ($5 donation suggested),
although there is a charge for several rides and features, and it
is proving to be a wonderland for inquisitive kids. Hear the sounds
of human digestion (right down to the belches), feel what it's like
to be in an earthquake (at least an extremely mild one), take a
high-wire bicycle ride, observe various magic acts (shoehorned into
the theme of the building under the subtext ``The Science of
Illusion'').
</P>
<P>
   The facility also features no fewer than four IMAX movies.
</P>
<P>
   The African American Museum (also free) currently has a terrific
exhibit titled ``Rhythms of the Soul,'' which is in its final week.
It displays ancient African instruments _ lutes, bow harps, bata
drums _ while also tracing black music on this continent through
calypso, blues, ragtime, jazz, be-bop and hip-hop. Put on a set of
headphones, for example, and hear a 1933 recording of Bessie Smith
singing ``Gimme a Pigfoot.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's no fun to spend all your time indoors on a sunny,
summer day. That sprawling rose garden has bushes that were planted
72 years ago, and when the breeze is up, a stroll here is like a
visit to a perfumery.
</P>
<P>
   8. Hollywood Bowl
</P>
<P>
   This is the farthest flung of the 10 attractions, but it is an
L.A. institution that shouldn't be missed. Nothing can match a
summer night of classical or popular music in the open-air splendor
of this hillside amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rare venue that will allow you to bring in your own
food _ and even your own alcoholic drink. Up and down the rows, and
in the boxes closer to the stage, patrons sup from their picnic
baskets and sip from their bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   This week's entertainment offerings are typically eclectic:
Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Carousel,'' performed by the Hollywood
Bowl Orchestra and some Broadway singing talent (tonight);
Rachmaninoff, performed by the L.A. Philharmonic and pianist
Nicolai Lungansky (Tuesday); jazz with Dave Brubeck, his quartet
and the bowl's Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra (Wednesday); Ravel
and other Latin composers performed by the Philharmonic and
guitarist Manuel Barrueco (Thursday); and, for a touch of
Hollywood, John Williams conducting the Philharmonic in his
movie-theme hits (``Star Wars,'' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,''
``Schindler's List,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all the important stuff at a political convention
happens at night. So DNC visitors might want to sneak off to the
Bowl for daytime rehearsals. They're conducted from about 9 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. for all performances except Wednesday's jazz show (sound
check held in the afternoon, undoubtedly to accommodate night-owl
musicians). And here's something that should really appeal to
politicos: They're free.
</P>
<P>
   9. Griffith Observatory
</P>
<P>
   This represents another delightful slice of L.A.'s past, but it
also offers an unsurpassed view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was built high on a knoll in the Hollywood Hills in 1933,
long before the glare of millions of incandescent bulbs rendered it
worthless for serious astronomical study. Particularly on summer
nights, when cooler temperatures allow the city's snuggly brown
blanket to lift, the observatory provides a sweeping view from
downtown to the ocean, with Hollywood sprawling in between.
</P>
<P>
   So many lights. So many miles of streets. So many houses. So
many registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   There's no charge to look through the observatory's 12-inch
Zeiss telescope, which is usually trained on a heavenly body that
is big enough to be distinguishable through all the light
pollution. The planetarium theater, meanwhile, features nightly
shows for modest admission rates _ the current feature examines how
Earth's dinosaurs were wiped out by the globe-wide cataclysm that
followed collision with a massive asteroid or comet.
</P>
<P>
   10. Dodger game
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but many teams in major-league baseball have declared
their 1960s-era stadiums obsolete and clamored for new facilities.
Dodger Stadium, despite being built in 1962, still seems to gleam
as if it just opened.
</P>
<P>
   And after a heretical lapse a few years ago when stadium
management started (ITAL)steaming(END ITAL) the hot dogs, the air
is once again filled with the unmistakable aroma of foot-long
Dodger dogs being cooked on an open grill.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are on the road at the beginning of this week, but
convention visitors who are milking an extended stay out of this
event might be pleased to hear that the weekend opposition will be
provided by the formidable New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday night's game in particular (day games are scheduled
for Saturday and Sunday), avoid the outfield bleachers. That way
you can enjoy an experience that probably contributes to the
stadium's timeless charm: Look out over the bright-green field of
play, through the palm trees beyond center field; enjoy the glow of
the setting sun on the Elysian Hills and the cool of gathering
dusk.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this, who needs Disneyland? &QL;

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
! 1/2 ``Bless the Child'' Yet another ``Exorcist'' and ``Omen''
knockoff, more hollow than scary. Good guys Kim Basinger and Jimmy
Smits battle devil's disciple Rufus Sewell for custody of a
6-year-old with supernatural powers. As the kid, newcomer Holliston
Coleman is the best thing in the film, but she can't lift the curse
of a pedestrian screenplay. (R) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Cecil B. DeMented'' John Waters has fun with both sides of
the movie spectrum, puncturing megabore mainstream and
sanctimonious indie types. But the film runs out of steam. It
admires the energies of guerrilla filmmaking, but can't recapture
them, settling for irony instead. Not that Melanie Griffith ever
lets down. She's a source of nonstop fun as an aging movie queen
held hostage by film renegades in a replay of the Patty Hearst
kidnapping. (R) 
 
!!! ``The Little Thief'' French director Erick Zonca follows up his
extraordinary ``Dreamlife of Angels'' with another portrayal of a
teen falling through the cracks of the new Europe. A young man
fired from a baker's job takes up with low types aspiring to
gangster lives in Marseilles, only to find himself at odds with the
nonstop violence. (Unrated) 
 
!!! ``The Opportunists'' Gritty, involving slice of life from a
crumbling ethnic enclave in Queens. It's centered by the
extraordinary rightness of Christopher Walken's performance as an
ex-con trying to stay clean. He wants to make a life with his
tavern-owning girlfriend (nicely nailed by Cyndi Lauper), but a
pushy Irish visitor attempts to pressure him into another heist.
(R) 
 
!! ``The Replacements'' This film about football temps getting a
belated shot at glory during a pro players' strike never met a
cliche it didn't like. Yet it's more entertaining than it deserves
to be, thanks to engaging performances, including Keanu Reeves's
uncharacteristically relaxed one as the salvage boat operator (get
the symbolism?) quarterbacking them. (PG-13) 
 
!!!! ``The Tao of Steve'' Jenniphr Goodman has made a smart,
sparkling, convention-defying comedy about a fat slacker in Santa
Fe who somehow still attracts women even though his star has faded
since his high school babe-magnet days. Donal Logue delivers one of
the year's most improbably delightful performances as Dex,
reminding us that brains and humor can be sexier than abs. Greer
Goodman is a find, too, as a savvy woman who likes him, but is too
smart to fall for his line. (R)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Wonderland'' Michael Winterbottom's London soap opera, shot
in raw verite style, plays out engagingly and compellingly. Credit
the bright, bristly ensemble that brings vast reserves of gusto and
resilience to its screenful of characters. Though they slosh around
in loneliness and misery, they never quit _ and the women (led by
Gina McKee's gawky placer of ads in the personals columns) never
give up on one another. (R)

MOYNIHAN: PROFESSOR BECOMES POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography 
By Godfrey Hodgson. 
Houghton Mifflin. 464 pp. Illustrated. $35. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has had a dazzling assortment of careers: naval officer,
bartender, professor, speechwriter, sub-Cabinet official, city
council candidate, White House adviser, ambassador, and, since
1977, an adornment to the US Senate. In January of 1993, the
capital guessed about the new chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. In the apt words of David Rogers in The Wall Street
Journal, ``Washington has always wondered whether Pat Moynihan was
the professor playing the politician or the politician playing the
professor. This year, Washington finds out.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington did and so did New York, as the chairman adroitly
raided the federal pork barrel on behalf of the Empire State's
schools, hospitals, and transit systems. The politician persevered
without losing his academic edge; the professor's briefcase bulged
with bacon. ``Pat can count,'' Bob Dole said. ``He always knew
where the votes were.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Almanac of American Politics,'' Michael Barone declares
that Moynihan is ``the nation's best thinker among politicians
since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since
Jefferson.'' Godfrey Hodgson, a keen British observer of American
politics, tests this thesis in ``The Gentleman From New York'' and
mostly agrees with it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a friendly biography, but amply quotes Moynihan's
critics. Nearly everyone forgets his harshest foes from 1970 and
even an unfriendly biographer would find it hard to prove the most
frequent charge, that Moynihan counseled ``benign neglect'' of
blacks in America in a memo to President Nixon. The memo emphasized
that ``the issue of race could benefit from a period of `benign
neglect.' The subject has been too much taken over to hysterics,
paranoids and boodlers on all sides. We may need a period in which
Negro progress continues and racial rhetoric fades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Benign neglect,'' an obscure phrase from 19th-century British
politics, was instantly seized by the aforesaid ``hysterics,
paranoids and boodlers'' who battered Moynihan with charges of
racism. He was for affirmative action before most people were, but
was accused of bigotry in 1965, when he was assistant secretary of
labor in Lyndon Johnson's administration. ``The Negro Family: The
Case For National Action'' brought accusations that because it
focused on children born out of wedlock, its author was therefore a
bigot. Many politicians claim they are misunderstood. Pat Moynihan
was deliberately misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   On his own, as a senator, he has faced few such problems. To
begin with, he had as a campaign manager his wife, the former
Elizabeth Brennan. They met in Albany while both worked for
Governor Averell Harriman and she has steered her husband to
comfortable majorities four times. Many Moynihan speeches are too
abstract for his colleagues, his range of interests astonishes
them, and his gift for prophecy bedazzles them. Because he had
predicted the implosion of the Soviet Union, even an inveterate
red-baiter, Jesse Helms, signed off on a plan to reduce government
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's patient pursuit of his own interest in architecture
has served the nation and the nation's ``Main Street,''
Pennsylvania Avenue. It took perseverance through seven
presidencies, but that boulevard is finally grand. Above all,
Hodgson argues, he has stood for standards, an often lonely
position. ``In 1992, in an academic lecture at Yale, he coined one
of the phases that will become part of his intellectual legacy,''
the author writes. ``Defining deviancy down'' was a call to
standards which, like many Moynihan observations, also transcended
ideology. Hodgson quotes John Kenneth Galbraith, who told him,
``You will never understand Pat in terms of commitment to Left or
Right. He has a mind wholly free from ideological commitments. His
long-term commitment is to cities, the poor, and especially to poor
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But how could he work for Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon,
and Ford? How could he shed neoconservatives in the 1970s and
reemerge as a liberal in the 1980s and 1990s? Hodgson, now at
Oxford University, has devoted this sprightly, readable biography
to answering such questions. He often quotes his countrymen, in
this instance, John Maynard Keynes. ``When circumstances change,''
Keynes said. ``I change my opinion. What do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Hodgson cites an American thinker and
politician ``to address a topic on which little has been written
but much said. Pat Moynihan has always liked a drink. His father
was a drinking man, after all, and his mother ran a bar.'' Hodgson
testifies that in many meals with his subject since 1962, ``I have
never seen him lose his temper or lose control under the influence
of alcohol.'' In dealing with gossip, he concludes, ``my own
judgment inclines to that attributed to Abraham Lincoln. When they
told him (Ulysses S.) Grant drank too much whiskey, he is reputed
to have said, `Go out and find out what kind of whiskey he drinks,
and give a barrel of to some of my other generals.!' ''
</P>
<P>
   America could use 99 more barrels of this stuff and 99
senatorial biographies, if only their subjects merited such a
well-written ode to triumph and survival.

FLOCK DESCENDS TO HEAR RUSSELL CROWE SING

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
AUSTIN, Texas _ Thirty Odd Foot of Grunts has no hit singles, no
major label record deal and sells its albums primarily over the
Internet. So how could this virtually unknown country-rock band
inspire more than 2,000 people _ mostly women _ to stand in the
sweltering Texas sun all day just to see them perform at a barbecue
joint?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I passed up a trip to St. Tropez with my boyfriend to come to
this show,'' said Elizabeth Strapp of Long Beach, Fla., who waited
in line Friday with her sisters, Laura Strapp and Jennifer Grace.
``It will be worth it if he takes his shirt off.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't know who the ``he'' doffing his shirt is? Been to the
movies this summer?
</P>
<P>
   TOFOG's lead singer and guitarist is the crystal-eyed lead actor
from ``Gladiator.'' The exceedingly handsome guy with brawny arms
that protruded from his tunic to kill men twice his size in the
movie's Roman Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   The new beau of Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated star of ``The Insider'' who's among
Hollywood's most-coveted commodities now that ``Gladiator'' has
earned more than $180 million domestically and $409 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe, actor and New Zealand native, could have sat on
stage making noise with his armpits and still drawn a cluster at
this show.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to come to Austin for a couple of months, record a
new TOFOG album and play a few local gigs on Friday nights just to
stay loose.
</P>
<P>
   Nice and quiet. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move out of the way,'' a female voice shouted at the one male
standing near the front of the line as the gates opened at Stubb's
Bar-B-Q. ``There are women who want to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't kidding. It looked like the biggest bachelorette
brisket party ever thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's quiet summer vacation was no longer on the QT.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Carmichael, a 37-year-old mother of three from Des
Monies, Iowa, readied herself to go in after holding the line since
5:45 a.m. with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done anything like this, but my 8-year-old daughter
thinks its pretty cool,'' says Carmichael, who ordered her tickets
for the second of three Friday shows off eBay for $100.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to her wearing matching handmade ``Grunt Girls''
kerchiefs were Jill Jaffe of Los Angeles and Sara Baird of
Carthage, Mo. The two women, both 26, met online while buying their
tickets and decided to meet in Austin and see TOFOG together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've downloaded some of the songs off the Internet,'' said
Danette Radisson, a Houston middle school teacher who drove to the
show with her sister Linda. ```The Insider' got me very curious to
see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd had come from as far away as London and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   It all had to be very validating, if not a little frustrating,
for Crowe and his band of Grunts. Yes, all the money raised was
going to benefit the People's Community Clinic, an Austin nonprofit
community medical center, making it a huge crowd for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-hour-plus set of 20 songs seemed lost amid talk of
Crowe's earlier ride around town on a motorcycle (true) and rumors
that Ryan and Jodie Foster would be in attendance (untrue,
according to the band's public relations reps). Many fans got so
caught up in the spectacle that they missed the music.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because it wasn't too bad.
</P>
<P>
   On the amphitheater's half-shell stage adorned with the flags of
Australia, New Zealand and Texas, Crowe demonstrated that he's a
spectacular storyteller with not a half-bad Shiner Bock-enhanced
growl. In Texas that's high praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of Barry Kable'' was a meandering Bruce
Springsteen-style yarn that substituted the outback for the back
roads of New Jersey. ``What's Her Name'' was a great example of the
measured spare guitar-strummed beginnings to full bass drum
bashing, amp-smashing climax that TOFOG does best.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating between guitar playing and hip-wiggling dances,
Crowe came off as the clear leader in the ever-growing ``actors
with side careers as rock stars'' genre. His ability to negotiate
chord changes certainly could rival Keanu Reeves' bass licks with
Dogstar and his harmony leaves Bruce ``Bruno'' Willis dying hard.
</P>
<P>
   All of this says as much about Crowe as it does the rest of
TOFOG. The rhythmic dexterity of guitarists Dean Cochran and
drummer Dave Kelly should not be questioned. And the falsetto
backing vocals of new guitarist Dave Wilkins were marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   If Crowe, with his bed-head tangle of wavy hair and devilish
smile, ever did lose his way in a song these guys righted him so
quick no one noticed.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't matter if he was stripping to a tank top,
mimicking a Texas accent or offering a beer bottle cap up for
auction on eBay, he pleased. It will be interesting to see if, with
time, TOFOG can bring people out as much for the music as they do
for the between-song theatrics by the band's leading man.

<P>
   Support services for people with autism _ children and adults
alike _ fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased
behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside
their family homes, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   People with autism, a disorder that affects brain development,
tend to have trouble communicating and relating to the outside
world. More than a half-million Americans have autism or some form
of pervasive developmental disorder, says the Autism Society of
America.
</P>
<P>
   More cases of autism are being diagnosed than ever before, in
part because of changes in diagnostic criteria, says study
co-author Marsha Seltzer, a professor of social work at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service system is experiencing a crunch. In some states,
families have to have to wait several years or longer to get the
services they need,'' Seltzer says.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people think of autism as a childhood disease, she
says it's really a lifelong struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents just shoulder a tremendous responsibility,'' Seltzer
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right
around the time of diagnosis,'' she says. After that, she says,
``It almost falls off the face of the research charts, but it never
leaves the sphere of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families surveyed by Seltzer and her colleagues think their
autistic children lack essential services. Her on-going long-term
study involves approximately 400 Wisconsin families who have either
an adolescent or adult child with autism. Roughly 40 percent of the
autistic participants are aged 20 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   David Holmes, who chairs the Autism Society of America's panel
of professional advisors, echoes the sentiments of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexities of autism require more specialized adult
services,'' Holmes says.
</P>
<P>
   Autistic people need specialized services, experts say, because
the disease is multifaceted, with wide-ranging symptoms, and
because autistic people often have a secondary condition.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the autistic subjects, for instance,
also have mental retardation, obsessive-compulsive disorder or a
seizure disorder, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Without special help, especially for autistic adults living away
from their parents, behavioral and social problems develop, say the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Because autistic people need a stimuli-controlled environment,
as well as fairly constant training in communications, behavior
management and task completion, Holmes says generic programs don't
work _ and even can harm those with autism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adult services for other forms of developmental disabilities
are not often appropriate for adults with autism,'' Homes says.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, ``Adults with autism can continue to develop new
skills if only given the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer and her colleagues presented their early findings last
week at a meeting of the International Association for the
Scientific Study of Disability in Seattle. Funded by the National
Institute on Aging, the study is a joint effort by researchers at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Brandeis University, in
Waltham, Mass.

&HT;     NINER'S MAIN DISTRACTION IS FAR FROM THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Terrell Owens, a five-year receiver for the
San Francisco 49ers, is exhausted. Not physically, for his body is
in the best of shape. Rather, Owens is dealing with the emotional
trauma of coping with the Alzheimer's disease that has stricken a
close and dear relative.
</P>
<P>
   Owens has broken down with coaches and even reporters while
talking about the insidious march of the degenerative disease into
the mind of his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Black's wisdom and reasoning are being crowded out by
befuddlement and confusion. To see a woman so strong and
disciplined subjected to Alzheimer's damage tortures Owens.
</P>
<P>
   With no father figure to speak of, Owens was raised by his
grandmother and mother, Marilyn Owens. The relationship between
Terrell and his grandmother was never easy.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Black, 66, is from a different world. She grew up in
Alexander City, Ala. And to her, the trappings of modern culture _
television, airplanes, sporting events _ are almost evil.
</P>
<P>
   Black fiercely shielded her grandson in his adolescence. Owens
wasn't allowed to play sports, or even run around with neighborhood
children. He couldn't ride his bike in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Owens passed his time by himself, peddling up and down the
driveway, or by tossing a football to himself. Owens didn't play
sports until his teens when his mother signed him up for football
behind Alice Black's back.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, of course, resented his grandmother for disallowing
sports, television or radio. But nevertheless, a bond as strong as
rope was woven between the two.
</P>
<P>
   She is his rock. When things are tough, Owens will call her and
she will pray to him over the phone. Now 26 years old, and
tremendously successful, Owens feels no resentment about how he was
brought up. What he does feel is compassion for what his
grandmother must now endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hurts me because she was walking in and out of the
house about a month ago,'' Owens said while sitting in the shade
after a recent training camp practice. ``I talk to my mom every day
and it seems like she gets worse every 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Owens is now playing the mother to her mom. Black moved
in with her daughter in the house Terrell had built in Alexander
City after signing his first pro contract.
</P>
<P>
   Owens thinks of his grandmother's declining health even during
training camp practices. But there are times when the demands of
his career occupy him.
</P>
<P>
   Owens is attempting to patch a somewhat damaged image. His
receiving numbers fell off after signing a 7-year, $35 million
contract before the 1999 season. A shoulder injury and ankle sprain
dogged him most of last season, and Owens never established a
chemistry with new quarterback Jeff Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' persistent losing made Owens surly and quieter than
usual. Owens' strained relations with the media grew worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been media-friendly, but those are the types of
things I've tried to work on, to have a better attitude,'' Owens
said.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce loner and distrustful, Owens is trying to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a moody person,'' he admitted. ``Those (media relations)
are things I thought about during the offseason. I pray on things
like this, because I try not to rub people the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   A larger challenge looming in front of Owens is his place on the
team. The offense is trying to make the slow transition from the
aging Jerry Rice to Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the confidence to say I'm as good as he is right now,''
Owens said. ``Sometimes, when I'm out there, sometimes I feel I can
just take over the ball game. But I'm not going to create a
distraction, and tell them (the coaches) to throw me the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that going to hurt in the long run? It will probably
hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens usually stays after practice to take extra throws from
Garcia. The added work has yet to manifest itself on the field.
Against San Diego, Garcia failed to throw a pass to a wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia couldn't find Owens during a recent two-minute drill
in practice designed to highlight the 6-foot-3, 220-pound target.
</P>
<P>
   But Owens' mind floods with other concerns when he leaves the
field. One of his only solaces is his 9-month-old son, Terique, who
lives with his mother in Hayward, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dear to me,'' said Owens, who visits often and had
Terique with him for a time in the offseason during a visit to
Alexander City. ``He's a great joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens is standing on the threshold of life's fragile cycle,
caught between his fading grandmother and infant son. Owens is now
the caretaker in his family, not only for Terique but his
grandmother too.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, Owens appears determined to give his son
something he never had.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and my grandmother were pretty much my mom and dad,''
Owens said. ``I'm going to give him me, as a father.''

SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES TO SET UP WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL FOR SIERRA
LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council agreed Monday to set
up a war crimes tribunal for Sierra Leone, where brutal rebel
armies have engaged in torture, amputated limbs and destroyed
villages to intimidate civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed by a 15-0 vote, stopped short, however, of
actually establishing the court or deciding its composition and
functions. There are some lingering questions over the how
authority should be shared between Sierra Leone's judicial system
and neutral international legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the council asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to
address these and other questions and to produce a detailed
blueprint for the court within 30 days. The council had been ready
to vote on the court Friday, when Russia asked at the last minute
for more time to study the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador, said in an interview
that the secretary general will be bound by a council consensus
that the court has to have international input, even if council
members were not all in agreement on details.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not have the option of saying, `Put it all under
Sierra Leone,''' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal will be the third to be created over the last
decade of increased civil conflict, following the establishment of
war crimes courts for the Balkans and Rwanda. Plans for a fourth
court, to try officials of the Khmer Rouge, who were responsible
for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians in the 1970s, are
in the final stages of negotiation with the Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
   The newest tribunal is to try ``crimes against humanity, war
crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian
law, as well as crimes under relevant Sierra Leone law committed
within the territory of Sierra Leone.'' It will draw on precedents,
but it will at the same time be tailored to Sierra Leone's
particular situation, diplomats said Monday. The country has a
democratically elected government, which has asked for
international help with the court and is expected to cooperate
fully.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent prisoner to face the Sierra Leone tribunal is
expected to be Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary
United Front, who jettisoned a 1999 agreement with the government
of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and resumed attacks on the Sierra
Leone army. In May, his forces also captured 500 U.N. peacekeepers.
They were all subsequently released, but not without embarrassment
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh is now in Sierra Leone's custody. Some of the concerns
about the composition and functioning of the court rest on the fear
that Sankoh will try again, as he has in the past, to bargain for
amnesty if the country's weakened judicial system has control of
the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The council called Monday for a tribunal based on
``impartiality, independence and credibility,'' and suggested the
possibility that appeals hearings, at least, may have to be held
outside Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that several important steps have now been taken
by the council on Sierra Leone. Last month, the council voted to
ban diamond sales from the country until a certification system is
put into place by the government. Diamonds have been fueling
Sankoh's war and enriching the president of neighboring Liberia,
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the council voted to strengthen the role of the
peacekeeping force, giving it authority to ``take down the RUF,''
Sankoh's rebel army, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   The next move on Sierra Leone will be the expansion of the
peacekeeping force, now limited to 13,000 troops. Council members
expect Annan and the peacekeeping department to recommend a number
between 19,000 and 25,000. The Clinton administration, usually
skittish about approving large peacekeeping operations because of
opposition in Congress, is backing the highest number this time.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that in recent days both George W. Bush and his
leading foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice, have given public
support to a strong bipartisan policy on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Some differences over the jurisdiction of the tribunal arose
between the United States and Britain, which had taken the lead in
responding to the crisis in Sierra Leone. Holbrooke said that the
disputes were ``technical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted an international umbrella over the court, but we
didn't want to create a third tribunal because they are very
expensive and very slow and we wanted to move fast,'' he said.
``There was initially some thought among some lawyers in Washington
and New York and London that this ought to all be under Sierra
Leone law.'' In the end, the council fell somewhere between.

<P>
   Cocaine addicts looking to get clean may want to turn to needles
for help.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is
an effective treatment for cocaine abuse. The finding gives the
ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine,
experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study
from a major American medical school. A report on the finding
appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Although the work might be the first large, controlled trial of
acupuncture for cocaine addiction, it's not the first time anyone
has used the treatment for substance abuse. Indeed, some 1,000
clinics worldwide offer the needle therapy for the symptoms of
cocaine withdrawal, including nearly 175 in New York state alone,
says Dr. Michael Smith, a pioneer in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Cornell University psychiatrist who has been practicing
acupuncture at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx for nearly two
decades, calls the Yale research ``a very well-documented report
with high standards that shows that acupuncture helps reduce the
craving for cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Yale psychologist Arthur Margolin, looked at
the effectiveness of acupuncture in 82 heroin and cocaine addicts
who were getting methadone for the first habit but nothing for the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Margolin and his colleagues split the subjects into three
groups. The first received eight weeks of standard addiction
acupuncture therapy, based on guidelines from the National
Acupuncture Detoxification Association, which calls for three to
five needles placed at specific points in the outer ear. The second
group had sham needles placed in non-therapeutic sites on the ear.
The third group watched relaxing videos.
</P>
<P>
   Urine tests for cocaine were taken three times a week over the
trial's two-month period, during which all patients received
counseling and group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   By the last week of the trial, nearly 54 percent of the patients
in the acupuncture group had cocaine-free urine, compared with 23
percent of those in the sham needle group and only 9 percent of
those who watched videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a highly active placebo arm and we still found an
effect over and above that,'' says Margolin, who notes that the
effect of acupuncture was as good as that from drug treatment for
cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS STILL A MYSTERY
</P>
<P>
   While the latest work suggests that acupuncture helps control
cravings for cocaine, it doesn't say anything about why it
succeeds. ``Quite honestly, we don't know why it works,'' Margolin
says. ``We're just beginning to look in Western terms'' at the
biological mechanism behind acupuncture's effect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, says tests show that the needles, if properly
placed, restore balance to the body's electrical currents.
``Acupuncture helps the body help itself.'' Still, he admits, no
one really understands the full mechanics of this assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Margolin and Smith agree that acupuncture
alone isn't a sufficient treatment for addiction, be it to cocaine,
alcohol, tobacco or other substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a treatment that helps a person participate in all the
other treatments we have,'' such as counseling and group therapy,
Smith says. In fact, by law, ear acupuncture for addicts can only
be performed in the context of a licensed drug-treatment program
that includes these other methods, he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, acupuncture does have a key advantage over counseling,
Smith says. If addicts refuse to acknowledge their drug cravings,
therapists have little recourse to treat them. But with
acupuncture, he says, addicts can get treated without losing face.
``You can treat a problem that the patient doesn't admit to.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Mitchell, a licensed acupuncturist and executive
director of the Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Alliance in
Olalla, Wash., says the Yale research lends an extra measure of
credibility to the practice. On the other hand, Mitchell says, with
an estimated 15,000 licensed acupuncturists in the United States
already, the field is well on its way to becoming mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance companies now reimburse for the treatment, which
got a major shot in the arm in 1997 when the National Institutes of
Health held a consensus conference to discuss the scientific
validity of needle therapy. That report found that acupuncture
helped control pain from dental procedures, menstruation and other
conditions, with fewer side effects than conventional remedies,
Mitchell says.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a long distance from the political
conventions that nominated Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt to
the weeklong infomercials that are called conventions today. Once
conventions were battlefields where real fights were waged over
platforms, personalities and power. Vice presidential choices were
not made beforehand; the selection of the presidential nominee was
seldom sure until the convention had run its course. Conventions
had lives and logic all their own. And they mattered.
</P>
<P>
   This was true for both parties, but the conventions where I
observed it were Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia in 1948, Hubert Humphrey, then mayor of
Minneapolis, gave a speech that made history. ``The time has
arrived,'' he said, ``for the Democratic Party to get out of the
shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright
sunshine of human rights.'' President Harry S. Truman accepted the
civil rights platform, causing the Dixiecrats to bolt the
convention, splitting the party _ or so it seemed. In fact, Truman
united the party by giving it a cause.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, in Chicago, delegates drafted Gov. Adlai Stevenson of
Illinois at Truman's urging _ the last presidential draft. Four
years later, when Stevenson was nominated again, he threw the
choice for vice president open to the convention, which eventually
nominated Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. I supported Humphrey, by
then a senator, and managed his campaign on the convention floor.
John F. Kennedy was also a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1968. The Democratic Convention was controlled
by President Lyndon Johnson and Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago. The
process was corrupted and the people betrayed. Even the effort to
pass an antiwar platform was stifled.
</P>
<P>
   The last real Democratic convention was in 1960. Although
Kennedy arrived in Los Angeles in very good shape, his nomination
was not a sure thing. The reason was Stevenson, who still commanded
considerable support even though he had done little to promote his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the convention, I attended a pro-Stevenson
luncheon at which Eleanor Roosevelt spoke, and I spoke at a
late-night rally.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the Minnesota delegation's leaders caucused on the
question of whom to support. Humphrey was undecided. Gov. Orville
Freeman, who would be making Kennedy's nominating speech, argued
for supporting him on the first ballot. I announced my support for
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening I placed Stevenson's name in nomination on the
floor. Only 79 of the 1,512 delegates voted for him. But the
demonstrations after my speech and the seconding speech were far
more intense and enthusiastic than those for the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were strong for Adlai cheered, of course. Others
uttered purging cries of approval to make their change of loyalty
easier. And the rest cheered simply as a testimonial to the career
and example of Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   That 1960 convention marked the end of the active political
career of Adlai Stevenson, the purest politician of our times. He
was indifferent to what history might say about him and, in 1956,
willing to be a sacrificial candidate for the common effort. He
became a national figure not because of the press, or even
primaries, but because of conventions.

1971. Keith Burris, the editorial page editor of The Journal

   Chris Rock returns for a fifth season of his self-titled HBO
show tonight at 12:00 a.m., with two Emmy nominations pending _ for
best variety, music or comedy series, and best writing. The show
won its first statuette last year, for writing, and as with HBO's
``Dennis Miller,'' the opening monologues are the best part of the
show. Rock's mind is nimble, and his take on life is anything but
predictable. But unlike a typical episode of Miller's show, the fun
continues after the initial rant, with pre-taped comedy bits, guest
interviews and music.
</P>
<P>
   At deadline, Rock's guests were still unannounced, but we hope
the comedy bits will include his recent ``Free Bobby Brown'' vigil
outside a Florida jail. That was a bit, Chris, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Pssst! We hear the chickens are going
to make a break for it tonight!
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the Band,'' ABC at 9:30: The replacement O-Towner
arrives for an audition. Preceding this, at 9, there's a repeat of
last week's episode when Ikaika quit the band, opening up the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence,'' NBC at 8: Dr. Jim (Mike Farrell) seems to be
spending a lot of time with Syd's photographer friend. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Blues,'' WB at 8: Only terrible tyke Rodney can get baby
Zoe to sleep, so the Bittermans are more than happy to have him
visit. (A rerun follows at 8:30).
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' NBC at 10: A piano
instructor is molesting his students, but it's difficult to get the
testimony of one who could put him away. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``PGA Championship Highlights,'' CBS at 12:35 a.m.: Between
Letterman and Kilborn comes the Tiger Woods show. Or at least CBS
hopes Tiger is still in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina, The Teenage Witch,'' ABC at 8: Torn by trying to
please everyone in making her college decision, Sabrina splits into

<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Through This,'' MTV at 8: New series about a '70s rock

parents. Tonight, Lu fears her mom has fallen off the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Man,'' Sci Fi at 8: Vincent Ventresca is Darien
Fawkes, the small-time thief who bought his way out of jail by

   ``Blue Velvet,'' Bravo at 9: David Lynch's R-rated 1986
melodrama opened the way for a whole world of weirdness, including
Lynch's own ``Twin Peaks'' series. But few people have seen it
lately, and it's worth another look. Kyle MacLachlan stars as the
nice young lad who tries to solve the mystery of a severed ear;
Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper top the cast of lunatics he

   ELECTRIC MEMORY ERASER
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes in spy movies in which secret agents have their
memories erased may be more fact than fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In testing whether more powerful electroconvulsive therapy could
speed relief of depression, researchers at Wake Forest University
Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., found that these
treatments also wipe out memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person had ECT during May, then their memory of what had
happened in the months of April and May would be at risk of being
forgotten, perhaps forever,'' says Dr. W. Vaughn McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this shortcoming, researchers say the treatment is
effective.
</P>
<P>
   DRUNKEN MUTANT MICE
</P>
<P>
   Some drink to forget. Mutant mice drink because nature forgot to
give them the gene that produces the brain protein called Protein
Kinase A (PKA). ``This is the first direct evidence that PKA is
associated with the voluntary consumption of alcohol,'' says Todd
Thiele, head of the University of Washington research team that
made the discovery. Allowed all the alcohol they wanted, mutant
mice drank twice as much as normal mice. And mutants had milder
hangovers. The research may help find treatments for human
alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   SWAN SONG FOR MILITARY GPS?
</P>
<P>
   A White House order that recently gave civilian GPS users access
to high accuracy signals has fueled rumors that the Pentagon is
building a new military navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts say that GPS satellites have become
vulnerable to rogue missiles. GPS has also performed poorly in the
field, in one case being jammed by homemade transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   A ``gravity mapping'' system like the one used on subs is one
possible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY FOR FUTURE SATELLITES
</P>
<P>
   Ancient technology may cure one of the biggest headaches for
designers of 21st century spacecraft. Power demands on satellites
are rapidly outpacing improvements in batteries. One solution
offered at a recent space conference by Honeywell of Tempe, Ariz.,
uses an idea that's thousands of years old: the potter's flywheel.
</P>
<P>
   For that part of its orbit when a satellite's solar cells bask
in sunlight, the flywheel would behave like a motor, storing
kinetic energy in a fast-spinning composite disc. When the
satellite moves into the dark, the disc's momentum would make the
motor function as a generator.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on satellite design say that a flywheel's inherently
high reliability and ability to withstand an unlimited number of
charge cycles and deliver high-power pulses could make it the
preferred satellite power supply.
</P>
<P>
   STEPPING UP TO 42-VOLT POWER
</P>
<P>
   Your next car could have a 42-volt electrical system _ triple
today's 14-volt charging required for a 12-volt battery. Higher
voltage enables carmakers to power electric steering, shifting,
suspension and braking, more sophisticated communications, and
entertainment and safety systems. Car keys will disappear and be
supplanted by keyless entry, even fingerprint ID. Electromagnetic
valve actuators will replace the engine camshaft. Belt drives will
disappear. The water pump, power steering and a/c compressor will
be electrically operated on demand only, saving power and fuel
otherwise lost to belt drives. All carmakers have agreed to 42
volts, and the first systems will appear next year in Europe. The
changeover will be gradual.
</P>
<P>
   POWERFUL PULSING MAGNET
</P>
<P>
   The most precise and powerful pulsing electromagnet ever created
is now operating at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. It can hammer a sample with a 60-tesla field, pulsing as
rapidly as 1,000 times a second. To keep the system from
overheating it is cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath.
</P>
<P>
   Strength and speed are not the magnet's only virtues. Operators
can control the shape of the magnetic pulse with a degree of
precision that is the highest ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The magnet consumes an enormous amount of power, enough to drive
more than 80 locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHY DEEP-FAT COOKING
</P>
<P>
   If your favorite foods come out of a deep-fat cooker, your
arteries will sing the praises of the Spin Fryer. Developed by
Synergy Worldwide of Alpharetta, Ga., it makes fried foods less
fatty by limiting their contact with cooking oil. Upon starting,
the main chamber tilts 25 degrees, rotating the food in and out of
the oil. At the end of the cooking cycle the chamber returns to its
horizontal position, drains the oil and begins to spin at 800 rpm
while vibrating at ultrasonic frequencies. In 4 seconds the food is
virtually oil-free. The oil itself goes through a carbon filter so
it will be fresh for your next meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Spin Fryer will be manufactured by Salton Maxim and goes on
sale early next year.

   DRIPPING RELIEF VALVE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a problem with my water heater. About 15 to 20 minutes
after a large amount of hot water has been used, the pressure
relief valve discharges water. I called a plumber, and he suggested
installing an expansion tank in line with the water heater. In 30
years as a homeowner, having lived in eight different houses, I
have never heard of this. Is the plumber's solution correct?
</P>
<P>
   _ GREGORY EBENSBERGER, LEESBURG, VA.
</P>
<P>
   A: As water is heated, it expands. In this case, the water's
expansion is probably being limited by a backflow preventer valve
or a nonbypass pressure regulator on the water inlet pipe. This
results in a pressure increase that can be reduced one of two ways
_ by someone drawing hot waterfrom a tap, or by the relief valve
opening on the water heater. In your case, the relief valve
discharges after the hot-water demand has passed because the water
heater's thermostat is still causing the electrical heating
elements to be activated or the burner to fire. The heater is
producing hot water but the hot-water faucets are closed, creating
a pressure buildup that is relieved by the valve. The relief valve
discharges after a large amount of water is drawn because a small
hot-water demand will not cause the heater's burner to fire or its
element to be activated. Thermostats in residential water heaters
let the water temperature drop 15 to 25 degrees before activating a
burner or heating element.
</P>
<P>
   Backflow preventers and nonbypass pressure regulators are valves
that prevent contamination of a municipal water supply system. They
stop water in the house's plumbing from flowing back into the
municipal system.
</P>
<P>
   I agree with your plumber. Installing a precharged, bladder-type
expansion tank on the cold-water inlet between the pressure
regulator and the water heater should correct the problem. The
expanding hot water pressurizes the air in the tank, as opposed to
increasing the system's water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   PAINTING PANELING
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a quick and easy way to rejuvenate the 20-year-old
wood paneling in our family room?
</P>
<P>
   _ LAUREEN S. DOMAIN, PELHAM, AL.
</P>
<P>
   A: The easiest thing to do is to paint the paneling. It's
important to note that, in many cases, the paneling's color may
have been achieved with a fairly soluble stain that can bleed
through paint unless the surface is properly sealed. Therefore, the
first coat should be an oil-based, stainblocking primer. After the
paneling has been primed, it can be topcoated with latex paint.
</P>
<P>
   DE-LIMING TOILET JET HOLES
</P>
<P>
   Q: The rim holes on my toilet have a scale buildup that is
causing the bowl to flush more slowly than it should. I have heard
of using acid to remove this scale, but is it safe?
</P>
<P>
   _ JOHN KLUMP, OTTAWA LAKE, MI.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't recommend that homeowners use a high-strength acid to
remove scale buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of high-strength acid, try swabbing under the rim with
full strength white vinegar, which is generally a 6 percent
solution of acetic acid and water. If the scale buildup is not too
thick, several applications should do the job. The scale
accumulates on the outside of the jet holes because a film of water
adheres to the surface of the porcelain, and when the water
evaporates, the minerals that were in it are left behind. Don't put
the vinegar in the toilet tank-the scale is on the outside of the
rim holes and flushing it through will not be as effective as the
method described above.
</P>
<P>
   If vinegar fails, use a scale-removing household cleaner, but
it's important to follow the product's directions in order to work
safely with it. These cleaners are sold in supermarkets and home
centers.
</P>
<P>
   SQUEAKY FLOORS
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 6-year-old house has carpeted floors that squeak. The best
solution I can think of is to remove the carpet, then go into the
crawlspace and somehow force construction adhesive between the
joist and the subfloor, then screw through the floor from above and
into the joist. Is there an easier or better solution?
</P>
<P>
   _ ROBERT SCHAEFFER, WALLA WALLA, WASH.
</P>
<P>
   A: First, I'm assuming that you don't have hardwood flooring
under the carpet because individual hardwood flooring strips can
squeak.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have hardwood floors below the carpet, your
solution will work, but because of the crawlspace it will be very
difficult. You may consider first driving screws from above, to see
if that prevents the squeaking. If the screws alone don't do the
job, you can always back the screws out and try your method.
</P>
<P>
   Another option you should consider, before resorting to more
difficult repair methods, is using a proprietary tool system called
Squeak No More. With it, you drive a screw right through the carpet
into the joist, and then snap off the screwhead using a tool
designed for that purpose. The screw is specially made. Its shank
is scored so that it snaps off inside the subfloor. The product
costs about $20 at home centers or from the manufacturer. Contact

 (ART ADV: Photos of outboard motors mentioned in the article are
available on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at
212-499-3355.)
 By RICH TAYLOR  
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four decades after mandating the first pollution controls on
automobiles, Environmental Protection Agency regulators have
finally gotten around to outboard motors. The big hit comes in a
few years with the EPA 2006 standard. EPA 2006 mandates a 75
percent reduction in emissions, which essentially means that
conventional two-stroke outboards can no longer be sold.
Manufacturers are scrambling to develop clean-burning engines that
meet the impending rules.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike modern automobiles, which all use similar four-stroke,
EFI technology, outboard motors employ new ideas. However, there
are strong advantages and disadvantages to each technology _
differences that are hard to sort out without head-to-head testing.
</P>
<P>
   TESTING AT LAKE LANIER, NORTHEAST OF ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   The only point at which the new technologies from all five major
outboard motor manufacturers intersect is 115 hp, so that's the
engine size tested by Popular Mechanics technicians. Each
manufacturer's engineers had a whole day to rig and test their
motor, trying different props and mounting positions until they
were satisfied this was the best their engine could do on that hull
on that water on that day.
</P>
<P>
   The factory engineers selected very different propellers, trying
to match the characteristics of their motors to the hull. After
trying three-blade props, the engineers from Honda and Mercury
opted to use four-blade props, which seemed to give quicker
acceleration and noticeably better bite in high-speed corners. The
other manufacturers stuck with their three-blade props, through in
dramatically varied diameters and pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Part art and part science, propping a boat and motor into a
perfect system is just as important as picking the right set of
tires for a NASCAR race car. Our test results are fascinating.
Compared to the blue smoke generators of even two years ago, all
these 2000 model outboards are the very models of decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a computerized fuel injection, they start and run
without a hiccup. All the outboards in this group except for the
EFI Suzuki two-stroke already meet the EPA 2006 standard. Today's
four-stroke outboards are significantly quieter and more economical
to run than today's two-strokes, but are also physically larger and
slower to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   All tests were performed with only a helmsman and test equipment
operator aboard, plus 15 pounds of test equipment and 10 gal. of
fuel. All tests were performed several times over an identical
course to ensure accuracy and repeatability.
</P>
<P>
   Sound level readings were taken with an Extech 407735 sound
level meter reading on the A scale, with the sensor located behind
the helmsman to reduce with and hull noise. Fuel flow readings were
taken with a FlowScan 5900 flow meter. Speed and acceleration
readings were measured with a Stalker Sports Radar, calibrated
before each run.
</P>
<P>
   All motors were tested on consecutive days in a sheltered cove
at the southeast end of Lake Lanier, near Lanier Islands.
Prevailing test conditions: 60 to 70 degrees, 60 to 70 percent
humidity, wind at 3 to 5 knots and negligible chop.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's best-selling Accord sedan has an enviable reputation for
refinement and reliability. To create an EPA 2006-compliant
outboard, Honda engineers cleverly adapted the 2.3 liter
four-cylinder from the Accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Accord's 2.3 liter is rated at either 135 hp or 150 hp. The
outboard is rated at either 115 hp or 130 hp when fitted with a
restricted intake manifold that cuts top-end horsepower. This means
that the 115 and 130 outboards perform similarly across most of the
powerband.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda four-stroke weighs 496 pounds, more than any other
115, which could be more of a factor on a lighter, shorter hull
than the test Kenner. On the other hand, the Honda outboard is
significantly quieter than its competition, significantly more
economical on fuel and, thanks to its long-stroke design, it has a
fat midrange torque curve that makes it easy to tow a skier or push
a heavy boat.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha offers both a 115-hp two stroke V4 and a brand-new 115-hp
four-stroke inline Four that's EPA 2006 compliant. Yamaha elected
to bring the new four-stroke to this test. Compared to the Honda
four-stroke, the 407-pound Yamaha is lighter and more compact. It's
a 1.74-liter Four derived from the existing 1.6-liter F100, but
it's equipped with computerized multiport fuel injection and a
separate throttle valve for each intake runner. This is a very
sophisticated engine, complete with double overhead camshafts and
four valves per cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the lake, the Yamaha was a hairsbreadth slower in
acceleration than the Honda, a decibel or two noisier, 0.6 mph
faster and sipped virtually the same amount of fuel. It also costs
$1,370 less. In other words, pretty much identical.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury's 115 Optimax two-stroke is literally identical to the
Optimax 135 and 150, save for a restrictor ring in the intake
manifold and reprogrammed engine-control computer. Our test 115
certainly wasn't hurting for power. It significantly outperformed
the other 115 outboards at all speeds, while burning about 22
percent more gasoline than the four-strokes at wide-open throttle.
Furthermore, it was the noisiest engine at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The 115 performed like a big motor because it is. At 442 pounds,
the 2.5-liter V6 weighs more than the Yamaha four-stroke. Plus,
there's a sizable tank of oil that must be accommodated. Lift the
engine cowl, and the Optimax seems to have more add-on bits and
pieces than the Yamaha or Honda, which means more potential trouble
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Optimax is Mercury's name for a DFI system that injects the fuel
under about 90 psi of pressure. The theory is that delivering
pressurized, more finely atomized fuel into the cylinders results
in a cleaner burn for more power.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seems to work. During our testing, not only was
Mercury's Optimax the best-performing 115, it went from prolonged
idle to full throttle without a stumble or hint of oil smoke.
That's impressive for a big, six-cylinder two-stroke.
</P>
<P>
   If Mercury's 115 is a detuned 135, you can think of Evinrude's
twostroke 115 as a hot-rodded 90. It's a 1.7-liter, short-stroke V4
that likes to rev. At 349 pounds plus a small external oil tank, it
weighs nearly 150 pounds less than Honda's 115. Dale Kenner sells a
boat similar to ours with twin Evinrude 115s, capable of over 70
mph. He can do that because two Evinrudes weigh only 200 pounds
more than one Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Evinrude uses a DFI system called Ficht, which atomizes fuel
under pressure and squirts it directly into each cylinder at up to
450 psi. As with Mercury's Optimax, the result is a clean-running
two-stroke with no visible smoke and no plug fouling even at
prolonged idle.
</P>
<P>
   In our tests, the Evinrude was the second-quickest in
acceleration behind the big Mercury, but slowest in top speed.
Remember, even though all these engines are rated at 115 hp, the
Evinrude is only a 1.7-liter V4 trying to compete with Mercury's
2.5-liter V6. That's tough. The smaller Evinrude used significantly
less fuel than the Mercury at midrange cruise, but consumed the
same amount at full throttle. It's obviously working harder at high
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Suzuki will introduce an EPA 2006-compliant
four- stroke 115, but for our test, the company elected to go with
its EFI two-stroke that will continue in production for the next
few years. Compared to the Mercury and Evinrude DFI two-strokes,
the Suzuki is similar in performance and noise. It's a detuned
version of Suzuki's 140-hp outboard, but it weighs only 21 pounds
more than the lightweight Evinrude. So it's a very compact and
efficient package.
</P>
<P>
   The Suzuki is a very straightforward outboard: a 1.77-liter
two-stroke inline Four equipped with automotive-style digital
multipoint sequential electronic fuel injection, a secondary
recirculation system to scavenge unburned two-stroke oil and an
integral 6-quart oil tank hidden under the engine cowling that
eliminates the messy separate oil tank still used by Mercury and
OMC. Unlike the others, Suzuki's 115 comes complete with your
choice of stainless steel prop.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Suzuki falls down is in fuel consumption. At 3500-rpm
cruise, it burns more than twice as much gas as the Evinrude.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive motor in this group is the Suzuki, which has
an MSRP of $8,934 and can be bought ``on the street'' for
considerably less. On the other hand, it will also be the most
expensive engine to run, having both the worst fuel economy and
two-stroke oil injection. Suzuki's new four-stroke will correct
these faults, but will likely cost more.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive motor in this group is the Honda at $10,870
(MSRP), though it, too, can be purchased for considerably less. The
Honda and similar Yamaha should be the least expensive engines to
run, since they consume the least amounts of fuel and oil and
should be virtually maintenance-free. They're also the quietest,
which we think is a big plus.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury and Evinrude DFI two-strokes are priced in the
middle, offer the greatest number of dealers, reasonable fuel
economy and the quickest acceleration. The Evinrude, in particular,
is significantly lighter than other 115 outboards, which makes it
perfect for smaller hulls or twin installations.
</P>
<P>
   All five outboards were noticeably better than conventional
two-stroke outboards _ quieter, smoother, more powerful and more
economical. All five seem impressively well finished, with gleaming
clearcoat paints and corrosion _ resistant parts throughout. Which
motor you choose depends primarily on the size and weight of your
hull, which performance characteristics are most important to you
and, truthfully, the best local dealer.

   The final night of the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles
concludes with Al Gore's first major address since his formal
nomination as the party's presidential candidate. Can he give a
speech that will cut into George W. Bush's lead, or even create a
big convention bounce of his own? Or will he give Leno and
Letterman fodder for more jokes about what a stiff he is? It's what
passes for a high-stakes moment this year.

&HT;     JANIKOWSKI IS WORKING OUT THE KINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;    c.2000 San Francisco Examiner
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sebastian Janikowski's kickoff to begin the second half
had just returned to earth at the nine-yard line. On TV, one of the
Dallas announcers wondered: ``They gave him how many million to do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reasonable question. While the Raiders first-round pick
had his moments in Oakland's 21-20 exhibition victory over Dallas
Sunday night, he also had some others that made people wonder why
the team felt compelled to draft him so high and then give him $6.2
million, including a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski did make two of three field goal attempts, hitting
from 47 yards and 44 yards. And his miss was from 57 yards, hardly
a gimme for anyone. However, that is supposed to be in his range
and what was troubling about that kick was it was booted so low
Dallas defensive tackle Brandon Noble, who is only 6-foot-2, still
was able to reach up a paw and deflect it.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, Janikowski was unable to put any of his kickoffs
into the end zone. One was a purpose pooch, but the other two were
not and were returned for good yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cowboys, Janikowski kicked off five times. Only one
made it into the end zone. The others were caught and returned from
the goal line and 1-, 9- and 14-yard lines.
</P>
<P>
   Glum after his performance against the Rams, Janikowski was much
more upbeat the second time around as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It was) better,'' he said, smiling. ``I relaxed a little bit
more. I just went out there and just tried to turn the next page.''
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski knows he isn't kicking off well, but thinks he can
correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm messing up with my steps,'' he said. ``Sometimes I'm
taking two long steps and getting under the ball. If I take it
perfect, the ball is going deep. I got to find out what I'm doing
wrong. Watch the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders coach Jon Gruden was delighted by Janikowski's made
field goals. Asked about the kickoffs, the coach said, ``He had a
few balls _ I don't know if he didn't quite get all of it or half
of it. But he did have one touchback.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the competition for the punting job continued. Leo
Araguz kicked twice. He got off a mediocre kick on his first
attempt, but benefited from a great bounce, and it wound up a
47-yarder. He did an outstanding job his second time, punting the
Cowboys into a hole at the four-yard line. Rookie Shane Lechler
kicked once for 32 yards to the Dallas 13, and got bonus points
from his coach for handling a low snap and setting the ball up for
Janikowski's second field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane did a great job getting the last hold down for
Janikowski,'' Gruden said. ``A great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to evaluate the competition, Gruden said, ``I'm pleased
with both punters. Have been since the beginning of camp. It's very
close, if it's not even.''

&HT;     LAZIO TOUTS HOUSING POLICY IN CONTEST WITH FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ His campaign for the U.S. Senate was still in its
infancy and Rep. Rick Lazio needed to show that he, too, could make
serious policy speeches on the hustings _ a favorite tactic of his
Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So the four-term Republican congressman from Long Island turned
to his pet project _ public housing _ while speaking to a crowd of
municipal leaders in Saratoga Springs in June. It was not a
particularly exciting topic, and several in the crowd fell asleep
during his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But it highlighted Lazio's mainstay in Congress since 1994, an
area of expertise rarely associated with Republicans, in which he
is widely credited with working on both sides of the political
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton challenges the effectiveness and outcomes of Lazio's
work on public housing and welfare reform. Some of the mandates to
come out of the Republican-led Congress _ and, particularly, out of
the House Banking and Financial Services' housing subcommittee that
Lazio chairs _ are described by the first lady's campaign as
``draconian'' measures that would eliminate public housing for some
of America's poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   In his first campaign policy speech _ and one of the only ones _
Lazio envisioned publicly financed communities of people with
diverse incomes. He also spoke enthusiastically about giving states
more power over federal aid, a familiar Republican theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who are working next to people who aren't
working,'' Lazio said. ``We don't want to concentrate poverty.
That's a failed formula of the past, the concentration of poverty,
in some cases the super-concentration of poverty. These are the
things we should be looking at in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I believe in a strong federal partnership on housing
and economic development _ I believe we should be there. ... I just
don't believe we should micro-manage every decision for the local
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after two years of work on the idea, Lazio successfully
pushed through Congress revisions to the nation's public housing
law, which had not been substantially updated since 1937. The law,
hailed as one of the Republicans' most significant legislative
successes of the 1990s, was signed into law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's measure establishes block grants to states for federal
housing assistance, requires public housing tenants to perform
community service and integrates those communities with
economically mixed residents.
</P>
<P>
   But it also forces residents to meet higher income standards for
a subsidized home. Under Lazio's law, the majority of units _ 65
percent _ in a public housing complex are allotted to residents who
make up to 80 percent of an area's median income. Residents who
make up to 30 percent of the area's median income would qualify for
only 35 percent of the available apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the poorest families will have less space in
public housing than those who make more money. Lazio maintains this
provides an incentive for residents to find work. Hillary Clinton
charges that it could strip federal aid from the very people who
need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``believes that mixed-income housing is critically
important, and is in fact one of the reasons New York has amongst
the best public housing systems in the nation,'' according to a
statement released by her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, while some have supported draconian efforts to move
large numbers of low-income people out of public housing, Hillary
has supported a more balanced approach,'' the campaign said. ``As
we focus on addressing the homelessness problem, we shouldn't be
pushing more low-income families out of public housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, did not say how exactly she would change
Lazio's law.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also voted against capping rent for public housing tenants
based on their incomes. Clinton staunchly rejects the measure,
which would allow a tenant's rent to keep rising the more they
earn. Such a stand, critics have said, hints at the conservative
credentials Lazio adopted when the Republicans took over Congress
in 1994, despite his apparent moderate change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lazio voted for a ``Contract With America''
provision that would have severely limited Medicaid, part of an
overall rolling back of subsidized benefits in the push to overhaul
the welfare system. He eventually voted for the Welfare-to-Work
bill signed into law in 1996 by President Clinton after the White
House rejected two welfare reform bills approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, too, supports the Welfare-to-Work law, although
she has said it has not been wholly successful everywhere. ``The
fact is that with the welfare law the president signed, many
communities, though not all, are now moving people to permanent
work,'' she said recently. ``Clearly some places in the country are
doing it a lot better than other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lashed out at Lazio last month for what she said
was his refusal to expand a Federal Housing Authority insurance
program that would have made it easier for more first-time home
buyers to secure mortgages. Lazio did support expanding the FHA
program, but not to the extent House Democrats wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two agree on key areas, such as ensuring housing for
the elderly and veterans, providing transportation for
welfare-to-work participants to help them get to jobs, and severely
limiting food stamps if ``able-bodied'' recipients refuse to find
employment.
</P>
<P>
   And in at least one way, Lazio reached beyond the Clinton
administration to provide more benefits to welfare recipients: his
1998 public housing overhaul raised spending for veterans and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development by $400 million more
than what the Democratic White House initially requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says Republicans don't have an urban policy?'' Lazio said
after the measure passed.

IRON FIST: CAN IT BE BRANDISHED IN MODERATION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They wanted this  &UR; iron fist &LR;  to command them.'' That was the
statement of Arthur Wellesley, the duke of Wellington, about the
need for discipline among the English troops sent to the Canadian
frontier in the 1812 war with the United States. The victor over
Napoleon at Waterloo became known as ``the Iron Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron is hard. An  &UR; iron hand &LR;  is rule that is rigid, stubborn,
severe, even cruel;  &UR; iron-fisted &LR;  has an additional connotation of
``parsimonious, close-fisted, niggardly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was surprising to read in several articles that an  &UR; iron
fist &LR;  was in control of the Republican convention in Philadelphia
early this month. The attribution, though not in direct quotation
of a full sentence, was to George W. Bush himself in the week
before he became his party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times, the prescient R.W. Apple Jr. wrote, ``If
there are abortion rights supporters at the podium this week, for
example, they will talk about something else, thanks to what Bush
calls his ` &UR; iron fist &LR; ' control of the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a curious phrase from a candidate who popularized the
marriage of the adjective  &UR; compassionate &LR;  with the noun
 &UR; conservative &LR; . The decidedly noncompassionate phrase  &UR; iron fist &LR; 
has not even the smooth qualifier that Thomas Carlyle reported in
1850 was used by the Iron Duke's defeated rival: ``soft of speech
and manner, yet with an inflexible rigour of command ... `iron hand
in a velvet glove,' as Napoleon defined it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange that Bush should adopt that phrase; perhaps it was a
slip under stress. Political figures from Austin are sensitive to
the political meanings of words.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Karl Rove (invariably described as ``Bush's chief
strategist''; there is apparently nobody with the title ``deputy
strategist'') demonstrated a grasp of nuance in an interview on The
New York Times/ABC News Webcast at the GOP convention. His
questioner had asked about the gap between the convention's
``moderate, inclusive message'' of those chosen to speak and the
notably conservative views of the delegates shown in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me correct,'' Rove responded quickly. ``You said
` &UR; inclusive &LR;  and  &UR; moderate &LR; .' What we're saying is, it's
` &UR; inclusive &LR;  and  &UR; compassionately conservative &LR; .'''
</P>
<P>
   What was the chief strategist's chief strategy, while accepting
the adjective  &UR; inclusive &LR; , in going out of his way to reject the
nearly synonymous adjective  &UR; moderate &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   Because that word, when used as a noun, causes political
reverberations. From a conservative's point of view, a  &UR; moderate &LR; 
is the liberal's way of avoiding the pejorative tag of  &UR; liberal &LR; .
From a liberal's point of view,  &UR; moderate &LR;  is not only
self-applicable but also a friendly way of describing a Republican
who is not a hard-core, reactionary, troglodyte kook.
</P>
<P>
   The word's political sense was born in the Eisenhower
administration. Minutes of the Nov. 4, 1954, Cabinet meeting
reported the president using the phrase ``a policy of moderation.''
Adlai Stevenson, a year later, told a fund-raising audience:
``Moderation, yes! Stagnation, no!'' At the same dinner, Averell
Harriman, a potential opponent for the 1956 Democratic nomination,
disagreed: ``There is no such word as  &UR; moderation &LR;  in the
Democratic vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative columnist William F. Buckley at that time
wrote, ``I resist  &UR; moderate &LR;  because it is a base-stealing word for
the benefit of GOP liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson Rockefeller wing of the party at first accepted it in
the early '60s, but then supporters of Barry Goldwater used it in
derision, to catch the centrist minority off the Republican
political base. On July 14, 1963, Rockefeller denounced Goldwater
``extremists'' for a philosophy ``wholly alien to the broad middle
course that accommodates the  &UR; mainstream &LR;  of Republican
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   I recall dragging a large banner across the San Francisco Cow
Palace floor at the 1964 convention that read ``Stay in the
 &UR; Mainstream &LR; !'' But as Francis Bacon pointed out in ``On Faction,''
written in 1597, ``A few who are stiff do tire out a great number
that are more  &UR; moderate &LR; .'' The Goldwaterite true believers scorned
the electoral  &UR; mainstream &LR;  and lost in a landslide; four years
later, Nixon steered toward it and narrowly won.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Nixon and his writers shied from the noun  &UR; moderate &LR; ,
still inflammatory to ``real'' Republicans, but embraced its
euphemism  &UR; mainstream &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   President Gerald Ford, after his 1976 defeat, called a meeting
of the Republicans Ronald Reagan, John Connally and Nelson
Rockefeller and used an older metaphor: ``The Republican tent is
big enough to encompass the four individuals who are here today.''
As  &UR; the big tent &LR;  was replaced by  &UR; mainstream &LR; , both were
supplanted by ``the politics of  &UR; inclusion &LR; '' in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the  &UR; iron-fisted &LR;  Bush chief strategist Karl Rove
accepted  &UR; inclusive &LR;  and rejected  &UR; moderate &LR; . Colin Powell followed
up with a convention speech hailing George W. Bush's ``passion for
 &UR; inclusion &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech to the GOP convention in Philadelphia,
Bush repeated  &UR; compassionate conservatism &LR; , defining it in a plain
sentence: ``It is to put conservative values and conservative ideas
into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Where and when did the phrase (akin to Jack Kemp's
 &UR; bleeding-heart conservative &LR; ) originate? In his recent book,
``Compassionate Conservatism,'' Marvin Olasky, professor of
journalism at the University of Texas at Austin (and the Bush
adviser who suggested the phrase to the Bush campaign), provides a
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky suggests coinage by Vernon Jordan, then head of the
National Urban League, who said on July 22, 1981, in criticism of
the Reagan administration, ``I do challenge its failure to exhibit
a  &UR; compassionate conservatism &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   However, four months earlier _ on March 13, 1981 _ in an article
by Judith Miller of The New York Times, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
said: ``I'm a conservative, and proud of it, but I'm a
 &UR; compassionate conservative &LR; . I'm not some kind of ultra-right-wing
maniac, despite some portrayals in the press.'' That remains the
current political sense of the phrase.

   TURKEY-DIG (Sardis, Turkey) _ The daily rythm of a summer's dig
by the Harvard-Cornell Sardis expedition has been repeated with
little variation since 1958. Some archaeologists come and go. But
the continuity is maintained in part because so many keep coming
back (three generations of archaeologists). It has become a

dark skin prevents the absorption of sunlight which is needed to

   _ Using mesh to repair hernias is more effective than repairing
them with stitches when the hernia occurs during surgery, according

The researchers stipulated that stitching the wound could subject
the surrounding tissue to excessive tension while using mesh allows
new flesh and scar tissue to close the gap. (175 words)

   TRAVEL-AUSTRIA-ALPS (Undated) _ Twenty miles southeast of
Vienna, vineyards sweep down from a line of low, wooded hills to a
shallow lake, and Eastern Europe begins. Austria's present-day

but the shift from central, Alpine Europe is sudden, dramatic and

   TRAVEL-ESSAY-ROME (Undated) _ On a study trip to Rome in the

   TRAVEL-AIRFARES (Undated) _ Americans who postponed vacations
this summer hoping that airlines would announce major fare sales
have had good reason to be disappointed: there haven't been any, at
least nothing comparable to those a few years ago. And while most
analysts attribute the paucity of summer discounts to continued
high demand for flights, they note that the carriers' growing
sophistication in knowing when to lower or raise fares on
everything from individual flights to entire routes could spell the
end to the periodic fire sales of years past. By Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Student fares on planes, trains
and buses. By Betsy Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Lead item: Michelin has come up with a
new recipe for a series of guidebooks: to an exotic destination add
one part Red (as in the Red Guide listings of recommended hotels
and restaurants) and one part Green (descriptions of places of
major and minor interest), then fold in a generous helping of
practical information and vignettes about the local culture. The
result is a series called NEOS, with volumes about Tunisia;
Guatemala and Belize; Reunion, Mauritius and the Seychelles; Syria
and Jordan; and Turkey. Due in December are guides to Indonesia,
Rajasthan, and Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The name NEOS is drawn
from the four compass points in French _ Nord, Est, Ouest, Sud.
</P>

   TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Questions: Renting homes in Crete,
touring the Baltic countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) and
traveling Tuscany by train.

   Sometimes assumptions go awry. Usually, the result is not that
costly. Someone orders the wrong kind of sweater for a
department-store chain. A hardware store takes down lots of snow
shovels and sleds, but it doesn't snow.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, however, the mistakes are devastating. An
insurance company misjudges the risk associated with workers'
compensation. A car company doesn't grasp the enormity of a tire
deficiency. A brokerage house misjudges the rate of repayment from
a giant mortgage bond. Or a retailer misjudges the default rate on
its credit business.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is what is happening right now to Federated Stores
(FD on the New York exchange). This giant retailer bought Fingerhut
for about $1.7 billion a year ago. We thought they did it to have
some Internet exposure, because it was during that wacky period
where everyone needed to commit to the Net. Fingerhut was a giant
infrastructure/logistics play. It sounded super.
</P>
<P>
   But Fingerhut was also a low-end catalog company with a steady
clientele and a steady delinquency rate. Before the sale, however,
Fingerhut had been changing some of its credit policies. These
policy changes accelerated under Federated.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts are all pretty deferential to Federated about what
happened next. But Fingerhut basically gutted Federated because the
assumptions Federated had made about Fingerhut's customers were all
wrong. They started defaulting wildly and Federated got completely
smoked by the change in assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Fingerhut wiped out about a buck of Federated's
earnings _ and all of its credibility with Wall Street. Federated
holders dumped the stock like mad. They took out about $1.7 billion
in market value. Irony? That was what Federated paid for Fingerhut.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens now? I am sure the value guys are sniffing. And
I don't blame them. This seems like an overwhacking if there ever
was one. But people hate being bagged. Federated bagged people.
Heck, Federated bagged itself. They probably didn't understand the
habits of the Fingerhut consumers. Why should they? Fingerhut
shoppers don't go to Bloomingdale's. Classic case of not sticking
to your knitting.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up this whole fiasco to one more company trying to please
the Street after sitting out the Web for too long. Ultimately, I am
waiting until year-end tax season to pick this one up. I think it
will still be right here at that time. Too much damage to bounce
back any quicker.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIBLE IS NO LONGER HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Last week I saw that Audible Inc. (ADBL on the Nasdaq) hit that
sickening one-buck level (it closed Friday at 1 27/32). That's the
point of no return for most stocks, as surely as if they've passed
through Halifax on the way to England.
</P>
<P>
   So I took a look at what went wrong. Aside from the tragic death
of its very young CEO last year, astoundingly I can report that
nothing, nothing at all went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was above plan. Everything was what venture capital
firm and key investor Kleiner Perkins might have expected or that
investors Random House and the now nonprescient Amazon (it bought 5
percent of the company at the now stupid price of 15) would have
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Audible grew the market for audio Web downloads in a serious and
methodical fashion. It had books by Stephen King read by Stephen
King. It had issues of key newspapers downloaded audibly on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   It sought and got Microsoft's backing for the downloadable
content. It even gained Robin Williams for a weekly show of
original content.
</P>
<P>
   These guys were smoking, promotion-wise. They were in all of the
papers and constantly on television with puff interviews that made
this company sound like the next RCA!
</P>
<P>
   How about those numbers? All of the bankers who brought this
company public had analysts that consistently applauded the
company's triple-digit revenue growth. So what that it was still in
the hundreds of thousands instead of the millions? The point was
that it was ``better than expected'' and we know that's
nirvana-ville on Wall Street. Or at least it seemed so going into
the April Net correction.
</P>
<P>
   So what went wrong? Absolutely nothing. Audible is a small
company with a small franchise and a small-scale operation that is
valued, well, with a small capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing wrong with Audible is what happened to its stock
in the interim. That's what was wrong. Now everything seems just
right. It's just that nobody made much money except the insiders
who sold right after the Amazon news, just when the nauseating
decline began.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. Now, Audible's just another tree falling in the dot-com
woods. Nobody's hearing it. Rather ironic, now, isn't it?
</P>

   Ants and Aphids
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do aphids milk ants or vice versa? In any event, how can I
rid my houseplants of the aphids?
</P>
<P>
   A. Several ant species ``herd'' the small pear-shaped insects
called aphids and ``milk'' them for a sweet fluid that they excrete
after feeding on sap from roots or leaves. ``American Social
Insects'' by Charles and Mary Michener calls them the dairying
ants. Ants with root-eating aphids often dig them chambers to serve
as ``barns.''
</P>
<P>
   The ants protect their aphids, carry them from plant to plant
and gently stroke them with their antennas to get them to release
droplets of the liquid, called honeydew. Some species of yellow
ants called Acanthomyops feed almost exclusively on honeydew
harvested from roots by aphids.
</P>
<P>
   Aphids harm houseplants and some crops by sapping them of their
fluid and sometimes by coating the leaves with so much honeydew
that mold grows, inhibiting photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural extension agents recommend some steps to counter
aphids on houseplants without using commercial insecticides. First,
isolate new plants until it is obvious that they are not infested,
or remove the infested leaves. If an infestation is advanced, try
swabbing or spraying the leaves with rubbing alcohol or soapy
water, repeating at intervals of a few days to get rid of eggs and
new hatchlings; rinse off the soap. Or buy ladybugs, which feed on
mites, not plants.

   AUTISTIC-ADULTS-MED _ Support services for people with autism --
children and adults alike -- fall far short of fulfilling their
needs today, says a new study.
</P>
<P>
   And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased
behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside
their family homes, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   SHOES-MAGNETS-MED _ Florsheim says its magnet-laden shoes can
ease pain and make your legs and back less tired. But a California
consumer group is not just taking issue with these claims; it is
suing the company for touting them as remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Justice Center, a nonprofit consumer protection
group, filed the suit last week in Orange County and asks that
Florsheim stop advertising the MagneForce shoes as a health aid and
refund the purchase price (about $122 plus tax) to people who
bought the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   COCAINE-ACUPUNCTURE-MED _ Cocaine addicts looking to get clean
may want to turn to needles for help.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is
an effective treatment for cocaine abuse. The finding gives the
ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine,
experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study
from a major American medical school. A report on the finding
appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTIPATION-HISTORY-MED _ Here's a history topic you don't see
with much regularity: constipation. That's right, to the annals of
medical history comes the complete archival guide to the most basic
of bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   And why not, says James Whorton, author of ``Inner Hygiene,''
just published by Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``For centuries, there has been a strong intuitive feeling that
regularity is essential for health, and because constipation is a
topic that affects just about all of us at one time or another,
it's always received a lot of attention,'' says Whorton, a
professor of medical history at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   BRAIN-OSTEOARTHRITIS-MED _ In their efforts to better understand
the nature of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis, researchers are
setting their sights a bit higher -- on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the soft and bony
tissues, is the most common type of arthritis, affecting
weight-bearing joints that include the knee and hip.
</P>
<P>
   The pain is unique, doctors say, because it can be so prolonged
and difficult to manage.

   Safer Nuclear Waste
</P>
<P>
   High-level nuclear waste in storage is like an unruly guest in a
tidy house. The material that's used to contain the waste _ be it
glass, ceramic or whatever _ owes its strength and stability to its
orderly structure, with every atom in its proper place.
</P>
<P>
   Decaying waste, like used fuel from nuclear reactors, upsets the
structure: it produces radiation that causes atoms to shift,
creating defects that can eventually lead to cracks or other
problems that can affect safety. Indeed, most storage containers
are designed to last only a century or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory and
universities in Britain and Japan say that a class of ceramics
known as complex oxides may hold promise for longer-term waste
storage. The key, they say, is that this material is not so
fastidious: it can tolerate radiation-induced defects.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who reported on their work in the journal
Science, first created computer simulations of the effects of
radiation on these materials, and then tested them in the
laboratory. They found that one kind of complex oxide ceramic,
similar in structure to the mineral fluorite, was relatively
disordered to begin with. When radiation starts to monkey with it,
its atoms can shift to accommodate the defects with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that similar materials beyond those that
they studied may also be radiation resistant. In any case, much
more work remains before a satisfactory solution to the problem of
long-term storage of waste is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Rare View of a Comet
</P>
<P>
   The celestial soap opera that is Comet Linear continues.
</P>
<P>
   In our last episode, the comet, after disappointing backyard
star gazers, seemed to be fizzling to oblivion. As Linear made its
closest approach to the Sun late last month, the heat had caused
the comet's nucleus to bubble and blow apart, leaving what
astronomers thought was just a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast. While Linear will never be a recurring
character like other comets, it's not dead yet. The Hubble Space
Telescope and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large
Telescope in Chile have observed a group of tiny comets left behind
as Linear came apart.
</P>
<P>
   There are about a dozen of these ``comettes,'' each consisting
of a small piece of the original nucleus, perhaps 100 feet or so in
diameter, with a tiny tail. While these objects may eventually
disintegrate completely, before they do they may provide insight
into the comet's original structure. Such a cometary breakup has
never been seen in such detail before now.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzle of a Jupiter Moon
</P>
<P>
   For the past several decades, scientists have been intrigued by
cracks and other signs of stretching on the surface of Jupiter's
icy moon Europa. But the scientists have been puzzled by what may
be considered a lack of give and take _ that is, stretching in one
area of Europa must result in squeezing elsewhere, but no solid
evidence of such compression had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But now, scientists from Johns Hopkins and Brown, examining
images taken by the Galileo spacecraft, have uncovered what they
say are folds in Europa's surface caused by compression, like the
ripples in cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   A high-resolution image of one part of the surface, taken when
the Sun was at a low angle, shows subtle shading of a fold's hills
and valleys. Other images show cracks on the tops of the hills and
small ridges in the valleys, kinds of structures that would be
expected in a rippled surface.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, writing in Science, suggest that tidal forces
within Europa caused the compressional folding, and that the
amplitude of the folds was originally much greater _ the hills were
higher and the valleys lower. But over time, because of relatively
warmer conditions below the surface, the folds relaxed, leaving the
faint structures hardly visible today.

PERSONAL HEALTH: ESCALATING THE FIGHT AGAINST ORAL CANCER, BY
LOOKING FOR IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a recent visit for a periodic dental cleaning, my
periodontist took a few extra minutes to examine the roof and floor
of my mouth, upper reaches of my gums and my tongue for possible
signs of an oral cancer or precancer.
</P>
<P>
   The periodontist, Dr. Stephen Goodman, a past president of the
American Academy of Periodontology, told me he had begun such
checkups for all his patients a few months earlier after realizing
that no one _ not primary care physicians, regular dentists or
ordinary people _ has been assigned this responsibility. And in
those first few months he'd already found three cancers and several
precancerous lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Oral cancer is one of those diseases that should never happen.
Its leading causes _ the use of tobacco primarily and, to a lesser
extent, excessive alcohol consumption _ are totally preventable. As
with superficial skin cancers, before oral cancer becomes a
potentially deadly disease, it usually forms precancerous lesions
that can be readily seen. And outside of the skin, the mouth is
probably the easiest place to look for signs of abnormal tissue
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, each year more than 30,000 cases of oral cancer are
diagnosed in the United States and 8,000 people die of this
disease. There has of late been a reduction in overall deaths from
oral cancers, primarily the result of the drastic decline in
cigarette smoking among American adults.
</P>
<P>
   But despite notable progress made in curing several of the more
hidden cancers, once oral cancer develops, the chances of surviving
it have not improved for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed experts insist that this need not be the case. Few
deaths from oral cancer would occur if dentists and physicians
regularly examined their patients' mouths. The death rate is so
high ``because the early cancers are not being caught,'' said Dr.
Arnold Rosenheck, associate dean at the New Jersey Dental School.
``If you find the oral lesion before it metastasizes, the cancer
can be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report, ``Oral Health in America,'' the surgeon
general said that adults generally were ``ill-informed regarding
risk factors for and signs and symptoms of oral cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One national survey'' it continues, referring to a 1995
report, ``found that only 14 percent of adults 40 and older
reported that they had ever had an oral cancer examination. Of
those, only 7 percent had had an exam within the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a national survey of dentists conducted three years later, 70
percent said they provided annual oral cancer exams to patients 40
and older, a statistic that strikes me more as wishful thinking
than fact. I do not live in the boondocks and I've been to at least
four different well-trained dentists since 40. Yet the oral exam
this year by my periodontist was the first such checkup I'd ever
received.
</P>
<P>
   So it may be up to you to ask your dentist or health care
provider to include an oral cancer exam as part of a routine
checkup.
</P>
<P>
   You should also know the signs and symptoms of a possible oral
cancer or precancerous lesion and make sure that any you may find
are promptly examined by a knowledgeable health professional. In a
booklet, ``What You Need to Know About Oral Cancer,'' the National
Cancer Institute points out that while oral cancer usually occurs
in people over the age of 45, it can develop at any age. The
institute lists these symptoms to watch for:
</P>
<P>
   _A sore or lump on the lip or in the mouth or throat.
</P>
<P>
   _A white or red patch on the gums, tongue or lining of the
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _Unusual bleeding, pain or numbness in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   _A sore throat that does not go away, or a feeling that
something is caught in the throat.
</P>
<P>
   _Difficulty or pain with chewing or swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   _Swelling of the jaw that causes dentures to fit poorly or
become uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   _A change in the voice.
</P>
<P>
   _Pain in the ear.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for many decades that repeated exposure of the
oral tissues to cancer-causing substances is the primary cause of
oral cancer. Cancers were found among the peoples of the South
Pacific who regularly chewed carcinogenic betel nuts. In this
country, 80 percent to 90 percent of oral cancers result from
exposure to the carcinogens in tobacco, whether it is smoked,
chewed or stuffed in a cheek pouch.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive alcohol consumption is the second main risk factor,
and when alcohol and tobacco exposure are combined, the risk is
especially high since their combined effect is more than additive.
Sunshine is another factor; excessive exposure can cause cancer of
the lip. So can pipe smoking. Quitting the use of tobacco products
can greatly reduce the risk of oral cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who eventually develop oral cancer have a history of
forming whitish patches inside their mouths called leukoplakia,
usually in the areas that are subjected to chronic irritation, such
as the lower lip of a pipe smoker or the gums and mouth lining of
people who use smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Red patches called erythroplakia, most often found in people in
their 60s, are another warning sign. Both leukoplakia and
erythroplakia can be found even in adolescents who use smokeless
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The usual route for treating oral cancers is surgery to remove
the tumor in the mouth and enough surrounding tissue to make sure
all the cancer is gone. If there are indications that the cancer
may have spread, the surgeon will also remove lymph nodes in the
neck to check for the presence of cancer cells. In still more
advanced cases, the operation may involve removal of muscles and
other tissues. Large tumors may necessitate removal of part of the
palate, tongue or jaw, which can permanently impair the patient's
ability to chew, swallow or talk.
</P>
<P>
   The second line of treatment involves radiation therapy, which
may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor as well as after
surgery to try to destroy any residual cancer cells. The side
effects, which may include soreness of the mouth and permanent
dryness, can make eating a challenge. An acceptable diet is likely
to include soft, bland foods moistened with a sauce or gravy,
soups, puddings, nutritious shakes and nutrient-rich liquid
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   After treatment, patients may need reconstructive surgery to
recreate lost structures in the mouth and training to use dental or
facial prostheses. Speech therapy and dietary counseling are also
often helpful.

   MUSCLE GROUPS: Stretching: Myths, Legends and Facts
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have gained new insight into what happens when
athletes stretch, but the actual advice handed out by coaches,
trainers and even physicians is a hodgepodge of myths and outdated
assumptions, according to an article in the August issue of The
Physician and Sportsmedicine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the common practices are either ineffective or
potentially harmful, said the researchers, who are from Sir
Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital,
both in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of some of the findings they report from
recent studies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stretching before exercise does not appear to decrease the
risk of injury, but it does reduce pain or discomfort from
stiffness, extending the comfortable range of motion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Warming up _ engaging in light activity before strenuous
exertion _ does not increase range of motion, but it does reduce
rate of injury, most likely by increasing the temperature of muscle
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bounce'' stretching _ repeated brief stretches of a muscle _
can increase stiffness and actually be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   _ For most people, one 15- to 30-second continuous stretch will
suffice for most muscle groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adding heat or cold to a muscle makes stretching more
effective, most likely by reducing the pain of stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   _ The best stretching strategy is likely to vary from person to
person and varies depending on injuries.
</P>
<P>
   NUTRITION: A Menu for Fighting Rickets Resurgence
</P>
<P>
   Infants being fed with breast milk only, particularly black
infants, should be given vitamin D supplements, according to a
study that reports a resurgence in cases of rickets, a
bone-weakening condition caused by a deficiency of the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   In an article last week in The Journal of Pediatrics, North
Carolina researchers reported an increase in rickets among all
babies studied, but particularly among dark-skinned babies. Dark
skin hinders the absorption of sunlight, which is needed to make
vitamin D.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers _ Dr. Henry N. Kirkman Jr. of the University of
North Carolina and Drs. Robert Schwartz and Shelley Kreiter of Wake
Forest University _ linked the increase primarily to the growing
popularity of breast-feeding; infant formula has contained vitamin
D supplements since the 1930's. Other possible factors include a
decrease in the use of vitamin supplements and the reduced amount
of time children spend outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Rickets, which until this decade had almost disappeared in the
United States, can lead to a failure to thrive, bone fractures and
bowlegs. ``This disease is 100 percent treatable,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Beyond the Pain of Gastric Reflux
</P>
<P>
   A new article in The Annals of Internal Medicine reports an
association between drugs that have a side effect of allowing
gastric reflux and the rates of a rare but deadly kind of gastric
cancer whose incidence has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an editorial in the same journal said that the findings were
not likely to lead to any immediate decrease in the use of the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on esophageal adenocarcinoma, which has been
on the rise in recent years among men in America and Western
Europe. Previous research had determined that gastrointestinal
reflux, the backward flow of stomach fluid into the esophagus, was
a risk factor for the cancer, which has a five-year survival rate
of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Sweden and the Harvard Center for Cancer
Prevention, speculate that various drugs that loosen the sphincter
at the base of the esophagus, thus making reflux occurrence easier,
could play a role in the rise of the cancer. The medications were
introduced around the time the increase began.
</P>
<P>
   Those drugs included nitroglycerin, asthma medicines like
albuterol and aminophyllines, Valium and a class of intestinal
medicines called anticholinergics.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers collected data on the cases of about 600 people
with the disease from 1995 to 1997 and surveyed the patients and a
control group of healthy men to determine who among them had taken
the medicines in question. The cancer was almost four times as
common among those who had taken the drugs daily for more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the article and the editorial noted that the absolute risk
for the cancer was so low that doctors were not likely to abandon
useful medicines on that basis alone, particularly since the class
of drugs with the highest association, anticholinergics, had fallen
out of favor for other reasons. More study is also needed, the
editorial said, to determine whether the medicines are actually
causing the gastric reflux.
</P>
<P>
   And the researchers wrote that, in one sense, the findings could
be seen as reassuring for users of these medications, because ``our
data suggest that persons who use these drugs for short periods may
be at little or no increased risk.''
</P>
<P>
   OUTCOMES: A Hernia Repair Job That Lasts Longer
</P>
<P>
   Using mesh to repair hernias that result from surgery is more
effective than repairing them with stitches, according to a Dutch
study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Incisional hernias, as such wounds are called, are common
complications of abdominal surgery. The traditional repair has
involved stitching the hole; more recently surgeons have implanted
a mesh that allows new flesh and scar tissue to close the gap. Both
methods have had fairly high rates of recurrence, with conflicting
reports on which one works better.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from University Hospital in Amsterdam,
organized a study that ran from 1992 to 1998 at a number of medical
centers in which 200 patients in need of such surgery were randomly
assigned to sutures or mesh.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years after the surgery, 48 percent of the suture
group had hernia recurrences while only 24 percent of the mesh
group did. The researchers speculated that stitching could subject
the surrounding tissue to excessive tension.

   REACTIONS: Exploring the Circuitry of Sleepwalking
</P>
<P>
   To help figure out just what goes on in the head of a
sleepwalker, a team of Swiss researchers hooked a teen-ager to a
device that measures brain activity, turned out the lights and
waited.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old had been a sleepwalker since childhood, as were
his maternal grandmother, mother and younger brother. The episodes
would occur several times a week, and were occasionally accompanied
by feelings of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Electrodes were placed on the boy's head and the firings of his
neurons were recorded using a technique called single photon
emission computed tomography. About 50 minutes into the boy's
sleep, a mild episode of sleepwalking occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reported in the Aug. 5 issue of The Lancet that
one area of the brain was being turned on and others that normally
functioned in tandem with it remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The activated area, called the cingulate cortex, ``is part of a
functional network that modulates behaviors involved in emotional
processes,'' the researchers wrote. ``Seizures and stimulations of
the cingulate cortex in human beings elicit several motor,
autonomic and emotional responses that are similar to those seen in
sleepwalking and sleep terror.''

ESSAY: A BABY WORKS HER MAGIC ON AN EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By HOWARD MARKEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the warmth of daylight, as I held our brand-new first child,
the night before seemed far away. It was the day after we brought
Bess home from the hospital _ her insurance-mandated 48-hour stay
had expired all too quickly _ and it was time for my wife and me to
begin our new role as parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bess was born two weeks early. In the hospital she was still
fatigued by the ordeal of birth and easily calmed. A soothing
caress, a few words in a deep voice or, more practically, her
mother's breast were all that were needed to settle her down to
sleep. This is going to be simple, I thought, as I looked forward
to being the father of the mythical easy baby.
</P>
<P>
   But her first night home, when our new family was, at last, on
its own, was an entirely different matter. Although placid and
content all day, once midnight rang out, a high-pitched crying
began that abated only briefly at unpredictable moments and would
not cease completely until well after dawn had broken.
</P>
<P>
   While I am subject to all of the foibles of new fatherhood, like
the rest of this fortunate segment of the population, I am also a
pediatrician and the author of a baby care advice book. The advice
book, however, was written several years ago, while I was still a
bachelor without children.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless pediatricians, child psychologists and child care
experts before and since, I filled hundreds of pages with advice
for parents on topics as diverse as breast-feeding and walking.
What's the best way to burp a baby? All you need do is turn to Page
221. How do you hold a newborn? The answer, my friend, can be found
on Page 46. Why do babies cry so much? Now there's an essay worth
reading and committing to memory, Pages 57 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   During those evenings when I wrote my baby care book, after a
decade of practice as a pediatrician, all of my advice about the
health and behavior of babies seemed to make perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, during the long hours of our baby's first night when
singing, frequent diaper changes, attempts at feeding and a host of
new tricks my wife and I invented on the spur of the moment all
failed to end Bess' relentless caterwauling, the words that echoed
in my mind were, What was I thinking when I wrote that stuff?
</P>
<P>
   This is not an inadequacy of my book alone. A brief review of
baby care books over the last century shows that we experts change
our minds and opinions with a rapidity that would confuse even the
most astute parent. In the early 20th century, pediatricians urged
toilet training by six months of age and feeding schedules better
suited for the trains at Grand Central than the average infant.
</P>
<P>
   But rapid and often 180-degree changes in parenting and baby
care are not confined to the past. Witness, for example, recent
changes in how we put babies down to avoid sudden infant death
syndrome or how we discipline toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, much of the advice I dispensed remains a
sound approach to a variety of medical problems encountered. The
tips my colleagues and I offer on infant behavior, however, must be
recognized as mere guideposts rather than exact road maps to
specific destinations.
</P>
<P>
   As I have heard from so many mothers and fathers over the years,
the most vexing questions we parents have about our babies are
vexing for very good reasons. Why do they cry so much? Why can't
they do what we want them to do? Why won't my baby sleep when I
want her to fall asleep? Definitive answers to an individual baby's
behavior are unlikely to be found despite our constant search for
them.
</P>
<P>
   As all experienced parents know (and all good pediatricians
should acknowledge), being a parent is a role that is learned
entirely on the job, regardless of one's educational level,
profession, or even prior experience in writing baby care advice.
What works for some babies, doesn't always work for others, and
what works for your baby today may not work tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to remain unchanged in the history of infancy is
that babies are usually more resilient than both parents put
together and, thankfully, most grow up to search for answers to the
same questions that puzzled their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bess did settle down to sleep. Her parents'
amazement at the miracle of a newborn child remains undiminished,
even greater, than it was. But most important, we understand that
over time all three of us will learn one another's likes, dislikes
and needs, together.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta is so big and hot that it makes its own weather, and
scientists have the pictures to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   While analyzing weather data that had been collected during the
1996 Summer Olympics, Dr. Robert Bornstein, a professor of
meteorology at San Jose State University in California, saw a
pattern in the winds.
</P>
<P>
   The heat-absorbing roofs and pavement were warming the air, and
the hot air was rising, sucking air from all directions into the
city. Bornstein surmised what was happening next: As the warm air
rose, it cooled, condensing into clouds and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite images backed him up, revealing several instances in
which thunderstorms erupted over Atlanta, seemingly out of nowhere,
and dumped rain on the city, usually at its southeast and northeast
edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We documented all the steps in the sequence,'' Bornstein said.
In the satellite images, he said, ``you will not see any other
clouds upwind or downwind.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that cities generate their own heat, and alter their
climates as a result, is not new. Bornstein observed similar
thunderstorms appearing over New York City more than two decades
ago based on radar images, and other cities probably create their
own storms, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, scientists using high-tech sensors have
produced a more detailed picture of how human activities change the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, researchers from the NASA Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., have flown jets equipped
with infrared cameras over Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Calif.,
Baton Rouge, La., and Atlanta, producing block-by-block temperature
maps. Parks were cool _ plants are full of cooling water, and trees
also provide shade _ while asphalt parking lots were hot.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, the hottest buildings were often the
newest. In Salt Lake City, the Scott M. Matheson Courthouse, a
dark-roofed building that opened a couple of years ago, is a
white-hot splotch in the infrared photograph, suggesting a roof
temperature of about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Across the street to
the east, the century-old, castle-like City and County Building is
a relatively cool reddish color.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of universal air-conditioning, builders may have
focused more on durability and cost of roofs than on their ability
to absorb or reflect heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily think about making things cool because
everything is air-conditioned,'' said Dr. Dale Quattrochi, a senior
scientist at Marshall and co-leader of the NASA heat island
research.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the heat-island effect is growing with the outward
push of suburbia. For instance, Atlanta's urban heat island now
covers at least 17 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a semicultural mindset change.'' Quattrochi said. ``We
start paving over things and we start cutting down trees.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA team expects to turn its infrared cameras on Houston as
soon as next week, as part of a larger effort by Texas and federal
agencies to track the creation and spread of smog there. Hotter
temperatures speed the chemical reactions that create ozone, the
primary component of smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of things that's interesting about Houston is it is an
extremely large city in terms of the built-up area,'' Quattrochi
said. At 572 square miles, he said, ``It's going to be the largest
urban area we've studied to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other cities, Houston does not have zoning laws and its
industrial, commercial and residential buildings are all mixed
together. ``I think it's going to be very intriguing to see how the
overall pattern of the city affects heating and cooling,''
Quattrochi said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing data from the different cities, the NASA
researchers want to better understand how the heating effect
differs among different urban landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The heat-island effect was first recorded almost 200 years ago,
by Luke Howard, an amateur meteorologist in England. Beginning in
1807, he started collecting temperatures from several sites within
London with those measured a few miles beyond the city's edge, and
through the years, he noticed that the city was consistently
warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' Howard wrote in his book, ``The Climate of London'' in
1818, ``under the varying circumstances of different sites,
different instruments, and different positions of the latter, we
find London always warmer than the country, the average excess of
its temperature being 1.579 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the effect is more noticeable. In the largest cities,
average temperatures can range 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter
than surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides discomfort, the added heat also increases the need for
air-conditioning, which in turn contributes to other air quality
problems. The laboring air-conditioners consume more electricity,
which causes nonnuclear power plants to spew out more of the
chemical ingredients for the making of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   But once made, these effects can be unmade. In a 1998 study,
scientists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.,
concluded that residents and businesses in the New York City area
could cut their summertime air-conditioning costs by $22 million by
swapping dark roofs with more reflective ones. Outdoor summer
temperatures could also drop a couple of degrees.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the reflective roofs would raise heating
bills by $6 million in winter. ``In the wintertime, you want the
roof to be hot,'' said Steven Konopacki, staff research associate
at Lawrence Berkeley and a member of the heat island research
group. But the net savings would still be considerable: $16 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the benefits cascade. According the computer simulations, a
drop in temperature of a couple of degrees can reduce levels of
ozone ``on the order of 5 percent to 10 percent, sometimes up to 20
percent,'' said Dr. Haider Taha, a staff scientist at Lawrence
Berkeley. ``You slow down the cooking rate of smog.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Berkeley researchers are also working on making
lighter-colored asphalts and roof shingles that come in different
colors but that efficiently reflect infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that black roofs dominate the urban landscape
is that they cost less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheapest thing in the past has been these black asphalt
shingles,'' Konopacki said. ``Some bad habits have developed, at
least in the states.''
</P>
<P>
   But reduced electric bills could more than offset the initial
difference in price. One case study offered by Konopacki involved a
medical office building in Davis, Calif., that had a ``typical
commercial building roof,'' reflecting about 24 percent of the
sunlight that hit it. When the roof needed to be replaced in 1997,
the Berkeley researchers persuaded the building owner to use a
white roof that reflected 60 percent of the sunlight.
Air-conditioning costs dropped 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA and Berkeley researchers hope the data will catch the
attention of architects and builders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, that hasn't been part of their curriculum,''
said Dr. Jeff Luvall, who runs the NASA heat island research with
Quattrochi. ``They're looking at aesthetics and budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has revised its building code for commercial buildings
to encourage the use of reflective roofs, and counties around
Atlanta have passed or are considering ordinances to preserve
remaining trees. Fifty-three roofing products now carry the federal
Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star label, which
indicates that the roofs will reflect at least 65 percent of the
sunlight when new and at least 50 percent three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers of reflective roofing, like Craig Lease of the
Stockton Roofing Co. in California, include NASA images in their
sales materials. ``When you can back up your words with NASA
data,'' Lease said, ``people listen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James Varga, a pediatrician, has been in practice in Santa
Monica, Calif., for 21 years, enough time for a generation of
well-educated, middle- and upper-middle-class parents to have
visited his examination room with their children. His diagnosis of
those parents: ``Absolutely too permissive.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome, according to Dr. Varga, starts with sleep
problems, when the child is nine to 12 months old. Then come the
tantrums when the child is two or three. By adolescence, it is
drugs and alcohol. ``People are not setting limits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is almost certainly a prescription for trouble, experts
say. Parents may assume that a laissez-faire approach to child
raising will make youngsters relaxed, happy and independent. In
fact, children read flexibility and a willingness to negotiate as
inconsistency, and it makes them nervous. ``When discipline is
sacrificed for the 'palness' of the relationship, the child does
not feel safe,'' said Dr. Linda Rubinowitz, clinical psychologist
and director of the Family Institute at Northwestern University, in
Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the parents of today's parents, those strict
disciplinarians of the 1950s and early '60s, may have been right
all along: Father and mother did know best, many psychologists and
pediatricians say. But that style of parenting is as out of fashion
as last season's pants. Permissiveness fits better, particularly in
a world that seems much more threatening than it did a generation
ago. Daily life is so full of constraints that many parents are
reluctant to introduce more.
</P>
<P>
   Like fashion, permissiveness is primarily a function of
affluence, and the work schedule required to maintain it. Poorer
families aspire to discipline but often practice ``permissiveness
by default,'' Dr. Rubinowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're working on a lower socioeconomic scale, the intent
may be to set firm limits, but they end up being permissive because
of the complexity of life _ working so many jobs and handling
responsibilities on a personal level that a more affluent person
would farm out, like shopping or cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who can afford to choose are motivated by a number of
factors. Dr. Varga, the father of two daughters, ages 13 and 15,
blames a strong ``reaction formation'' in some adults who, trying
not to recapitulate their parents' authoritarian style, ``end up
lopsided the other way.'' In other words, baby boomers who entered
adulthood on a wave of rebellion continue to fight the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Varga cites parents who have proudly told him that they
smoked marijuana with their children. ``Most parents of teens today
have smoked pot, and they don't want to be hypocritical, so most of
them are very lenient,'' he said. ``But if parents don't have a
position, it's difficult for a kid to figure out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents abandon discipline because they want to enjoy the
little time they have to spend with their children. ``With working
mothers, there is definitely an issue of guilt,'' Dr. Varga said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rubinowitz said that single parents feel a similar pressure.
``The complexity of life and lifestyle is a constraining factor,''
she said. ``People feel, 'I just don't have the energy, I don't
want to have another fight, I have limits myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed adults take what Nancy Samalin, a parent educator in
New York City, believes is the path of least resistance. ``Parents
want their children to love them, and it's harder to say 'no' than
'yes,''' she explained, ``especially if you've been working all day
and you're tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology that makes the universe one big chat room can
also make it harder to converse at the dinner table. ``The nuclear
family used to have dinner and then perhaps watch a family program
on TV together,'' said Reveta Bowers, the head of school at the
Center for Early Education in Los Angeles, a private elementary
school where families include celebrities, dual-career couples and
those receiving financial aid. ``Now they all go off to their own
rooms, to the computer. Even the poorest families have TVs.''
</P>
<P>
   The autonomy that technology encourages has undermined the
family, Ms. Bowers said, noting, ``Everyone does what feels best
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Samalin and other experts say that children are
making too many decisions, often subsidized by money, which is
easier to hand out than attention.
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Mann is a middle-school teacher on Mercer Island, a
middle-class suburb of Seattle, Wash., and the mother of two
daughters, 13 and 11. Mrs. Mann said she was appalled when her
seventh-grade students circulated a petition challenging a school
dress code that forbade spaghetti-strap tops and dresses at a
dance. She has never let her daughters wear such revealing clothes.
What did it mean that her preteen students wanted them so badly?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think parents are involved,'' Mrs. Mann said. ``I
assume they just give the kids money to go shopping at the mall,
and they come home with clothes meant for older girls. The parents
think it's fashionable, and they think of themselves as hipper than
their parents were. So they don't institute rules.''
</P>
<P>
   She tells her own children that they cannot wear clothes that
``advertise'' a young body, ``and my girls go along with me because
I give them a reason.'' Which is that it's inappropriate for girls
to dress in such revealing styles.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of parents putting on the behavioral brakes,
schools are increasingly assuming the traditional parental role.
``Schools now make rules,'' Ms. Bowers said, ``which in many
instances are the only rules that are not open to arbitration or
negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``What children really need is guidance and love and
support. We expect them to act more and more like adults, while we
act more and more like children. Then, when we're ready to act like
parents, they bristle at the retaking of authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her students' families, permissiveness can become a
competitive sport. Indeed, two years ago, she sent out a note
asking people to tone down birthday parties. ``There's this formula
_ the rentals, the trained acts,'' Ms. Bowers said. ``It's how we
express our love, rather than putting our arms around them and
saying 'no' in a loving way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rubinowitz said that ``no'' is often the most loving thing a
parent can say. ``It gives the child a sense that you really
understand what's going on,'' she explained. ``And it gives the
child a way to deal with a problem in a social context. You can
tell them, 'Say your mom and dad won't let you do it, and grumble
if you want.' That's face-saving for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of a backlash among wealthier parents. Kathleen
Kennedy and Frank Marshall, film producers whose credits include
the Oscar-nominated ``Sixth Sense'' and ``E.T.,'' could underwrite
all manner of permissiveness with their two daughters, Lili, 3, and
Meghan, 15 months. But they have decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally designed the kids' rooms so we could put TVs in
them,'' Ms. Kennedy said. Instead, the television and computers
will be installed in a communal space in the house because, Ms.
Kennedy said, ``I want to know what they watch and have some
control; I'm a big believer in boundaries and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, as Ms. Kennedy sees it, is to figure out how to
be strict in a world that has far more rules than when she grew up.
``The seeds of my imagination and creativity came from the fact
that I could say, 'Hey, see you later,' and our parents didn't
worry about it,'' she said. ``They'd just say, 'Be home in time for
dinner,' and I'd be off on my bike. But today, you can't send your
kids riding their bikes in the canyon alone, because it isn't
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The old freedoms have become casualties of fear related to
teenage violence, drugs and alcohol; the sexual revolution that the
current generation of parents lived through now has life-or-death
consequences. Ms. Kennedy's children spend more time under adult
supervision than she ever did, and she wonders how children will
learn to be independent. ``Everything is so regimented now,'' she
said. As Dr. Rubinowitz said, ``This is the challenge for this
generation _ to find ways to enable a child to develop her own
judgment without a created structure around her, to find ways to
'work in' experiences that allow more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umbilical cord stretches,'' she concluded, ``but I do
think it's a harder world.''

   If there's one good thing about the rising cost of college
tuition, it's that it makes a private college counselor or an SAT
tutor seem cheap by comparison. You've probably heard about these
paid consultants who'll help your child search for the right
college and fill out the applications.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, students have been seeking outside help on at
least one aspect of their college applications _ the SAT and ACT,
the most widely used college-entrance exams. Today, they usually
turn to one of the two big test-preparation companies: Kaplan and
the Princeton Review.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board, which oversees the SAT, had long argued that
``coaching'' does not help students improve their scores. But in
1998, it published a study acknowledging that coaching can improve
scores on the test _ which has a maximum of 1600 points _ by about
twenty-five points. (Today, the Board itself sells books on test
prep.)
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and the Princeton Review say their studies show that, on
average, their courses improve students' scores by more than 100
points. The Princeton Review, in fact, promises to continue working
with students who don't improve their scores _ by at least 100
points _ absolutely free.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaplan and Princeton Review SAT preparation courses cost
about $700 to $900. Classes typically meet once a week for two to
three months. (Students who take an online course alone can cut
those costs nearly in half.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the test-prep business, private college counseling is
dominated by individuals, many of whom are former guidance
counselors or admissions officers. Their fees range from $500 to
$3,000, depending on the student's needs. Since there's virtually
no regulation of the industry, families are well advised to check
references before hiring anyone.
</P>
<P>
   You can also ask the guidance counselor at your child's school
for advice _ but be aware that the school counselor might be
offended. (``Isn't that my job?'' he/she might wonder, even though
the time this counselor can give each student is sometimes
minimal.)
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find an acceptable private counselor locally,
contact the Independent Educational Consultants Association in
Fairfax, Va. Its more than 300 members agree to abide by Principles
of Good Practice _ such as never accepting compensation from a
college for hyping it to students.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Review and California-based Achieva College Prep
Centers have begun creating national chains of private
college-counseling centers. Their prices are slightly lower than
those charged by independent consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring outside help is not without its critics. ``Students with
initiative can get for free a lot of what these very expensive
services are offering,'' contends Alice Kleeman, a college adviser
at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, Calif. But perhaps the
strongest argument against the practice is that admissions deans
are wary of consultants who provide too much help. An admissions
officer at Duke University says that she tosses aside applications
with essays that seem ``too polished'' (read: ghostwritten).

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a boy, our neighbors had the newest and latest of
everything,'' recalls Iowa collector Jim Daggs, author of ``A
Scrapbook of Fans'' (Ackley Pub. Co.; 1997; $25). ``I can still
remember the day they brought home an oscillating fan. Lying on
their living-room floor, I watched the fan turn back and forth,
listened to the whir of the motor and felt that gentle breeze.''
Similar nostalgic memories, Daggs theorizes, may be fueling the
current market for vintage electric fans, objects that have become
enormously popular with collectors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine surviving the dog days of summer without
the aid of an oscillating fan, but just a century ago these
warm-weather necessities were considered the latest in modern
technology and a luxury item beyond the reach of most Americans.
During the early decades of the 20th century, electric fans were
only used either in commercial establishments or in well-to-do
households. Early in the 1920s, however, industrial advances
allowed steel to be mass-produced in different shapes, making fans
more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to create a cooling, artificial breeze date back
hundreds of years, reports Scott MacClymonds, president of the
American Fan Collectors Assn., a 600-member club dedicated to the
preservation of fans and fan history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first recorded mechanical fan was the punkah fan used in
the Middle East sometime in the 1500s,'' he says. ``It consisted of
a canvas-covered frame that was suspended from the ceiling.
Servants known as punkah wallahs pulled a rope connected to the
frame to move the fan back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   As technology progressed, MacClymonds continues, fans followed
suit. Windup fans _ similar to windup clocks _ were popular in the
1700s. The Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s ushered in
belt-driven fans powered by factory waterwheels. Heat-convection
fans fueled by alcohol, oil, or kerosene were common around the
turn of the 20th century. But most of these fans faded away as the
use of electricity spread.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercially marketed electric fan was introduced in
1882 by the American firm Crocker &AMP; Curtis. In the years that
followed, manufacturers such as Emerson, General Electric,
Westinghouse, and Robbins &AMP; Myers competed to create the lightest
fan (early fans sometimes weighed as much as 40 pounds), as well as
the most economical operation and the strongest, quietest airflow.
</P>
<P>
   Developing aesthetically pleasing designs was another area
manufacturers explored. ``During the 1920s and early 1930s most
fans were black and fairly plain,'' Jim Daggs explains. ``But once
companies mastered quiet operation, they began to experiment with
design and color.''
</P>
<P>
   The first unique departure came in 1933, when Emerson designed
the Silver Swan, the first Art Deco fan. ``After that, fans became
decorative accessories for the home,'' Daggs says.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies followed Emerson's lead and marketed
Deco-inspired fans, characterized by fluid curves and clean,
uncluttered lines. But the Second World War interrupted Deco
design, as companies devoted time and materials to the war effort.
After the war and continuing into the 1950s, most companies
produced simple fans updated with bright colors such as aquamarine
and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of central air-conditioning in the 1960s brought an
end to the electric fan's golden age. Although fans are still
produced, the range of styles is far less wide than it once was.
``The variety and the quality of the old fans are what lure
collectors today,'' MacClymonds points out.
</P>
<P>
   To find these vintage pieces today, scour flea markets, garage
sales, antiques shops and online auctions. Models from the 1920s
and early 1930s are the most common and range in price from $20 to
$75. Pristine Art Deco fans command a higher price, about $50 to
$300, with examples like the Silver Swan fetching as much as $400
to $500. Colorful fans from the 1950s sell for $20 to $40.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a fan's condition, size, and age, factors that
affect price include the number of blades (a four-blade design is
the most common; five or six, more rare) and the materials from
which they are made (brass blades are the most desirable).
</P>
<P>
   Pieces in their original boxes are also highly prized as are
ones with working motors. Even if an old fan still runs, however,
MacClymonds suggests having its motor rewired by a professional:
``Although most old fans are safe and made to last, new wiring will
ensure a longer life for your collection.''

'THE WAR GENERATION' HAS SPECIAL PLACE IN HENRY FORD MUSEUM

<P>
   D-Day, Pearl Harbor, FDR, penicillin and Orson Welles' ``War Of
The Worlds'' radio broadcast. All of these were part of growing up
for the War generation, often referred to as the ``Greatest
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   They were raised during the desperation of the Depression and
grew up in the shadow of World War I, one of the most horrific wars
the world had ever seen. They went on to win World War II, and many
would fight again, and die, in the Korean War. To support the war
effort, they became the first recycling generation, turning tires
into gas masks, radiators into rifles and shovels into hand
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, with imminent threat of invasion by Hitler's
forces, this was a generation on edge, and not yet aware of the
power and deceptive verisimilitude of the media. So imagine the
terror one Sunday night when they switched on the radio and heard
these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I have
ever witnessed ... There, I can see the thing's body ... The mouth
is V-shaped with saliva dripping from its rimless lips...''
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles had struck! It was the 20th century's first virtual
alien experience: Orson Welles' 1938 Mercury Theater radio
broadcast of H.G. Wells' ``The War Of The Worlds.'' Members of the
War generation remember it well, either firsthand or from the
newspaper accounts of the panic it instigated in New Jersey and New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   That they believed Welles' news show drama was a reflection of
the national fear of invasion. It also signaled the power of radio,
a relatively new, live medium which, like its audience, was coming
into its own. And this generation had to learn fast and learn well,
often by making _ and then learning from _ mistakes. Their survival
depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   All of these issues, and more, are on display in the new exhibit
at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., called ``Your Place In
Time: 20th Century America.'' The exhibit covers the six
generations of Americans who came of age in the 20th century and
the people and events that shaped them. The second generation _ the
War generation _ and its accomplishments have received a lot of
long overdue attention recently. The exhibit brings that time in
history to life with photos, displays and interactive vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   A STAR IS BORN
</P>
<P>
   You may be a member of this generation if you recall that bad
times weren't so bad when you were at the movies _ one of the few
fantasy escapes available. Movies had been around for a while, but
were now improved with sound and, starting in 1935, color.
Hollywood stars were bigger than life _ even the child stars like
Shirley Temple and Judy Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Fan magazines became the cornerstone of the neighborhood
newsstand. In their pages, readers could gaze longingly at their
new pals Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Humphrey Bogart, or covet the
long lashes of leading ladies like Carole Lombard and Joan
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition, visitors can flip through Silver Screen
magazine. Some ads will look familiar _ Maybelline cosmetics,
LifeBuoy soap and Camel cigarettes, for example. Others may look
strange in light of today's trends _ for instance, one ad touts
``Dr. Walter's reducing brassiere that gives you that trim youthful
figure that the new styles demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio, like motion pictures, was a recently improved technology.
Youngsters of the War generation took to radio like today's kids
take to computers. Young people (they weren't called ``teens'' yet)
bought and built sets, broadcast their own messages and listened in
every night to regular shows like ``The Lone Ranger,''
``Amos'n'Andy'' and the ``Grand Ole Opry.'' Soap operas first
appeared as short radio vignettes, sponsored by, well, soap
companies, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of this generation who came of age in the late '30s
and '40s fought in World War II, while the younger ones assisted
their elders in holding down the home front. At home, Uncle Sam
asked for donations of old scrap of all types to make new items for
the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the exhibit shows that silk and nylon stockings
went into gunpowder bags. One old radiator made 17 .30-caliber
rifles, one old lawnmower reel equaled six 3-inch shells, and the
rubber for 12 gas masks came out of one old tire. One shovel could
make four hand grenades. And lard, the most common shortening of
the day, was collected to make explosives.
</P>
<P>
   They saw new materials, such as plastics and plywood, aluminum
and magnesium, make possible entirely new items like squeeze
bottles, aluminum foil, lightweight auto parts and architectural
elements, and new forms of furniture. After the war, aluminum was
applied to a couple of developments that would become essential to
modern life: beer kegs and aluminum siding.
</P>
<P>
   This generation saw the introduction of streamlined industrial
design, which began as a way to increase the aerodynamic efficiency
of cars and trains, but soon beautified telephones, radios and even
toasters, which in most homes don't travel very fast at all.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the exhibit's interactive vignettes, a decade-by-decade
showcase running the length of the exhibit features photos and
artifacts that speak to each generation (especially the ``tweens''
who, like some of us, fall between generations).
</P>
<P>
   Here we are reminded that the War generation saw the
not-so-long-ago miracle of penicillin, first made available as an
antibiotic during World War II. Along with artifacts, the
exhibition also showcases famous photos of troops embarking on
their fateful D-Day mission, and the mushroom cloud from the big
bomb that helped end the war.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a ride for these young people. They saw a lot, did
a lot, and no doubt later annoyed their boomer offspring with tales
of youthful hardships. Now mostly retired, they're finally getting
to enjoy some of the things they fought for. Youngsters, you should
listen to their stories. They were there. They saw some of the
greatest changes this world has ever known. In fact, we could all
learn a thing or two.

VIRTUAL TIBET: A MAGNET FOR EXPLORERS, SPIRITUALISTS AND THE
STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the centuries, Tibet has been mythologized in the Western
imagination as a magical, utopian realm. For 19th-century explorers
trying to scale the daunting peaks of the Himalayas, it was a kind
of alluring El Dorado _ one of the great unmapped places of the
world, a place whose very isolation endowed it with a frisson of
mystery and allure. For spiritualists like Alexandra David-Neel,
who journeyed to Lhasa in 1924, it was a fairy tale realm where
lamas practiced magic and astral projection. For readers of James
Hilton's 1933 novel ``Lost Horizon,'' Tibet was the inspiration for
the never-never land of Shangri-La, a refuge from a desperate
world, a paradise where nothing was wanting and no one ever grew
old.
</P>
<P>
   In his highly uneven new book, ``Virtual Tibet,'' Orville
Schell, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University
of California, Berkeley, and the author of several books on China,
attempts to assess the role that Tibet has played in the fantasy
life of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Although his chapters dealing with historical material have been
energetically researched and make for engaging reading, the
remainder of the book (detailing Hollywood's relationship with
Tibet) is flawed by strangely fuzzy thinking. There are inane
interviews with such ``Buddhists'' as Oliver Stone, the director of
``Natural Born Killers,'' and the action actor Steven Seagal, who
once played ``a CIA agent turned cop with a Buddhist bent.'' There
are also long, self-indulgent accounts of Schell's visits to the
movie set of ``Seven Years in Tibet,'' accounts that attempt to
draw strained analogies between the fantasies the public projects
on movie stars like Brad Pitt (the star of that movie) and the
fantasies it has projected on Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   It is Schell's thesis that Tibet's isolation and, for many
years, its inaccessibility turned it into a blank screen on which
Westerners could project their wildest imaginings. In the years
before air travel, the very difficulty of getting to the holy city
of Lhasa made it a challenge to explorers, while the reluctance of
Tibetans to welcome outsiders galvanized the urge of these
adventurers ``to transgress forbidden places.''
</P>
<P>
   As the West grew increasingly industrialized and embarked on two
world wars, Tibet also became a magnet for those weary of
civilization and its discontents: The country's spectacular
Himalayan vistas acquired a kind of religious significance, even as
the land came to fill the need of Westerners ``to imagine a
peaceful, spiritual, serene country, at once beautiful and
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Culling through the eclectic writings on Tibet left by
explorers, missionaries and spiritual pilgrims, Schell gives the
reader an entertaining account of the disparate Westerners who made
their way to Lhasa, or tried. We are introduced to Father Ippolito
Desideri, a Jesuit priest who arrived in Lhasa in 1716 after a
harrowing trip across the Himalayas and who left the first
comprehensive account by a Westerner of life in Tibet; Col. Nikolai
Mikhailovich Przhevalsky, a Russian explorer who embarked upon five
grueling and unsuccessful expeditions to reach Lhasa and eventually
died of typhus on the way; and Mr. and Mrs. St. George Littledale,
who set off from India in 1894 with their fox terrier, Tanny, and
came within 70 miles of their quest.
</P>
<P>
   Schell discusses the heroic efforts of such Indian cartographers
as Nain Singh and Sarat Chandra Das to map the wilderness of Tibet,
and recounts the efforts of eccentric spiritualists like Helena
Petrovna von Hahn _ aka Madame Blavatsky _ to promote Tibet as the
epicenter of a new spiritualism. ``The ensuing Western infatuation
with Tibet and its form of Buddhism was somewhat reminiscent of the
idealization of China by the physiocrats and philosophes during the
French Enlightenment,'' Schell writes. ``Only then, Europeans
admired China's practicality and rationality whereas now they
admired Tibet's propensity for the irrational and supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as Tibetans under Chinese rule have tried to
focus world attention on their plight, they have forsaken their
once willful isolation. The attention of Hollywood and New Age
seekers is welcomed, even cultivated, as is the attention of the
press. ``Like a river that has reversed its course,'' Schell
observes, ``Tibetans now desperately turn outward rather than
inward.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that such provocative historical analysis is
intercut in ``Virtual Tibet'' with long-winded chapters on the
making of the movie adaptation of ``Seven Years in Tibet'' that
read like outtakes from a hastily written magazine piece.
</P>
<P>
   Schell spends an enormous amount of space talking about his
negotiations with movie publicists to visit the set in Argentina,
where the Andes were used as a stand-in for the Himalayas. Worse,
he jokily compares his difficulties in gaining access to the movie
set to the hardships suffered by early adventurers trying to make
it across the Himalayas to Tibet. Elsewhere, in a discussion of
``Tibet's evolving mythology,'' he callously lumps together the old
Western myth of a ``paradisiacal Tibet'' with the current Western
view of the land as a spiritual society ``crushed under the
jackboot of an aggressive materialist overlord,'' as though both
notions were equally projections of ``the popular imagination of
the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such glibly tossed-off observations distract
attention from the more serious aspects of this book, and cast an
unnecessary shadow over Schell's more thoughtful observations.  &QL;

ONE MORE LEAP INTO THE CLINTON CESSPOOL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just what we needed _ another confession/apology from Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons known only to the self-indulgent, lame-duck penitent
in chief, President Clinton showed up at a ministers' conference in
Illinois and rehashed his oh-so-horrible feelings of guilt and
remorse regarding the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't specifically mention which ``terrible mistake'' he was
alluding to, but his oh-so-heartfelt remarks had the name ``Monica
Lewinsky'' written all over them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he specifically speak the words ``I'm sorry'' this time
around, but he defended a previous apology that some Americans
apparently found unconvincing:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I gave a clear, unambiguous, brutally frank and
frankly personally painful statement ... because I had to do it. I
mean, I finally realized that I was _ you know _ that I'd never be
all right unless I stood up there and said what I did, and said it
was wrong, and apologized for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that anyone who saw that, and who observed what
happened afterward, would not doubt that there had been a full and
adequate apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton previously apologized _ sort of _ six times, according
to a list published by the New York Daily News and distributed by
the Knight Ridder/Tribune news service.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``I'm sorry'' in at least one of the apologies, and in
another he said, ``I'm profoundly sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   You just can't be much sorrier than ``profoundly sorry,''
although I'd still like to hear him proclaim that he is
``oh-so-sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks caused a stir on a day when the only
other news had to do with self-destructing tires _ so much of a
stir, in fact, that Ted Koppel featured them on ``Nightline.'' Ted
asked ABC commentator/ex-Clinton confidant George Stephanopoulos
why Clinton would be talking about such things at this stage of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't help it,'' Stephanopoulos said. ``He can't stop
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the longtime compulsive philanderer has turned
into a compulsive apologizer?
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos, by the way, offered the opinion that Vice
President Al Gore and his campaign strategists could have lived
without Clinton's latest comments about the Lewinsky business.
Gore, after all, had just added Joe ``Moral Conscience of the
Senate'' Lieberman to the Democratic ticket in hopes of putting
some distance between himself and Clinton's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the one Democrat who denounced Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky as ``immoral'' way back when the
president was still trying to get away with calling it
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan seemed to be working until Clinton decided to walk
the path of repentance one more time. By reminding voters of
something that Gore would like them to forget, Clinton made life
more difficult for his would-be successor.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Clinton didn't make an effort to give
Gore some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is
good,'' Clinton said. ``And surely no fair-minded person would
blame him for any mistake that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't Clinton's mistakes that some Americans are blaming
on Gore. The vice president is being blamed to a certain degree for
his blind allegiance to Clinton _ and to a large degree for his own
actions as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted Cliff May, communications director
for the Republican National Committee:
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's personal foibles and failings have nothing to do
with the fact that Al Gore went to a Buddhist temple to raise money
and that his closest associates and fund-raisers were convicted of
multiple felonies in regard to that event.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gore has plenty to answer for in his own right
before anyone thinks about dragging him into Clinton's cesspool.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, well, he really ought to stop splashing.

CLUES TO DEADLY VIRUS FOUND IN FRUIT BATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Malaysia, Australia, Japan)   (Science Times)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Researchers in Malaysia have confirmed a link
between fruit bats and a recently discovered virus that killed more
than 100 people last year and compelled authorities to slaughter
roughly a million pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Kenneth Lam Sai Kit, a microbiology professor at the
University of Malaya, said his research team had successfully
isolated strains of the deadly Nipah virus in urine collected from
island flying foxes, one of the many species of fruit bats that
live throughout Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The finding confirms that the bats are carriers or reservoirs
for the virus, which last year crossed over to pigs and then to
humans. With no known vaccine or cure, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has put Nipah, which was named for one of
the villages it hit, in the same class of viruses as ebola and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists called Lam's findings a breakthrough in
understanding the virus and helping to prevent future outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important that Lam did find the virus,'' said
Dr. John S. Mackenzie, a professor of microbiology and parasitology
at Australia's University of Queensland and an expert on diseases
transmitted from animals to humans. ``The final proof requires that
you isolate the virus from the bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Lam's finding came just after an outbreak of Nipah in June in
northern Malaysia. Health authorities in northern Perak state
killed more than 1,700 hogs to prevent the disease from spreading
after a woman living nearby was found to have the virus.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains unclear exactly how the virus is transmitted
from fruit bats to pigs, numerous opportunities exist for the rare
crossover to occur, Lam said. Fruit trees in which bats forage for
food are often near pigsties, he said, and Malaysia's pig farmers
tend to live very close to their pigs. Malaysia is considering
measures to protect its $400-million-a-year pig farming industry,
which was crippled by last year's outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Nipah first appeared as a pandemic early last year when it hit
pig farms in Malaysia and slaughterhouses in nearby Singapore.
Health workers initially believed they were dealing with an
outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, which is transmitted from pigs
to humans by mosquitoes. The symptoms were similar: high fever,
aches and coma. Roughly four of every 10 sufferers died.
</P>
<P>
   Confounding this early diagnosis was the fact that some victims
had been inoculated against Japanese encephalitis and that most
lived near or worked on pig farms. The virus was also killing some
pigs, and Japanese encephalitis does not do that.
</P>
<P>
   After a Malaysian microbiologist isolated the virus from the
brain and spinal fluid of Nipah victims, scientists at the CDC
determined that it was not Japanese encephalitis but a new member
of a class of viruses called paramyxoviruses that includes mumps
and measles. Its closest relative, they found, was another virus
called Hendra discovered in 1994 after killing 14 horses and their
trainer in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hendra was carried by fruit bats, so researchers began searching
for a similar link in Nipah. Scientists from the CDC and from
Taiwan, Japan and Australia flew to Malaysia, scouring pig farms,
villages and trapping bats. Tissue samples from roughly 300 fruit
bats revealed antibodies against Nipah, ``but we were never able to
isolate the virus per se from any of our samples,'' said Dr. Hume
Field of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, who spent
six weeks in Malaysia looking for Nipah's source.
</P>
<P>
   With no new evidence a year later, Lam and his team set out to
search themselves. In early June, he said, they spent three nights
laying plastic sheets under trees full of flying foxes, collecting
urine samples. Back in the lab, they found strains of Nipah that
matched those recovered from humans.
</P>
<P>
   Though only just discovered, Nipah appeared to be a very old
virus, judging from how different it was in form, Field said. Like
ebola and AIDS, he said, it may have infected people on a much
smaller scale years before making headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will now need to determine what environmental
changes made Nipah so virulent. Lam said that only three of his
1,000-odd samples contained the virus, which indicated that bats
were by no means infested by the virus. Mackenzie, who researched
the Hendra virus' transmission from bats to horses and to humans,
said infections took place only under very rare circumstances,
usually by direct contact with infected blood. In Nipah's case, no
transmission between people appears to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've probably got is one spillover event where one
flying fox that was excreting virus came into contact with an
unfortunate pig that consumed either the discharge or the bat,''
Field said.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said that because Nipah can also be found in saliva, it was
possible that pigs may have caught the virus by eating fruit that
the bats had nibbled on.
</P>
<P>
   How the virus moves from pigs to humans remains unclear, but
researchers believe one possibility is that people breathe in
infected particles of saliva coughed up by Nipah-infected pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Lam's findings also raised concern about the possibility that
the bats, which are migratory, could carry the disease beyond
Malaysia. Southeast Asia is home to several species of fruit bat,
many of which are considered delicacies and have been hunted nearly
to extinction. In Malaysia, for example, fruit bats are now
protected by law.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said antibodies against Nipah had been found in other
species of fruit bat. Moreover, Nipah is also known to infect dogs,
cats and horses, presenting the possibility that pig farms may not
be the only venues for crossover.

<P>
   When I became president and COO of Harley-Davidson's motorcycle
division in 1987, the hard work of saving the company was done. We
had survived seven arduous years of crisis. But we faced an
altogether new challenge _ sustaining progress. How to do that?
</P>
<P>
   For me, the answer was clear. We needed to create an environment
where everyone at Harley took responsibility for the company and
its future. I believe that a leader should mind the interests of
all stakeholders, of course, but also be an outspoken advocate for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are hardwired, like me, to be a leader who shares
rather than exerts power, the command-and-control model is hard to
avoid. The top management job carries certain expectations on
behalf of employees, colleagues and the outside world. It takes
trust on the part of employees and discipline on the part of the
leader to push back on those traditional expectations and create a
company where everyone owns decisions and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVAL MODE
</P>
<P>
   My career with Harley-Davidson dates to August 1981 when I
joined as CFO, just two months after a group of 13 Harley managers
had bought the company from AMF in a leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson had a poor reputation for quality and
reliability, and it was behind the curve on product design and
development. Break-even points were high; market share was falling.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company faced tough competitors: Honda and
Yamaha. It's no wonder that in 1980, when AMF engaged an investment
bank to sell the division, it found no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Vaughn Beals, formerly AMF's group
executive for the Harley division and now chairman and CEO of
Harley-Davidson Inc., and the leadership team (of which I was
member) cut the overall workforce by 40 percent _ affecting
salaried and hourly workers. All remaining salaried employees
agreed to a 9 percent pay cut, frozen for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, it appeared that Beals and the team might pull
off a miracle. The company had introduced its Evolution Engine in
1984, and that, combined with the new Softail product line, began
to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   Harley was also having some success with special programs
started to help its dealers attract and retain customers. Important
improvements were made on the operating side of the business, and a
financial restructuring positioned the company to go public.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, the prognosis looked good. Manufacturing costs were
falling; reductions in in-process inventories and associated
carrying costs saved about $40 million a year. Our quality had
improved. Our dealer network was revitalized and growing. When we
went public in July, the offering raised $25 million more than the
underwriters had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ENGINES OF CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear the present was in good order, it was time to
think about the future. I didn't have a plan beyond knowing that
capturing the ideas of all the people at Harley was critical to our
future success.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gelb, then vice president of manufacturing, and John
Campbell, vice president of human resources, and I were meeting a
lot back then to talk about how to improve operations. One idea we
came up with was gain sharing _ a program to allow all employees to
share in the company's financial success. But organizational-change
consultants quickly explained that the gain-sharing program had
been created at the top and was about to be imposed from the top.
So much for inclusive leadership!
</P>
<P>
   GOOD INTENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We explored several other ideas and posed many questions: How
does constant crisis management affect a workforce? How _ in the
absence of a crisis _ can we create an environment where employees
care about the company on a personal level and work together to
improve individual and overall performance?
</P>
<P>
   One consultant, Lee Ozley, talked a lot about the psychologist
Abraham Maslow. Maslow had a theory that absent a crisis, people
rarely commit to a program imposed on them. But they will willingly
commit to a program they help create. That thought made a huge
impression on me. In late 1988, we agreed to start a series of
programs intended to elicit ideas from our employees.
</P>
<P>
   First we approached the union leadership of the roughly 700
employees in the Wisconsin operations and asked them to help us
create a vision for the business. Ozley had warned us that it would
take 12 to 18 months to prepare people for such a process. But I
decided we couldn't wait. I wanted a new labor-management
relationship approved before our union contracts expired, in three
months.
</P>
<P>
   We were able to put in place one-year contracts with each local
union that included the joint vision-building process. Over the
next several months, many people in the Wisconsin operations worked
hard to craft a joint vision. First, about 70 leaders, union and
management, wrote down ideas for what Harley should become. Then a
facilitator met with them in groups to build consensus. Finally,
all 70 people met for three days to forge a shared strategic vision
for Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   When we rolled the ideas out to the rest of the company _ an
audience mainly of salaried employees _ one asked, ``Who
represented us in this process?''
</P>
<P>
   I was ashamed. Once again, we had behaved like traditional
managers by not including everyone. But we quickly set up two
groups of salaried employees to share the making the vision work.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our leaders weren't prepared to implement the
dramatic change the plan called for. In fact, the implementation
came off like a forced march, sending mixed messages and causing
confusion on both the shop floor and in the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the largest local union opted out of the
process after two years. Although the joint visioning process did
not succeed as we had hoped, it laid the groundwork for shared
leadership agreements with the unions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES RICH WANT?
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989, I became CEO. I soon decided that it was time to
bring together the company's 60 senior executives at an offsite
meeting. I wanted them to get to know one another and begin to work
as a truly unified team.
</P>
<P>
   We developed a program featuring two expert speakers on the
issue of change and one outside CEO who had led a major change
effort. After the presentations, we broke into smaller
cross-divisional, divisional, functional and cross-functional
groups to talk about what we'd heard, what we thought we could
accomplish and how we could do it. I visited each cluster with the
speaker so people could ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   On many easels that groups were using to record their ideas, I
was dismayed to notice the question ``What does Rich want?'' I
thought we had been so clear that the point was not to figure out
what I wanted but to figure out what everyone wanted for the
company. At the closing session, I let loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution, and I'm not going to lead it,'' I said.
``You need to lead it.''
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to the office on Monday, a colleague was waiting
for me. ``You know, you really stuck a pin in our balloon at that
session,'' she said. ``We were doing fine. We were getting to know
one another, expressing our fears as well as our thoughts about
what we wanted for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And then I realized my mistake. What was important were their
expectations. And they were happy. Too frequently, we as leaders
try to satisfy ourselves rather than others.
</P>
<P>
   The second session went well. By the third, we had jettisoned
our facilitators _ as had been the plan _ and took responsibility
to teach one another instead of listening to the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ONGOING PROCESS
</P>
<P>
   I retired as Harley's CEO in 1999, and I now serve on its board.
Looking back, I believe I succeeded in my journey to be a different
kind of leader. Harley's culture has changed, but the work is not
done.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming a culture takes time. Everybody hasn't fully bought
in to the inclusive approach. We still have people who think they
know all the answers, but they are getting fewer in number. We
still have people who just want to bring their bodies, and not
their minds, to work. But their ranks, too, are dwindling, too.
</P>
<P>
   We've been transforming ourselves since the buyout and will
still be at it 10 years from now. It is a journey that will never
end unless we let it.

<P>
   Many buyers on the Internet routinely use shopbots _ software
agents that automatically canvass the Internet looking for the
cheapest price for a given product.
</P>
<P>
   Now e-businesses are deploying agents of their own. For example,
the online retailer Buy.com is reportedly using price-comparison
software that automatically adjusts its prices to undercut
competitors' prices.
</P>
<P>
   But if all online sellers deploy armies of such pricebots, would
the result be self-destructive cyber price wars and digital mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hardly moot. Within the next decade, the
Internet could be populated with billions of software agents
exchanging information goods and services with one another and with
people.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, numerous computer
simulations have been run to explore how an agent-based economy
might function. The findings derived from those simulations raise
profound questions about the way businesses _ and the entire
economy _ will operate in the future. As commerce increases on the
Internet, a company's success may be determined as much by its
skill in programming its bots as by the wisdom of its business
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   One simulation model investigates how software agents might set
the prices of a commodity, such as a computer memory chip or a copy
of John Grisham's latest novel. Using the model, the behavior of a
variety of pricebots with different levels of sophistication was
studied.
</P>
<P>
   One simple bot, for example, uses trial and error to raise or
lower prices incrementally in an effort to maximize profits. A more
sophisticated agent makes pricing decisions based on detailed
information about competitors' prices and buyers' price
sensitivity, use of shopbots and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   With this copious information, the pricebot applies a short-term
optimization approach (dubbed ``myoptimal'' for myopically
optimal), and calculates the price that will maximize profits under
the assumption that competitors' prices remain fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the models are somewhat idealized and focus on only
about a half-dozen pricebot strategies, the results raise
provocative issues. If all pricebots rely on the trial-and-error
strategy, their collective behavior will evolve toward tacit
collusion in which they each maintain high prices and healthy
profits. If one of the pricebots adopts the myoptimal strategy,
however, it will garner higher profits at the expense of the
trial-and-error agents.
</P>
<P>
   But if all the pricebots make the switch, then endless price
wars ensue. The bots continually undercut one another until the
price reaches a certain lower limit, at which point they
re-establish a higher price, touching off a new round of
undercutting. Each pricebot actually fares worse than if all had
just maintained a trial-and-error approach.
</P>
<P>
   When all the agents are myoptimal, the one with the most
up-to-date information on competitors' pricing reaps the greatest
profits. Companies would therefore be highly motivated to program
their bots to scan competing sites and databases constantly, with
the advantage going to the fastest and most relentless repricers.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, suppliers' Web sites could be overwhelmed by
price queries from competitors' pricebots _ and the entire Internet
could be gridlocked.
</P>
<P>
   To deter such abuse, sellers may have no choice but to charge
pricebots (and shopbots) for price information. This possibility
hints at a powerful principle that could govern an agent-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that information goods and services are neither
overused nor underprovided, shopbots and pricebots may evolve into
full-fledged economic agents functioning as buyers, sellers and
intermediaries to facilitate all facets of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, researchers at the Watson Center have begun to
investigate how companies might avoid destructive bot wars by
developing more intelligent pricebots that can adapt to their
environment and anticipate the future. One promising approach is
based on reinforcement learning, in which agents learn optimal
pricing policies that maximize long-term profits. These
forward-looking pricebots have outperformed trial-and-error and
myoptimal agents.
</P>
<P>
   And when two forward-looking pricebots compete against each
other, they refrain from excessive undercutting because they
anticipate retaliation. Future research will investigate how larger
communities of such agents would perform against one other.
</P>
<P>
   Also of great interest is the behavior of agent-based markets
for complex products. Various models have been developed in which
sellers' bots not only set prices but also determine product
quality or configuration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bot could be used to create different versions of
an online journal, each with a unique set of articles, and to
adjust prices accordingly _ all in response to customers' demand
patterns and competitors' actions. Preliminary results reveal
several possible scenarios, including complicated cycles in which
both price and product parameters oscillate indefinitely _ an
undesirable situation for both sellers and buyers.
</P>
<P>
   To compete effectively on the Web, businesses will need to
understand the market dynamics of large communities of software
agents. Companies can use simulation studies to develop mechanisms
and strategies that will help them avoid potential pitfalls such as
price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligently designed bots can help businesses capitalize on
(and create) a flurry of information goods and services that will
rise as quickly and pervasively as the growth of the Web _ and that
will affect the world even more profoundly.
</P>

<P>
   SARDIS, Turkey _ After first light, though not by much, the
encampment of archaeologists wakes to the cooing of doves in the
pines, the barking of dogs and the early call to prayer from a
mosque down the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, some 20 professors and students straggling into the
dining room, has hot tea, bread and cheese and some fruit. By 7
a.m., they scatter to their pottery shards and marble inscriptions
in the laboratory, to the trenches into the scant remains of the
city of a famously rich king, Croesus of Lydia, who lived more than
2,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They work in the intense heat till noon. Back at the compound
called excavation house, spartan but old-shoe comfortable, they
lunch and rest, and it is off again at two o'clock to their tasks.
The day's work ends around five, in time for tea and chatter about
this or that spadeful of triumph or mystery. A visitor is
interrogated about news from home, mostly important things like
baseball standings.
</P>
<P>
   After showers (only cold) and a change into fresh shorts and
T-shirts, everyone relaxes, reading or recording notes on the day.
Dusk brings a gentle breeze and the cocktail hour, followed by
dinner at nine, about an hour or two before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   This daily rhythm of a summer's dig by the Harvard-Cornell
Sardis Expedition has been repeated with little variation since
1958. Some archaeologists and their students come and go. But the
continuity is maintained in part because so many of them, who cut
their teeth on archaeology here, keep coming back. It has become a
professional home, and the search for Croesus a consuming passion.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, Dr. Crawford H. Greenewalt Jr., the expedition's
field director, looks down the table like a paterfamilias and sees
three generations of the Sardis family _ his own, former students
who are now professors themselves and a new crop of aspiring
archaeologists. Few archaeology projects last so long.
</P>
<P>
   Greenewalt and Dr. Andrew Ramage, the associate director, are
the first generation. They were students at Harvard when Dr. George
M. A. Hanfmann, a professor there, started the first excavations 42
years ago. Now Greenewalt, who succeeded Hanfmann in 1977, is a
professor of classical archaeology at the University of California
at Berkeley. Ramage is an archaeologist at Cornell. Students they
trained years ago have become senior archaeologists for the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Geenewalt motions toward Dr. Nicholas Cahill of the University
of Wisconsin, one of his students who kept coming back and is now
in charge of excavations of the Lydian city wall. Another student,
Dr. Christopher Ratte of New York University, worked the site for
many seasons and has moved on to direct excavations at Aphrodisias,
a Greco-Roman site in western Turkey. He paid a visit one
afternoon, and it was like a family reunion, the exchange of news
and the baby pictures passed around.
</P>
<P>
   Younger faces at the dinner table belong to the third generation
in the Sardis genealogy. Elizabeth Baughan, a doctoral student at
Berkeley, is digging through pavements of a Roman road in search of
another stretch of the more deeply buried Lydian wall. Christopher
Roosevelt, working for his doctorate at Cornell, is excavating the
city's eastern wall and developing computer programs for plotting
settlement patterns in ancient Lydia beyond Sardis.
</P>
<P>
   Ramage says this kind of continuity may be passing from
archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sort of large-scale projects that run for years are not
easily funded,'' he explains. ``It is much less frequent that
people come to a site and become so thoroughly immersed. The
practice now is to conduct more targeted work with limited
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Looming behind the excavation house, some 1,000 feet above the
rest of Sardis, is the acropolis, a mountaintop citadel of Croesus
and subsequent rulers. Alexander the Great once stood there for a
view of the city he had won without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Sullivan, a geographer at the University of Denver,
goes there often to survey the valley looking for mounds or subtle
changes in vegetation, anything hinting at likely places for new
exploration. In particular, he is looking for evidence that the
ancient Hermus River once flowed closer to the Lydian capital. He
then takes cores in the valley, plots them on a map and finds that,
indeed, the river once flowed nearer to the city walls.
</P>
<P>
   The climb to the acropolis summit is literally and figuratively
breathtaking. Amid the crumbling ramparts and limestone terraces,
Sullivan recalls that he has returned to Sardis for 10 seasons, and
will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us spent our graduate-school years here,'' he says.
``That's a pretty formative time. It's hard to break the spell, so
we keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fikret Yegui, a Turkish-born professor of art and
architectural history at the University of California at Santa
Barbara, has worked at Sardis over the last 36 years. He is
preparing a detailed drawing of the beautiful Temple of Artemis,
stone by stone, every crack and mason's mark. When drawing is
completed, soon, the sheets, fitted together, will be 22 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner one evening, some of the archaeologists walked
through the temple's marble ruins and stood, transfixed, as a full
moon rose over the acropolis and cast its soft light on the temple
columns that still stood after 2,300 years.
</P>
<P>
   The day is complete. The encampment at Sardis falls asleep to a
distant dog bark and the last call to prayer from the mosque down
the valley.

FORMER KANSAS CITY FOOTBALL PLAYER PLEADS GUILTY IN MARIJUANA
SMUGGLING SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Former Kansas City Chiefs running back Bam
Morris pleaded guilty Monday, on the morning his trial was to
begin, to joining a former teammate in a $40,000 marijuana
smuggling scheme in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 28, acknowledged working with former Chiefs kick
returner Tamarick Vanover, former college friend Dewayne Calvin
Bryant and Robert Corey Myers of Warrensburg to transport the
marijuana from Texas to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover already has pleaded guilty to federal stolen car
charges, while Bryant and Myers confessed to their roles in the
marijuana conspiracy earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morris' plea agreement, he has agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors in an ongoing investigation. Preliminary estimates
in the plea agreement says he could face as many as 63 months in
federal prison because of his convictions in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   His guilty plea also triggers a probation violation for a
previous drug conviction in the state of Texas, where authorities
have said he could face as much as 10 more years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' lawyer, William Rork of Topeka, Kan., said the
possibility of an even higher federal sentence had Morris lost at
trial was a factor in his client's decision to plead guilty.

JFK'S SPIRIT PERVADES DEMOCRATS' CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This city has changed drastically since John
Fitzgerald Kennedy stood on the podium in the old Memorial Coliseum
here to accept his party's nomination for president and to tell
Americans about his vision of a ``New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that LA is bigger, smoggier and even more
culturally diverse, but its sparkling new skyscrapers _ once
forbidden for fear of earthquakes _ are testimony to the city's
confidence, if not arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kennedy's nomination in 1960, Los Angeles has endured and
withstood earthquakes, fires, mudslides and some of the worst
rioting in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its periodic setbacks, it is still regarded by many as
the ``city of the future.'' That's one of the reasons Democrats
wanted to come back here for the first time in 40 years, hoping to
focus the nation's attention more on what will be than what has
been.
</P>
<P>
   And the spirit of John Kennedy will be here throughout the next
four days. There is no way to avoid it, not than any Democrat would
want to.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Kennedy family will take center stage here this
week. The president's lone surviving brother, Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D.-Mass., and his only surviving child, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, will speak Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Their very presence will remind us not only of the late
president's life and death, but the death a year ago of his son,
who had captured the heart of America.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who, as a teen-ager, was literally touched by
President Kennedy, will undoubtedly borrow one of Kennedy's themes
in that 1960 convention address, by saying that the Republican
nominees want to hang on to the past while Vice President Al Gore
and running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman are the best choices for
leading America into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech 40 years ago, Kennedy felt compelled to talk
about his faith, admitting that many would see nominating a Roman
Catholic ``as a new and hazardous risk _ new, at least since 1928''
when Catholic candidate Al Smith was soundly defeated. In his case,
Kennedy felt that his party had put its faith, not in polls, but in
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear similar sentiments expressed from the
futuristic-looking stage here this week, as speakers talk about the
historic nature of Lieberman's selection as the first Jew on a
major party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Gore and Lieberman were greatly influenced by
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore was only 12 years old when Kennedy was nominated
for president, as the son of a Southern senator, he was keenly
aware of the Kennedy administration's effect in breaking down the
barrier of segregation. Later, he would see his father defeated for
re-election primarily because the elder Gore had voted for the
Voting Rights Act of 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the year Kennedy was assassinated, Lieberman spent time
in the South helping to register blacks to vote. The next year, he
attended his first Democratic National Convention, holding fast to
the spirit of the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' goal in 1960 was to recapture the White House
after Republicans had held it for eight years. The goal this year
is to keep it after having occupied it for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they will need the spirit of Kennedy and will have
to convince voters of something that Kennedy said in that
acceptance speech four decades ago: ``For courage _ not complacency
_ is our need today; leadership _ not salesmanship.''

ACUPUNCTURE HELPS SOME QUELL NEED FOR COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acupuncture appears to help some cocaine addicts escape their
dependence on the drug, according to a report published Tuesday by
researchers at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on drug abuse say cocaine addiction is one of the most
difficult forms of drug dependency to treat. And while many
treatment centers have been using acupuncture for some time,
usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of
its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yale study, 53.8 percent of the subjects who had needles
inserted in four acupuncture ``zones'' in the ear five times a week
tested free of cocaine at the end of the eight-week study period.
In comparison, 23.5 percent of control subjects given ``sham''
acupuncture treatments and 9.1 percent of subjects who watched
relaxation videos tested free of the drug during the final week of
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report appears in the August issue of the journal Archives
of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 82 men and women in the New Haven area who
were addicted to both heroin and cocaine. They were receiving
methadone treatment for the heroin addiction but were still using
cocaine regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the subjects, however, were dropped from the study
after missing sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers called the findings promising but cautioned that
the study was relatively small and that more research needed to be
done to confirm the results.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that acupuncture was not a panacea and suggested
that it should be used along with other therapies like counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are a difficult group of people to deal with,'' said Dr.
Herbert Kleber, the medical director of the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York and a professor of
psychiatry at Columbia University, who is familiar with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have medicine for treating cocaine addiction, and
acupuncture appears to be a useful adjunct for decreasing
dependence,'' Kleber said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Margolin, a research scientist in the department of
psychiatry at Yale's medical school and lead author of the report,
said that among the benefits of acupuncture were its low cost and
lack of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike pharmaceutical treatments, Margolin said, it can be
offered to pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings are also encouraging, he added, because
``they suggest that with the proper groundwork we can conduct
rigorous trials of complementary or alternative therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle that has confronted researchers trying to determine
whether acupuncture works has been the difficulty of finding
convincing ``placebo'' treatments to act as scientific controls.
For the sham needle treatment, the Yale researchers inserted four
needles along the rim of the ear, in spots that are not commonly
used in acupuncture treatment and had little effect when stimulated
in preliminary tests. The relaxation tapes were used to control for
the possibility that simply sitting quietly for 45 minutes in a
darkened room might itself produce an effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the acupuncture treatment, the needles were inserted five
times a week for about 45 minutes per session, according to
guidelines developed at Lincoln Hospital in New York, and adopted
by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association.
</P>
<P>
   Urine samples were taken three times a week to test for cocaine
use. All the subjects in the study, which was financed by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, also received psychotherapy as
part of the treatment program.
</P>
<P>
   Margolin said that scientists did not yet understand how
acupuncture might work to curb addiction but that there were a
variety of theories. For example, acupuncture has been linked to
the release of opioids, the body's natural painkillers, which might
help reduce the craving for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Or the procedure might stimulate the vagus nerve that runs
through the center of the ear, producing a relaxing effect.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese medicine, Margolin added, the stimulation points used
in the study are associated with a diagnosis called ``empty fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty good either metaphorical or literal
description of a cocaine-addicted individual,'' he said.

would beg of you, please forget that little soiree four years ago
out at a suburban Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the money is flowing this week, on top of $3
million already donated to political campaigns from residents of a
single ZIP code: Beverly Hills 90210.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more money here than I ever imagined,'' said K.C.
Sorber, manager at the new Reata on Rodeo Drive, a Tinseltown
spinoff of the popular Fort Worth restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Democratic National Convention is in Los Angeles
this week: to score money. Beverly Hills' money is going to Gore in
a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you hear around here is Gore,'' said Richard Clark of the
elegant Menage a Trois salon, where store workers once included a
Beverly Hills teen-ager named Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody in Beverly Hills ever gave money to a Republican _
they'd never say so.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of convention week and what amounts to a four-day
political rally, Gore needs more money for his presidential
campaign, and Beverly Hills is the best place to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, music executive David Geffen and moviemakers Steven
Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg tossed a little party for Gore and
President Clinton. Among the guests: Whoopi Goldberg, Sarah
McLachlan, Kevin Spacey and even comedian Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest ticket: $25,000. The total: $2.8 million for
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   That's a movie matinee special compared with Monday's Clinton
brunch at Barbra Streisand's house, where the money from the
$100,000-a-couple event is earmarked for the Bill Clinton
Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democratic campaigners were quoted in Friday newspapers
grumbling because both Clintons, Bill and New York Senate candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton, are here raising $18 million this weekend.
The problem isn't that the Clintons are stealing too much attention
here. They're getting too much money.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the most creative protest group this week is a Boston
comedy troupe called Billionaires for Bush (or Gore). Dressed in
tuxedos, gowns and jewels, the fake ``billionaires'' gathered at
The Gap in Santa Monica Sunday night to begin a week of protests
against big money in both parties, to culminate with Tuesday's
satirical Million Billionaire March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel fortunate that billionaires now have so much clout in
American politics,'' said Billionaire character ``Robin U. Blind,''
27, of Boston. Out of costume, she is protester-spokeswoman Dara
Silverman of United for a Fair Economy, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my money the old-fashioned way _ I was born into it,''
the fake billionaire said sarcastically. ``However, I do appreciate
that so many of the new billionaires in music and entertainment are
free to use their money to influence the government, just as in any
other industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in LA, the loony left of California is in full flower.
Other enlightening events this week, as listed in the Orange County
newspaper OC Weekly, include:
</P>
<P>
   _Community Convergence: ``The Direct Action Network prepares you
to protest the Democratic Convention'' with training in
``nonviolent direct action ... legal and jail solidarity, first
aid.''
</P>
<P>
   _People's Convention Los Angeles 2000: ``Jam-packed'' with
workshops covering ``police/prison reform, homelessness, labor
struggles, universal health care, ecology and more; a keynote
address by union activist Sabina Virgo; plus music, comedy, food
and networking.''
</P>
<P>
   _Los Angeles Sweatshop Tours: A ``guided reality tour'' of
garment shops by a bookstore named Libros Revoluci''n.
</P>
<P>
   _Mothers' Convention on Welfare: ``Welfare mothers, community
leaders and activists meet.''
</P>
<P>
   _National Homeless Convention: ``Speeches, panel talks, strategy
sessions, rallies, marches, candlelight vigils, concerts and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   _Celebration of Democracy and March for Workers Rights: ``Bring
instruments, kites and banners.''
</P>
<P>
   _Pre-Protest Kick-Off Party and Rally: ``A healthy dose of
raucous rock from the appropriately titled World Liberators.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have it all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If they were smart, they wouldn't be out marching. They'd be
throwing fund-raisers in Beverly Hills.

FLOCKHART SPEAKS OUT ON WEIGHTY ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose if I cared how much ``Ally McBeal'' star Calista
Flockhart weighed, I might be inclined to write about it. However,
I don't, so I won't.
</P>
<P>
   If the rumors about Flockhart's alleged love affair with Garry
Shandling kept me up at nights (yawn), I'd probably (not) consider
writing about that, too. But since I've been getting plenty of
sleep, there's no need to waste precious newsprint on that, either.
</P>
<P>
   And, like many other critics, I think ``Ally McBeal'' is in dire
need of artificial resuscitation, but even that isn't enough for me
to pull out the old laptop and rag on some fictional character.
</P>
<P>
   I have, however, dug up some dirt on the 35-year-old Illinois
native. The girl's got heart.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Flockhart traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, to do what
she could to help end violence against women worldwide. This issue
is particularly important in Kenya and other African countries
because one of the most horrific offenses against African girls and
women is female genital mutilation (female circumcision). According
to Amnesty International, at least 32 percent of Kenyan women
between the ages of 4 and 12 have had part of their clitoris
removed by rudimentary circumcisions performed without anesthesia
or proper surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this cultural, yet horrendous, ritualistic act
affect women physically and psychologically, it's also killing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what ritual it is. If people are dying, then
it's just wrong and it's time to change it,'' Flockhart said
emphatically during a Fox network party in the Hollywood Hills.
``Most of the people in Nairobi, once they become educated, they
acknowledge that this ritual is a mistake. Education is key.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the reasons Flockhart felt compelled to spend part
of her hiatus in a Third World country. The other is very noble,
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went, I felt a bit presumptuous _ like who am I
to go there _ but as a woman I feel I am entitled to do that. Women
should be helping women all around the world. We all have to stick
together, and we all have to end violence against women in every
way, shape and form. And the only way we're going to do that is to
bond together.''
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that when I approached Flockhart, who was dressed
in a clingy black and silver shirt and pants outfit, I never
imagined our conversation would go beyond that mindless exchange
that usually transpires between celebrities and reporters at these
``command performance'' events. Example:
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``So what have you been up to lately?''
</P>
<P>
   Celeb: ``Oh, we've been looking at some things, but I really
can't talk about them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: (thinking, Who is this `we'?) ``OK. So can you talk
about the direction your character is taking on the show?''
</P>
<P>
   Celeb: ``Oh, well, she's blah, blah, blah. And blah, blah, blah
(brief exchange of air kisses with some Vince Vaughn look-alike)
blah, blah.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, there was none of that between Flockhart and me.
Sure, we talked about ``Ally McBeal'' _ she thinks the show is
still quite good and had nothing but praise for her boss, David E.
Kelley. Also, there was some minor chitchat about how much she
missed Gil Bellows (his Billy character died last season) and about
the downside of fame _ she wouldn't wish ``the bad parts of it'' on
her worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of our conversation, however, was about our recent
experiences in Kenya. We were there at the same time, but had
different agendas. And although Flockhart and I are about as
different as Ally and Ling are, for that moment in time we were as
close as sisters.
</P>
<P>
   There's something surreal that happens to you when you
experience despair and devastation up close and personal. It is
impossible not to be deeply affected by the famine, the AIDS
epidemic and, yes, the female genital mutilation issues in eastern
Africa. Whatever emotional baggage you arrived with definitely
won't clear customs on your way home, because every problem you had
will seem no larger than a pinhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to articulate what it did to me,''
Flockhart said. ``It's probably something I'm never going to be
able to articulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time in the slums of Nairobi, and it put
things into perspective very quickly,'' Flockhart said. ``But what
I really loved most about Africa was the people. They don't have a
lot and they're happy. I didn't know how they were going to react
to me, but they were warm and embraced us. The women of Africa were
especially inspiring. They hold everything together. They have the
wood on their backs, their babies under their arms, and they take
care of and hold the communities together.''
</P>
<P>
   As emotionally draining as that experience was for Flockhart,
however, there were some ``Ally'' moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time talking to the women of the Masai tribe,
and the funniest thing a woman said to me is that she had walked
about three hours to get to the meeting that we were having. She
suddenly got up and said, `I have to get home; I have to beat the
elephant traffic.'''
</P>
<P>
   We all have our priorities.
</P>
<P>
   What I found most appealing about Flockhart, however, is that
she doesn't presume to be anything more than what she is. She's
just an actor, albeit a very good one. She knows the world will not
be a better place if she goes on a
Big Mac binge. She realizes that even if she did expose the truth
about her private life, there would still be starving people all
over the world. And although her fans might have difficulty
separating Flockhart from Ally, neither of them can bring an end to
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   She's done what she can do to affect change. She lent her name
to a worthy cause, and it did make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, has her priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to realize that you can really make a difference in
the world if you use your fame in the right way,'' Flockhart said.
``And what I've learned is that as a celebrity, you have some
power, you have some status and people will listen. So if you find
what you're passionate about and talk about it, you can raise
public awareness. It's important to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is. But watch out for those elephants, girlfriend.

BACK-TO-SCHOOL TRAVEL DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a standing-room-only Amtrak train from New England to New
York, I recently found myself nose to chest with a passenger
wearing a Hosteling International card on a lanyard around his
neck. The lavaliere reminded me that youth migrations are upon us,
as students flock back to college.
</P>
<P>
   Like senior citizens, students are a group that transportation
companies want to attract, hoping that they will fill seats at
times that business travelers do not: Saturdays, for example, or
Tuesday mornings. AirTran, a discount airline with a hip
conversational Web page for youth standby travel,
www.airtran.com/deals, delineates the week with its Best Days to
Fly Standby chart. Its message:
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: No Way
</P>
<P>
   Monday: Way
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: Most Excellent
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Most Excellent
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Not Quite Excellent
</P>
<P>
   Friday: No Way
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Somewhat Excellent
</P>
<P>
   AirTran serves 31 cities using DC-9 and 737 jets. Most of its
service is east of the Mississippi. The standby plan, in operation
two years, is simple. Anyone age 18 to 22, student or not, can fly
standby for $47 a segment _ a flight with one takeoff and one
landing _ whenever there are seats, but never on Friday, Sunday or
holidays, including Labor Day weekend and Thanksgiving. Tax and
airport charges of up to $5.50 are extra. A driver's license or
similar official photo ID must be presented, and payment may be
made by cash or credit card. AirTran's current program expires Dec.
14; if it follows last year's pattern, it will resume in January, a
system that avoids what would be a long blackout, according to
Sarah Duffin, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   There are two drawbacks: Almost all AirTran flights go through
Atlanta, so getting from New York to Chicago is going to take two
segments and quite a while. In addition, standbys cannot check
luggage, so everything must be carried on. AirTran: (800) 247-8726.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines also has a basic plan, although not for
standbys. It requires putting money up ahead of time. It sells
Travel Pak coupons to students age 14 to 24 that are similar to
senior books. A book, which costs $548, has four coupons, each good
for a one-way flight in the lower 48 states, or from there to
certain Caribbean and Canadian cities; most trips go through St.
Louis. Segment taxes and airport charges are not included in the
price. Two coupons are needed each way for Hawaii or Alaska. The
coupons are good for a year but not after the holder's 25th
birthday; student identification and proof of age are required at
the time of travel. TWA: (800) 221-2000; www.twa.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Shuttle sells travelers 12 to 24 years old (as well as
those over 62) packs of four coupons for the heavily collegiate
Boston-New York-Washington corridor. The hours of use are
restricted: Travel is permitted only between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30
p.m. or 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Monday to Friday, or anytime on Saturday
and Sunday. Coupons for the short trips (Logan-La Guardia or La
Guardia-Reagan) cost $232 for four or $413 for eight. For
Logan-Reagan, the cost is $353 for four, $598 for eight. The prices
do not include segment taxes and airport charges. Coupon books are
valid for a year. They may be ordered on the phone, but must be
picked up in person, with proof of age. Delta: (800) 221-1212.
</P>
<P>
   Membership programs involve discounts, but are full of wrinkles
and caveats. American Express offers two types of cards to
students: credit cards, which have no annual fee but require
interest payments on unpaid balances, or charge cards, which cost
$55 a year, on which the balance must be paid in full each month.
American Express has linked up with Continental Airlines to offer
student cardholders four domestic flights a year at prices starting
at $119 for a weekday round trip to a destination up to 1,000 miles
away and rising to $279 for a weekend trip of 4,000aux:dupe miles
or more. An offer of discounts of $100 to $250 on 10 round-trip
tickets a year to international destinations is also included; the
year begins Sept. 6 and runs until Sept. 5, 2001. These fares
require Saturday-night stays and involve blackout dates, and the
tickets must be charged to the card. American Express: (800)
942-2639; on www.americanexpress.com, go to Visit Our Cards Center,
then American Express Student Cards.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank has linked with American Airlines for its Citibank
Platinum Select Card for College Students, a no-fee credit card. In
the first year of membership, a student gets four certificates to
buy domestic round-trip tickets that range from $139 to $299,
depending on distance, plus one companion certificate. There are
also three certificates for discounts for travel elsewhere, a
discount of $100 to $250 on a ticket to Europe, for example. The
process is slow. It takes three weeks to get a card; information on
getting certificates comes four weeks later, and it take two to
three weeks for certificates to be delivered. Saturday-night stays
may be involved, as well as blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to frequently asked questions on Citibank's Web site
(www.citibank.com) are quite clear, explaining, for example, what
the prime rate is and how it is linked to interest on unpaid
balances. Citibank: (800) 248-4226.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines has a college-student frequent flier program,
United College Plus, that has been sending its members coupons good
for 15 percent off certain tickets. The program is in revision,
according to marketing officials. A Web site for discounted fares
has been folded into the frequent flier site. The program is linked
to a college Visa credit card that earns one mile for every $2
spent. The minimum age is 18; www.collegeplus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Student Advantage, a Boston company, sells a card for $20 a
year, plus $2.50 shipping and handling, that provides a 15 percent
discount on Amtrak and Greyhound walk-up bus fares. College and
high school students, part-time or full-time graduate students and
faculty members are eligible; Mark A. Egan, a spokesman, said that
age was not a qualifier, only enrollment as a student. The card is
sold on campuses, in college bookstores and through a lot of the
merchants it is linked to, including Amtrak and Greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   The Amtrak Student Advantage discount applies to most national
trains. In the Northeast Corridor, it may be used on Acela Regional
trains, but Stephen Taubenkibel, an Amtrak spokesman, said the line
had not decided if it would apply to the Acela Expresses, when they
finally start operating. Some Metroliner trains are also excluded.
There are blackout periods; advance ticketing or reservations may
be required.
</P>
<P>
   At Greyhound, the 15 percent applies to walk-up fares, which are
full fares. Different reductions may be available for buying in
advance or for long circuits on the road, but the 15 percent does
not apply to these. Student Advantage: 280 Summer Street, Boston,
Mass. 02210; (877) 256-4672 or www.studentadvantage.com. Greyhound:
(800) 231-2222; www.greyhound.com. Amtrak: (800) 962-6872;
www.amtrak.com.
</P>
<P>
   For collegians packing all those belongings, Greyhound has a
Student Advantage wrinkle worth a look: 50 percent off package
shipping.

MORE THAN 100 RUSSIAN SAILORS TRAPPED IN SUNKEN NUCLEAR SUBMARINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated.) 
 By SABRINA TAVERNISE with JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ More than 100 Russian sailors were trapped at the
bottom of the Barents Sea Monday with little hope of rescue after
their nuclear submarine was seriously damaged in a collision, the
commander of Russia's navy said.
</P>
<P>
   The navy said it had begun an effort to rescue the crew using a
compression chamber dropped from a ship above. The rescue effort
was expected to last through the night, but Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov, the commander of the Russian navy, said there was little
chance of rescuing the men trapped aboard the submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' Kuroyedov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not offer any details of the collision that crippled the
Kursk, which went into service in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs of a large and serious collision with an
unknown object,'' Kuroyedov said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a U.S. Naval Intelligence official, the Russian
navy has the capability of rescuing crew members from damaged subs.
They have both deep-diving mini-subs and ships carrying compression
chambers that can hook up to the sunken vessel, allowing crew
members to escape through an emergency exit hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The accident apparently occurred during military exercises,
which were under observation by a U.S. electronic surveillance
ship. U.S. officials said the Russian government has not asked for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear submarine weighs more than 17,000 metric tons and
carries a crew of 107 to 130. The sub is believed to be as much as
480 feet below the surface. At that depth the pressure would
complicate any rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 ships, including an aircraft carrier, have been
sent to the scene. But the weather there is poor, further
complicating the rescue efforts, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is serious,'' Kuroyedov said. ``All rescue
forces have been directed there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sub was not carrying any nuclear weapons, the Russian navy
said. But the submarine has two atomic reactors and could cause an
environmental disaster in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials said the crew shut down the reactors
after the accident. The government of Norway, which has a
scientific ship in the area, reported that there has been no sign
of a radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   The accident comes at a critical time for Russia's navy, which
has been under strict budget constraints since the fall of the
Soviet Union. As recently as May, the navy owed officers as much as
six months' back wages.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Russia has slashed its fleet of nuclear-powered
submarines, which now number about 40 in Russia's northern waters,
down from about 120 during the Soviet era, according to Bellona, an
environmental organization based in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money for maintaining the existing number of
submarines, nor is there money to dismantle the old ones,'' said
Alexander Pikayev, program director at the Carnegie Moscow Center.
''The risk of radioactive leakage exists. There are more than 100
potential Chernobyls floating out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1989 a fire broke out on a Soviet submarine, killing 42
of the 69 sailors aboard. That sub sank to the bottom of the
Norwegian Sea. The survivors escaped before the sub hit the ocean
floor.

   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic party's convention, which opens
Monday, presents Vice President Al Gore with perhaps his best and
perhaps last major chance to win some credit for the country's
economic good times while distancing himself from the unsavory
elements of the Clinton administration that he has served for the
last seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The convention marks the final political ceremony before
full-fledged campaigning resumes. It comes two weeks after the
well-oiled Republican political convention in Philadelphia and less
than a week after Gore, who continues to run behind his Republican
opponent, George W. Bush, in the polls announced his choice for his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in a day given over to little substantive business,
the convention will focus its attention on President Bill Clinton
and his wife, Hillary, who is running for the Senate seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York. Both Clintons will
be delivering prime-time speeches. Gore, who is campaigning in the
Midwest, will not address the convention until its conclusion on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, with their campaign theme of looking to the
future, will open their convention by recalling the prosperity and
progress achieved under the Clinton administration. The trick will
be to celebrate Clinton without detracting from Gore's claim of
independence as the new Democratic contender for the White House.
His campaign has been encumbered by a fatigue that many voters say
they feel about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll of the Democratic delegates
coming to the convention to nominate Gore found that while they
viewed themselves as political moderates, their views on issues
from affirmative action to an activist federal government were more
liberal than those of the public or even other Democrats in
general.
</P>
<P>
   And a Gallup poll taken this last weekend and released Monday by
USA Monday and CNN reported that 47 percent of 641 likely voters
sampled said there was ``no chance whatsoever'' that they would
cast their ballots for Gore in November. Only 30 percent said the
same about Bush. Yet 68 percent of the likely voters sampled said
they considered Clinton's presidency successful, despite the
scandal over his relationship with the former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the convention is seeking to highlight Hillary
Clinton's campaign to represent New York in the Senate by
presenting six women who already are senators: Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland, Barbara Boxer and Diane Feinstein of California, Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas and
Patty Murray of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is to deliver her remarks before the president
takes the stage to make his farewell address as the party's leader.
The occasion is traditionally the time for a departing president to
pass the political torch to the candidate nominated to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that the Clintons would steal the
limelight from Gore, making it harder for him to present himself as
a strong, independent leader. But Hillary Clinton promised on
Saturday that she and the president would only remain long enough
to endorse Gore's candidacy and then be ``gone, absolutely,'' from
the convention. The Clintons have irritated some Gore aides by
coming to Los Angeles over the weekend to raise millions of dollars
from Hollywood's entertainment industry for the presidential
library he plans to create in Arkansas and for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's schedule Monday includes at least four speaking
appearances before he addresses the convention. Afterward, the
president is going to Paramount Studios for a Democratic Party
dinner, followed by a convention party on the back lot to which
thousands of guests have been invited,
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign chairman, William Daley, insisted to CBS Monday
that Clinton's high profile _ he is spending more time in Los
Angeles than Gore _ _ is not a problem and that ``the convention is
Al Gore's Tuesday through Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, the convention will also briefly pay tribute
to former President Jimmy Carter, who was defeated after a single
term by Ronald Reagan in 1980. That defeat began 12 years of
Republican leadership in the White House before the Texas
governor's father, George Bush, was ousted by Clinton in 1992.

</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee, 30, the youngest
member of Congress, will deliver the keynote speech, which sets the
tone for the convention. The Democrats will adopt a platform that
competes with the Republicans for voters in the political center.
The platform will call for schools to be made more accountable for
their students' performance, for tighter control of the country's
borders, for expanded world trade, for a stronger military and for
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats' platform will differ from the Republicans' in
its support for abortion rights, for mandatory trigger locks on
guns and for campaign finance reform. Gore has promised to make the
latter the first piece of legislation that he sends to Congress as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will also emphasize the legacy of the late
President John F. Kennedy, with speeches from his daughter,
Caroline Kennedy, and his brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, whom Gore defeated in
the early round of primaries, is also scheduled to speak, as is the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   As the delegates arrived at the Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles, protesters, espousing a variety of causes, from opposition
to the death penalty to vehement complaints about free trade, also
converged at the fences and police barricades erected around the
convention center. Thousands of police officers were on hand,
closing off major thoroughfares and some freeway exits and playing
havoc with the city's already chaotic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The convention offers an opportunity to make Lieberman better
known to the voters. The senator from Connecticut was kept busy
with talk shows and interviews Sunday. In an interview on CNN's
``Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer,'' Lieberman acknowledged that
``there have been some differences of opinion between Al Gore and
me. And I think it is a mark of his strength as a leader that he
didn't look for somebody who agreed with him on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator has differed from Gore in looking favorably on
school vouchers and some private retirement investment accounts in
the Social Security program, among other issues. But Lieberman said
he recognized that ``when the president decides, the vice president
supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the first Jewish candidate of a major party for
vice president. As the first Democratic member of the Senate to
formally criticize Clinton for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, Lieberman is seen as inoculating Gore against Republican
attempts to portray the presidential candidate as tainted by the
controversies surrounding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will address the convention on Wednesday, just before
Gore is formally nominated as the Democratic party's presidential
candidate. The delegations from Tennessee and Connecticut, the
respective states of Gore and Lieberman, have been placed in front
of the stage so their announced votes will be seen as putting Gore
over the top in the required number of votes. The vice president's
elder daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, will speak after the
formal nomination of her father.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has promised that his speech will be long on specifics,
spelling out his plans for trimming taxes for middle-class
families, improving the Social Security system, protecting the
environment and reforming welfare. And while he is likely to make
prominent mention of President Clinton's success in creating a
thriving economy, Gore has stressed that he is running on his own
agenda and with his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to be introduced by his wife, Tipper, who in
turn will be introduced by their younger daughter, Kristin, 23, who
lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual touch, after the speakers leave the podium, they
will each spend 10 minutes or so answering questions about their
remarks from designated Americans. These so-called ``chats'' will
be presented in webcasts between 8 and 11 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are using their convention to attempt to draw a
distinction between Gore and Bush that goes beyond political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Thursday the convention will offer a tribute to
Vietnam veterans, including Gore, who served there for seven months
as an Army journalist. Bush chose to serve as a pilot in the Texas
National Guard and did not go to Vietnam.

MORE THAN 100 RUSSIAN SAILORS TRAPPED IN SUNKEN NUCLEAR SUBMARINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to add additional information on the location in lede

 By SABRINA TAVERNISE with JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ More than 100 Russian sailors were trapped at the
bottom of the Barents Sea above the Arctic Circle Monday with
little hope of rescue after their nuclear submarine was seriously
damaged in a collision, the commander of Russia's navy said.
</P>
<P>
   The navy said it had begun an effort to rescue the crew using a
compression chamber dropped from a ship above. The rescue effort
was expected to last through the night, but Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov, the commander of the Russian navy, said there was little
chance of rescuing the men trapped aboard the submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' Kuroyedov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not offer any details of the collision that crippled the
Kursk, which went into service in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are signs of a large and serious collision with an
unknown object,'' Kuroyedov said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a U.S. Naval Intelligence official, the Russian
navy has the capability of rescuing crew members from damaged subs.
They have both deep-diving mini-subs and ships carrying compression
chambers that can hook up to the sunken vessel, allowing crew
members to escape through an emergency exit hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The accident apparently occurred during military exercises,
which were under observation by a U.S. electronic surveillance
ship. U.S. officials said the Russian government has not asked for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear submarine weighs more than 17,000 metric tons and
carries a crew of 107 to 130. The sub is believed to be as much as
480 feet below the surface. At that depth the pressure would
complicate any rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 ships, including an aircraft carrier, have been
sent to the scene. But the weather there is poor, further
complicating the rescue efforts, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is serious,'' Kuroyedov said. ``All rescue
forces have been directed there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sub was not carrying any nuclear weapons, the Russian navy
said. But the submarine has two atomic reactors and could cause an
environmental disaster in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian navy officials said the crew shut down the reactors
after the accident. The government of Norway, which has a
scientific ship in the area, reported that there has been no sign
of a radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   The accident comes at a critical time for Russia's navy, which
has been under strict budget constraints since the fall of the
Soviet Union. As recently as May, the navy owed officers as much as
six months' back wages.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Russia has slashed its fleet of nuclear-powered
submarines, which now number about 40 in Russia's northern waters,
down from about 120 during the Soviet era, according to Bellona, an
environmental organization based in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money for maintaining the existing number of
submarines, nor is there money to dismantle the old ones,'' said
Alexander Pikayev, program director at the Carnegie Moscow Center.
''The risk of radioactive leakage exists. There are more than 100
potential Chernobyls floating out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1989 a fire broke out on a Soviet submarine, killing 42
of the 69 sailors aboard. That sub sank to the bottom of the
Norwegian Sea. The survivors escaped before the sub hit the ocean
floor.

<P>
   More and more comic-book heroes are springing to life.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping from their pulpy pages right into blockbuster movies,
they're getting a little assist from superstars and super special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Men,'' released by Warner Bros., was the first of a
series of films based on Marvel Comics characters. This one strives
to please all audiences with a combo of respected actors _ Patrick
Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen and Academy Award winner Anna Paquin _
and scantily-clad sex symbols like Halle Berry and Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, together with state-of-the-art effects.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the world of unpredictable box office returns, this
formula would almost guarantee a hit, and Hollywood's major studios
are banking on it. Twelve more superhero-themed films are in
development, including ``The Fantastic Four'' and ``Spider-Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Men'' film heralds the beginning of a new
comic-book-movie era, with 20th Century Fox featuring mutant heroes
of their own. ``The Fantastic Four'' will begin production in
September and aim for release next summer. Co-written by Sam Hamm,
who helped envision the 1989 ``Batman'' film, ``The Fantastic
Four'' promises dazzling high-tech special effects _ a far cry from
Roger Corman's 1992 B-movie version.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over the last year, Columbia Studios has been
developing a Spider-Man project. Teen heartthrobs Leonardo Di
Caprio and Freddie Prinz Jr. had been considered for the role but
those rumors were squelched when Tobey Maguire (``The Cider House
Rules'') signed in July to play the web slinger.
</P>
<P>
   The Hulk will star in his own vehicle due out in the summer of
2002 from Universal Pictures, and even more Marvel heroes are
waiting in the wings, including Captain America, Iron Man, Silver
Surfer, Dr. Strange and Daredevil.
</P>
<P>
   To filmmakers, the X-Men always had an attractive potential as a
franchise. There was a built-in cult appeal as well as the dynamics
for sequels and the ability to merchandise comic books, games and
action figures. By featuring stellar actors and mesmerizing special
effects, the franchise grew to become a prestige project for Warner
Bros. Marvel Comics, on the rebound from filing for Chapter 11 in
1996, warmly embraced the studio's interest in their properties.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel began building their venerable illustrated empire with
``The Fantastic Four'' in 1961 and followed with ``The X-Men'' in
1963. These two titles created a new type of superhero who
struggled with everyday problems in between battles with
megalomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Fantastic Four'' immediately found a cult of devoted
fans, ``The X-Men'' auditioned a varying cast of characters before
hitting pay dirt in 1991. In a bold marketing move, Marvel packaged
``X-Men 1'' with five different covers. It sold over 8 million
issues to become the industry's best selling comic. A feature film
might have been the logical next step had special effects
technology been able to simulate the characters' signature powers.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing comic book characters to the big screen isn't a new
idea. Hollywood produced their first superhero films less then a
decade after the Golden Age of comics in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after his introduction in ``Action Comics 1'' (June
1938), Superman made his film debut in a series of low budget
movies made by Republic Pictures. Kirk Alyn starred in six pictures
including ``Atom Man vs. Superman'' (1950) before George Reeves
took over the role in 1951. Lacking the technology and the budget
for special effects, Reeves still made a convincing hero, even
though in ``Superman vs. The Mole Men'' (1951), he never even
demonstrated his ability to fly!
</P>
<P>
   Batman, who originally appeared in ``Detective Comics 27'' in
May 1939, burst upon the screen in a campy 1966 film. In addition
to creating a world of surreal gadgets and trendy fashions, this
Batman series also featured journeyman actors such as Cesar Romero
as The Joker and Burgess Meredith as The Penguin. Like ``Superman''
a decade earlier, ``Batman'' successfully spun off to a television
series.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s, comic book characters could only thrive on
the small screen. First appearing in Allstar Comics in 1941, Wonder
Woman, played by Lynda Carter, starred in her own TV series in
1976. Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno personified the before-and-after
versions of The Incredible Hulk in a 1977 series. Made-for-TV
movies brought the occult hero Dr. Strange and the patriotic
Captain America from the page to the screen in 1978 and 1979. These
moderately successful exploits led the way for another screen
version of ``Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Christopher Reeves brought the Man of Steel back to the
movie screen with effects far superior to his television
counterpart. Three ``Superman'' sequels were spun off by 1987. Two
years later in 1989, Batman made his move back to the big screen,
shedding the flippant attitude of the TV series for a Gothic edge.
</P>
<P>
   These films helped elevate comic-book-movies from pulpy serials
to more serious cinema with the budget to attract Hollywood's
hottest talent, like Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and Jack
Nicholson. As in the case of ``Superman,'' ``Batman'' lasted three
sequels, ending in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Superman, Batman and the company of costumed heroes
presented definitive good guys in past decades, the new wave of
comic book movies presents more tormented figures. Rather than
clean-cut champions, these characters struggle with personal
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Men'' centers on two troubled youths: Rogue, whose touch
will kill any soul, and Wolverine, a man whose tortured past is a
mystery even to him. The Fantastic Four reckon with internal
conflict as well as ruthless villains. Spider-Man, one of Marvel's
most popular heroes, is essentially a geeky teen. He's a figure
everyone can relate to as he battles girl troubles and a crabby
boss along with desperados.
</P>
<P>
   Each generation sees their heroes in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   Superman and Batman grew out of the depression era and Cold War.
They represented the ultimate Nelson Algren story, ``Young Man
Makes Good by Saving the World,'' on the one hand _ and a vision of
the urban underworld on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The recent crop of Gen X superheroes illustrates more complex
protagonists as they struggle with their own psychological demons.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Lane and The Joker were a piece of cake compared to the
troubled teen angst of today. Will Spider-Man get a date? Tune in
next summer.

   ``My brothers and my best friends were all there through high
school when I promised I'd never be a cheerleader. So they're all
ready to tear me apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences will likely be shocked, too, particularly those
familiar with Dushku's career. The 19-year-old Boston-born actress
usually plays serious, smart and dark characters, and she's best
known for her portrayal of Faith, the bad girl, on ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of me in characters as the bad girl, but it
goes much deeper than that,'' Dushku says by telephone from the Los
Angeles home she shares with her brother, Nate. ``That's why I
choose to play them, because I try to give these characters more
depth and facets than people tend to give them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think they're more interesting to play. I can't say
they're challenging, because they come easily to me. I don't mean
to say it's easy for me to be bad, but it's something that's in
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that in real life, you can't act out the way evil
characters act out,'' she explains. ``And, by playing them
realistically so that you get different reactions _ compassion,
sympathy _ that's the real challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy, in ``Bring It On,'' is far from evil, but she's got an
attitude, something the cliquey cheerleaders, the Toros, at her new
high school, notice instantly when she turns up for a tryout.
However, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the squad's captain, recognizes
Missy's talent and wants her on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble starts, though, when Torrance realizes the
Toros' routines were pilfered from a team at an inner city school
that's about to compete against them for a national cheerleading
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a lot of fun,'' Dushku says. ``I went in to
read and I loved the director (Peyton Reed), who's hysterical. At
the beginning, Missy is the anti-cheerleader, and I felt like that
when I first went in to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got there and all these girls were in the waiting room.
There were also girls in the courtyard doing flips and stunting. I
was giving everybody dirty looks and then went in for my meeting.
That attitude was apparently just what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I signed the contract and went in for the first day, I
realized what I had missed. I was doing a lot of films when I was
growing up, so I couldn't be part of a cheerleading team or have
the kind of female bonding that girls on teams experience. I never
realized cheerleading was so physical or so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' she adds, ``to discover something totally
new.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene that will likely push Dushku's brothers and pals over
the edge is the one in which Missy first appears in her
cheerleading uniform. As her friends look on from their car, Missy
stands in a doorway posing and laughing. Dushku's face and body
language convey equal parts embarrassment, flirtatiousness and
``this isn't so bad!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the first scenes we shot,'' the actress says.
``I was in wardrobe and it was the first time I put on the uniform.
They did my makeup and said, `Let's put ribbons in your hair.' I
said, `Ribbons! I've never had ribbons in my hair in my entire
life!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside, they had the car with Kirsten and the other kids. I
came through the back of the house, and when they said `Action,' I
walked out there with the camera rolling. I was completely
mortified, completely humiliated, but kind of excited, too, because
no one had ever seen me like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I goofed off and did my little dance. It was fun, and
pieces of that first take are in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku hopes moviegoers appreciate the scene and that they like
``Bring It On'' as a whole. It's not, she readily admits, going to
win any Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comedy and it's supposed to be fun,'' she says. `You
could say it's about taking cheerleaders more seriously, but the
film doesn't try to shove that down anyone's throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going in that it wasn't `American Beauty,' but it's
what it is. It's light. It's a feel-good movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku's next film, ``Soul Survivors,'' is a return to the dark
side. She plays party girl Annabel, one of several college freshman
who may or may not be dead following a horrific car crash. The
red-hot cast of the thriller, which will be released next year,
includes Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck and Melissa Sagemiller
</P>
<P>
   Dushku herself has been red-hot before. She made her film debut
in ``That Night'' (1992), then acted opposite Robert De Niro in
``This Boy's Life'' (1992) before hitting the big time with ``True
Lies'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''`True Lies' was a blockbuster, a huge jump from my first two
films, which didn't get any recognition at all,'' Dushku says. ``It
was also a $120 million movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was
the most fun a 12-year-old could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me cell phones and pagers, and Arnold took my
friends and me to Planet Hollywood in his Hummer. And then, when
the film came out, everyone I knew saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised Mormon and practically every Mormon in Boston
went and saw an R-rated movie, which just doesn't happen. So it was
huge and for a while `True Lies Girl' was a fun title to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku worked intermittently after ``True Lies,'' forsaking
Hollywood and acting in Boston and high school. When she decided to
pursue acting full-time, she relocated to Los Angeles, went on the
audition trail and landed her role as Faith, butt-kicker
extraordinaire on ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith was meant to appear in just a handful of episodes in
1998-1999, during the show's third season. The character proved so
popular, however, that the show's producers invited Dushku to stick
around. And, much to the satisfaction of Buffyphiles everywhere,
Dushku guest-starred not only in several well-received fourth
season episodes of ``Buffy,'' but also two episodes of the
``Buffy'' spinoff, ``Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience really reacted to her,'' Dushku says. ``Buffy
(Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the blonde heroine who's always doing
the right thing and Faith was just a beautiful thing to throw in
there, not necessarily to stir things up, but just for the
contrast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans, who take the show really seriously, were so open to
having something new, and that was great. I was surprised and I was
delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku is open to reprising Faith on ``Buffy'' and ``Angel,''
and she'd also be willing to reclaim her ``True Lies Girl'' title
if James Cameron and Schwarzenegger go forward with a ``True Lies''
sequel. Like any 19-year-old, though, Dushku prefers not to think
too long or hard about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals and my everything change daily,'' she says, laughing.
``It's insane. It freaks me out. My life feels like it's in speed
mode right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a class at UCLA, just learned how to rock climb and
I have the two movies coming out. So I've got all these things
going crazy inside me.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days, it's going to hit me what I want to do for
the long haul, but it's so unclear to me at this point. Talk to me
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting and it's scary. But I love it.''

 By KEVIN DICKSON 
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada 
 Not to be published in Canada before Sept. 10. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Unlike Survivor Island, the world of ``Bette'' is actually
inhabited, albeit in a much less exaggerated form, by Midler
herself.
 &HT;    The TV Bette is a brassy stage and screen star with a husband
and a teen-age daughter and, coincidentally, has starred in the
same movies as Midler herself.
 &HT;    And, after watching mere mortals battle against the maelstrom of
the Divine Miss M's TV-alter ego, it's tempting to ask her if
anyone in her life has ever asked to be voted off?
 &HT;    Of course, given Midler's notoriously caustic tongue, it's much
safer to ask just how much the TV diva resembles the real one.
 &HT;    ``Not really,'' Midler answers thoughtfully. ``I love a good
laugh but I'm also a quiet soul and not very social. I work hard
and I try to give back to my community.''
 &HT;    She also admits: ``My behind-the-scenes life is actually quite a
serious one and I wish it were a little sillier. I've been working
for years to lighten up, but it's very hard, especially after you
reach a certain age.''
 &HT;    In light of Midler's lengthy career as a bawdy comic, it's
almost impossible to listen to her speak so earnestly without
expecting her almond eyes to narrow mischievously, the way they do
before she delivers a hilarious punch line. But it appears this
show is going to make fun of our perceptions of a star, not
necessarily give us insight into the private life of one.
 &HT;    Still, in this current sudden-death TV climate, where shows are
cancelled after only two or three weeks on air, the smartest thing
that Midler can do is capitalize on her larger-than-life image.
This way, viewers can skip the acclimatization to a new character,
a hurdle that Geena Davis faces in her own new series, which
ignores her celebrity baggage entirely and puts her into a
quasi-``Sex and The City'' scenario, with not a single Cutthroat
Island joke in sight. Midler knows this is true.
 &HT;    ``We read a lot of pilots,'' Midler explains, ``but this one was
the truest. The others were very typical sitcom situations.''
Midler goes on to explain that this was the only format that she
felt ``captured her voice.''
 &HT;    And what a voice it is. Indeed, the most magical moment in the
first episode of the new CBS show is the one in which her
character, undergoing an age crisis, decides to spice up her act by
incorporating contemporary songs.
 &HT;    She starts by attempting thug-rock-rapper Kid Rock's
unfathomable ``Bawitdaba,'' and ends up turning it into a trademark
Midler boogie-woogie. If the series' writers are able to come up
with other scripted opportunities to showcase Midler's voice,
``Bette'' could be this year's big hit.
 &HT;    One observation Midler is prepared for is that she had to turn
to TV because the film offers have dried up. ``I've had a good run
in films,'' she points out, adding that many of her female
contemporaries ``don't have the kind of jobs they once had.''
 &HT;    Midler has also grown tired of the film development process, or
as she puts it, ``the sturm und drang, the angst of pulling these
movies out of your ... your kishkas,'' she laughs. ``Then you have
to wait for the 25-year-old to give you the green light. I mean,
forget it,'' she laughs again. ``Life is too short.''
 &HT;    Although the native New Yorker will be flying to Los Angeles to
film the first season, she's been promised that if the ratings are
good, the show will move to her home town, ``the center of the
universe,'' in its second season.
 &HT;    Midler plans to be a hands-on star, guiding the show as much as
she can. ``The one thing I would like to avoid is anything
saccharine or overly sentimental. I'd like it to be drier. And I
like the idea of physical comedy because that's something I do. I
also like the idea of using music because that's something I can
bring that most people can't.''
 &HT;    So, with production about to start in Los Angeles, it looks like
there's only one storm cloud on the ebullient star's horizon: She's
been scheduled against ratings powerhouse ``Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?'' in the United States. ``I'm really hoping for the
best and I'm really going to do my best,'' she says. ``I'm going to
promote, promote, promote, flog, flog, flog.''
 &HT;    She laughs loudly and then her eyes take on that trademark
naughty sparkle.
 &HT;    ``You know what?'' she teases, ``How long can Regis go on? Maybe
he'll be struck by lightning!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you heard the rumor about how Jennifer Lopez insured her
body for a billion dollars?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best rumor I ever read about myself! It's actually
been on the front page of newspapers!'' Lopez says with whooping
laughter. ``It's not true. I haven't even insured it for $50.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 30, wants to set the record straight on a number of
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   No, she doesn't demand $2,000-a-night hotel rooms. Nor does she
expect instant, perfectly chilled champagne 24 hours a day. And no,
her boyfriend Sean ``Puffy'' Combs didn't forbid her from smooching
it up with Matthew McConaughey in their Valentine's Day 2001 flick,
``The Wedding Planner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All untrue,'' Lopez says with a sigh. ``Puff did come to the
set. He was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``It is uncomfortable for both Puffy and me to watch
each other do love scenes. It's just weird. When he kisses some
girl in his videos, I'm like, `Ewwwwwww.' But as far as being
upset, no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read another good one,'' she offers. ``that Puff bought
me a house for $4 million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is like a circus act and all I can do is keep
juggling,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is not a diva _ and she can provide references.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you the numbers of everyone I've ever worked with
who will tell you I'm not a pain,'' Lopez says. ``People have a
totally happy experience with me. I get along with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent D'Onofrio, who stars with her in ``The Cell'' (opening
August 18), confirms this: ``Jennifer is hands down an actress. She
never held anyone up on this movie. She never acted out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the flesh, Lopez is quieter and smaller than you would
expect, with big brown saucer eyes, and she asserts she doesn't
usually rely on anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm East Coast. I think there's a different mentality,'' she
says. ``I operate from the base of `You've got to take care of
yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cell,'' she plays a child-therapist who helps invent a
mental transferral system where you can go into the minds of coma
patients. She must enter the brain matter of a psycho serial
killer, played by D'Onofrio, to save his last victim.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by new talent Tarsem, is clearly one of the
most edgy and disturbing movies of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read it, I thought it had that `Silence of the Lambs'
feel to it and you could go places in the dream sequences,'' Lopez
says. ``I loved the freaky visuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez actually went to a therapist to research the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really interesting. I started telling this therapist
about a problem I had pretty much figured out. And she was like,
`No you haven't figured it out.' It was actually very helpful to go
into one's own head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez always imagined a different life.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up poor as a Puerto Rican living in the Bronx. Her
escape was going to the movies. Lopez grew up idolizing Barbra
Streisand, Bette Midler and anyone else who could carry a show
tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to grow up to be Anita from `West Side Story,''' she
says. ``She wasn't a wimp like that helpless Maria.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 after graduating from high school, the non-wimpy Lopez
got a job with a European theater group that sang Broadway hits. By
1990, she came back to the States where she was hired as one of the
Fly Girls on TV's ``In Living Color.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``My Family,'' (1995) ``Money Train,'' (1995)
``Jack,'' (1996) ``Selena,'' (1997) ``Anaconda,'' (1997) ``Blood
and Wine,'' (1997) ``U Turn'' (1997) and ``Out of Sight'' (1998)
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, ``The Wedding Planner,'' a romantic comedy with
McConaughey, is in the can. She has also wrapped the drama ``Angel
Eyes'' set for 2001 release.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a second Jennifer Lopez album is due out this
October. She's not worried if it doesn't go double platinum like
``On the Six,'' her mega-successful debut CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to touch people with this new music. It's not
about selling more records. It's about having something to really
say through the music. And this is a personal album,'' she
divulges. ``There are many songs about love. I think of it as the
soundtrack to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about her life outside her career, like marriage, and
she shrugs evasively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's a private thing. Puffy and I have a
relationship right now and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez divorced her first husband, model and waiter Ojani Noa, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   She says the media attention hurt their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to really become famous when I had first gotten
married. I had this responsibility and then I lost my anonymity.
And the press was making up stories about me and my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't deal with it. He was just a regular guy. I saw
that it was hurting him and bothering him, which broke my heart.
All these totally fabricated stories about how we were not getting
along came out barely a month after we were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to explain it to him, and even I couldn't understand
it. I wanted to sue or boycott the media,'' she says. ``It was
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too crazy. Shortly after she split with her husband, Lopez
started dating Puffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier for me to be involved with a public
figure. Puffy understands everything. He helps me cope. He is as
busy as I am. But then we can come together.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not your average couple.
</P>
<P>
   Take their biggest fight. He gets mad that she won't use his
bodyguards to go to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `I don't care! I'm going out! If people recognize me,
it's OK,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to walk around with a bodyguard,'' she insists.
``I like to be a normal person and do my thing.''

   LIVING LA VIDA LOPEZ IS NEVER EASY
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER-LOPEZ-STARBEAT _ Jennifer Lopez, who just turned 30,
says her life is like a circus act. No wonder. She has recently
wrapped three movies, one ``The Cell'' opening Aug. 18, and a new,

a child therapist who helps invent a way to go into the minds of

   BETTE-MIDLER-STARBEAT _ The new CBS fall show ``Bette,''
starring, of course, Bette Midler, is geared more to making fun of
everyone's perceptions of a star, rather than offering insight into
the private life of one. But it capitalizes on her larger-than-life
image. Contrary to popular assumption, Midler's behind-the-scenes
life is actually quite a serious one. ``I wish it were a little
sillier,'' she admits. ``I've been working for years to lighten
up!'' By Kevin Dickson of TV Guide Canada. WITH PHOTO.

   ELIZA-DUSHKU-STARBEAT _ Eliza Dushku, 19, who portrays bad girl
Faith in TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' never imagined she'd
one day play a cheerleader. Never! ``In high school I promised I'd
never be a cheerleader,'' she asserts. But once she started work in
``Bring It On,'' she realized what she had missed. ``I never had
the kind of female bonding that girls on teams experience, nor did
I realize cheerleading was so physical or so dangerous,'' she
confesses. ``It was awesome to discover something so totally new.''

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 12, 1997, Arthur Bailey, one of the dozens of lawyers
who helped negotiate a $1.25 billion settlement finalized last
month between Swiss banks and Holocaust survivors, bought a copy of
the book ``Nazi Gold'' by Tom Bower and spent 8.6 hours reviewing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Cost to plaintiffs: $2,365, or $275 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The item is one of hundreds included in a $13.5 million request
for legal fees now before the federal judge overseeing the
settlement. That price tag does not include $3 million that
attorneys who volunteered their services have asked to be funneled
to specific charities, or the $12 million spent to locate
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Some Holocaust survivors and Jewish leaders say they are
outraged at such requests. They argue that chasing clients and fees
in the wake of one of mankind's worst atrocities degrades the
memories of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning that the lawyers should be acting
pro bono,'' without compensation, said Elan Steinberg, executive
director of the World Jewish Congress. ``No one should profit from
the Holocaust. But even more troubling to us than the application
for fees are some of the outrageous charges they have made.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bailey's time spent reading books, other lawyers'
requests include compensation for a 30-minute interview with the
Washington Post, a nearly $90,000 bill for photocopying, and
billings for lengthy telephone consultations between lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the attorneys who are working pro bono are upset, also,
that colleagues would accept money for pursuing what may be the
most clear-cut human rights case in the history of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they get up in the morning and think about the case
in the shower and someone should pay them for it,'' said Burt
Neuborne, a New York University law professor who headed the
settlement team assembled at the behest of the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the same lawyers who have expressed indignation in
the case, including Neuborne, will share $50 million being set
aside for fees in a separate case, the $4.8 billion settlement with
the German government over its use of slave labor during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maze began with the start of negotiations between
world Jewish organizations and the Swiss banks in 1995 over
reparations for survivors. Jewish leaders were livid about decades
of stonewalling by Swiss bankers, who sometimes demanded to see
death certificates for those lost in the concentration camps before
they would consider heirs' claims to family fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   As these negotiations grew heated, the Clinton administration
declassified and released reams of documents that helped detail the
looting of Jewish assets during the war and the Swiss purchase of
Nazi gold -- some of it obtained by melting down the dental
fillings of Jewish victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ensuing recriminations touched off a flurry of lawsuits on
behalf of survivors by at least 27 American lawyers. Those lawsuits
begat other lawsuits: against top German companies that had
employed slave labor during World War II, insurance companies that
refused to pay off policies on Holocaust victims, various European
governments and other alleged profiteers.
</P>
<P>
   Under mounting pressure, the Swiss proposed the settlement in
1998, helping spur other settlements. It was made final last month,
although the legal fees and a disbursement plan are still
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same lawyers and plaintiffs are involved in multiple
cases, some still pending, so it is difficult to determine
precisely who will benefit in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers involved in these ongoing talks defended the
legal fees being discussed as reasonable and well-deserved, given
the fact that people seeking justice unsuccessfully for more than
five decades are finally poised to realize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will get justice in the future if we expect everyone to
work for nothing?'' asked Edward Fagan of Livingston, N.J., whose
$4 million request for fees is the largest in the Swiss bank case.
``No one is asking to take advantage, just to be paid for the
reasonable value of our services, plus something for the risk. We
all took an enormous risk. These weren't slam-dunk cases.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 17, at a ceremony in Germany announcing the slave-labor
settlement, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, a key
negotiator in the case, credited lawyers with winning justice for
hundreds of thousands of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors, relieved that someone is finally being made to
pay for the theft of Jewish fortunes, express heartfelt gratitude
that lawyers not only listened but were able to squeeze concessions
from the bankers and governments of Europe. But others term the
settlement funds ``blood money'' and argue it shouldn't be shared
by anyone other than survivors.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the money obtained for this fund should go directly to
the VICTIMS and their HEIRS,'' began a letter from one survivor to
the judge in the Swiss banks case, before it provided horrific
details of the writer being chased from her home to the camps,
where she lost countless relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor of the Warsaw ghetto asked that all the money
go to survivors with only ``reasonable fees'' for lawyers and
nothing for institutions ``unless survivors themselves designate
them as caretakers.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 Holocaust survivors have refused to participate in
the settlement, according to a story by the British news service
Reuters. ``We have been betrayed here,'' Paul Frenkel told Reuters.
``What is this? Everybody is picking at this corpse of the
survivors. They're all at it -- the attorneys, the organizations,
the lead counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the case said they don't expect U.S.
District Judge Edward R. Korman to be generous when it comes to
legal fees. The judge is expected to hold a hearing in Brooklyn
sometime this fall to address fees. He also has to rule on a plan
being devised by a court-appointed ``special master'' for
disbursing the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objections regarding attorneys' fees are premature,'' the
judge said in a curt, one-paragraph reference in his 55-page
decision. ``Although fee applications have been filed (and do not
appear to exceed 1 percent of the total recovery if the
applications are granted in their entirety), I have not yet made
any decision regarding those applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other class-action suits, the Swiss banks' case and its
accompanying Holocaust-era cases have presented logistical
nightmares. Korman, faced with sorting out countless competing
actions, asked Neuborne to put together a settlement team that
included 10 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Even some who are highly critical of Fagan -- whose frequent
news conferences and combative personality alienated most of his
fellow lawyers -- concede that his high-profile behavior might have
served to put pressure on the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees, however, that it was brilliant legal
strategizing that led to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg credits sanctions threatened by then-Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato (R-N.Y.), and New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi with
forcing the issue. The banks settled days before the sanctions were
to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   NYU's Neuborne has asked that a standard typically applied in
human rights cases be used in deciding fee requests in this case.
It calls for a strict accounting of billing that credits only time
spent advancing the cause of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some items on the fee request are likely to draw scrutiny if
that standard is applied.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, whose supporting fee documents have not yet been
released, told the judge he often had to work ''12 or 14 hours a
day, seven days per week, for months on end.'' In a separate court
filing, Melvyn Weiss, a longtime Fagan critic who is considered one
of the key settlement attorneys, asked that $1 million be set aside
for ``public-interest-oriented legal education'' as well as
$246,558.89 for his expenses. Morris Ratner, another lawyer, sought
$1.5 million to endow a chair at Columbia University Law School's
Human Rights Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much money goes for legal fees, the problem of
disbursing the remainder is no easy matter. The number of heirs
expected to make a case for money deposited in Swiss banks is
expected to number in the tens of thousands. But there are half a
million more prospective plaintiffs, from slave laborers to people
rejected entry into Switzerland during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The legal team already spent $12 million -- more money that
comes out of the settlement and already approved by the judge -- to
advertise the settlement worldwide and process roughly 600,000
questionnaires from potential plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's special master, Judah Gribetz, has until Sept. 1 to
finish work on his distribution proposal, and the judge has
stressed that he wants to begin distributing money to aging
survivors as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gribetz has no say (and had no comment) on the legal fees. But
others said the fall hearing before the judge should be
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be significant opposition to the requests
by some,'' said Michael Hausfeld, a Washington lawyer who worked on
the case pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Ratner, whose firm is making a donation to Columbia in lieu of
its fee, said he anticipates a lot of lawyer-bashing at the
hearing, ``especially in a case where every dollar is a dollar the
Swiss banks owed the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in fact, the fee request is modest,'' he added, ``and, in
all likelihood, it will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
who once belittled Fagan in print, said he is happy the case is
coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go back to the real issue of how we continue to teach
the moral lessons of the Holocaust,'' he said. ``I'm not sure that
writing the check is doing it.''

<P>
   Not everyone agrees, however, that it was brilliant legal
strategizing that led to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg credits sanctions threatened by then-Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato (R-N.Y.), and New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi with
forcing the issue. The banks settled days before the sanctions were
to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   NYU's Neuborne has asked that a standard typically applied in
human rights cases be used in deciding fee requests in this case.
It calls for a strict accounting of billing that credits only time
spent advancing the cause of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some items on the fee request are likely to draw scrutiny if
that standard is applied.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, whose supporting fee documents have not yet been
released, told the judge he often had to work ''12 or 14 hours a
day, seven days per week, for months on end.'' In a separate court
filing, Melvyn Weiss, a longtime Fagan critic who is considered one
of the key settlement attorneys, asked that $1 million be set aside
for ``public-interest-oriented legal education'' as well as
$246,558.89 for his expenses. Morris Ratner, another lawyer, sought
$1.5 million to endow a chair at Columbia University Law School's
Human Rights Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much money goes for legal fees, the problem of
disbursing the remainder is no easy matter. The number of heirs
expected to make a case for money deposited in Swiss banks is
expected to number in the tens of thousands. But there are half a
million more prospective plaintiffs, from slave laborers to people
rejected entry into Switzerland during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The legal team already spent $12 million -- more money that
comes out of the settlement and already approved by the judge -- to
advertise the settlement worldwide and process roughly 600,000
questionnaires from potential plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's special master, Judah Gribetz, has until Sept. 1 to
finish work on his distribution proposal, and the judge has
stressed that he wants to begin distributing money to aging
survivors as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gribetz has no say (and had no comment) on the legal fees. But
others said the fall hearing before the judge should be
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be significant opposition to the requests
by some,'' said Michael Hausfeld, a Washington lawyer who worked on
the case pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Ratner, whose firm is making a donation to Columbia in lieu of
its fee, said he anticipates a lot of lawyer-bashing at the
hearing, ``especially in a case where every dollar is a dollar the
Swiss banks owed the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in fact, the fee request is modest,'' he added, ``and, in
all likelihood, it will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
who once belittled Fagan in print, said he is happy the case is
coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go back to the real issue of how we continue to teach
the moral lessons of the Holocaust,'' he said. ``I'm not sure that
writing the check is doing it.''

   SCI-TURKEY-ARCHEO (Sardis, Turkey) _ In the ruins of Sardis,
capital of the Lydians of yore, archaeologists are striving to
separate fact from legend, seeking glimpses of what it meant in
antiquity to be ``rich as Croesus.'' But they are also finding much
more: monumental remains of the passage of time and fortune for a
major city under subsequent Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine
rule. Here, on the slopes of a broad river valley about 50 miles
inland from the Aegean Sea, in what is now western Turkey but was
then known as Asia Minor, King Croesus reigned in the sixth century

 &HT;    Journey to Mars, right from your reading chair
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Mars looks like New Mexico, except with
rocks instead of cactus.
</P>
<P>
   I know that because of the National Geographic's new trade
paperback of ``Mars: Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet.''
It's a collection of NASA photographs of images deriving from the
Pathfinder Mission, but what makes the book a keeper are the images
that have been processed for 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes several pair of 3-D glasses, so now you can
get the same effect as if you had actually traveled to Mars ... or
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Before Uncle Vanya ...
</P>
<P>
   Somehow or another, I missed the hardcover edition of ``The
Undiscovered Chekhov `` when it came out last year, but I have no
intention of slighting the paperback (7 Stories is the publisher).
The volume translates 43 (!) stories, 41 of which had never been
published in English. All of the work derives from the early years
of Chekhov's writing career, before age and illness settled him
into the ruefully gentle pessimism that we know so well from his
plays and later stories.
</P>
<P>
   This Chekhov is brighter, more experimental and certainly more
energetic _ one might even say zippier, although his use of
language, or what seems to be his use of language in Peter
Constantine's translations _ still seems the quietly perfect work
of a young master.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of Chekhov, or of Russian literature, will certainly want
to have this volume.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com, among the best of the Web's literary/cultural sites,
is publishing yet another anthology of its best work. ``Salon
Wanderlust: Real Life Tales of Adventure and Romance,'' will
showcase writers like Isabel Allende, Po Bronson and Jan Morris.
Villard will publish.
</P>
<P>
   Heading in the other direction, James Ellroy will publish a
collection of pieces that originally appeared in GQ on
Contentville.com. The deal was for online rights only, with Ellroy
reserving rights to a print collection.
</P>
<P>
   Contentville.com agreed to pay Ellroy an advance as well as a
royalty.

   The brain is the mastermind of flavor, but tongues are where it
starts _ and some are far more sensitive than others. For example,
``super-tasters'' have the most taste buds. Because taste buds are
surrounded by nerve endings that sense not only taste but pain and
touch, super-tasters, perhaps not surprisingly, have a more
sensational taste repertoire. Bitter tastes bitterer, some sweets
taste sweeter. In this feature, Patricia Gadsby recounts how day in
a ``taste lab,'' where she learned about super-tasters _ and the
fact that we don't all live in the same taste world. Two color and
three B&AMP;W slides are available. (slugged:

 (One color slide is included.) 
 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Ever since Julius Caesar decreed that the empire of Rome should
follow a solar calendar rather than ancient lunar calendars,
mankind has been ever so slightly out of sync with the moon.
 &HT;    August 2000 marks one of those rare occasions when the calendar
happens to neatly coincide with a full 29.5-day lunar cycle,
beginning with a hair-thin crescent that will wax into a brilliant
full moon at midmonth and fully wane on the 29th.
 &HT;    Sculptured around the phases of the moon, this month is a good
time to pay homage to our nearest heavenly neighbor.
 &HT;    The moon tends to loom very large in the mind's eye, but in fact
it would take 105,050 objects of the same size to completely fill
the sky.
 &HT;    Its brightness is something of an illusion as well. Because we
never step directly from sunlight to moonlight, gauging the
difference in intensity is difficult.
 &HT;    Surprisingly, the sun is 450,000 times brighter than the full
moon. Our satellite's surface is as dark as asphalt. Still, the
moon, as it nears its full phase this month, will be dazzling
enough to wash out the famous Perseid meteors, beloved by summer
campers and country vacationers.
 &HT;    Those sky watchers who linger by their campfires will see the
same lunar hemisphere that humans have gazed upon since time
immemorial.
 &HT;    The moon shows us only one face because it rotates on its axis
in the same period that it orbits Earth. The speed of the slow
axial spin is just 10 mph at the equator. A jogger perpetually
circumnavigating the moon in the right direction would never see
the sun rise or set.
 &HT;    If the moon behaved like every other major satellite in the
solar system and orbited over the equator of its mother planet, it
would traverse Orion's Belt each month.
 &HT;    Instead, it ignores Earth's tilt and revolves around the globe
in the same plane as the planets, taking it through the zodiac
constellations and delivering vivid planetary conjunctions, like
its striking predawn meeting with Jupiter and Saturn on Aug. 23.
 &HT;    Even the slant of the moon is unusual. It stands straight up
relative to the sun; this lack of tilt allows depressions at the
poles to remain permanently shadowed. Those dark regions are cold
enough that they might conceal billions of tons of ice locked away
in deep freeze, a convenient water source that may drastically
change the course of future space exploration.
 &HT;    The moon's battered surface is covered with a soil of
talcum-powder softness. The silicon-oxygen mix of the rocks below
closely matches the composition of Earth's crust and mantle _ so
closely that scientists now believe the moon must have once been a
piece of our own planet, blown into space by a spectacular
collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body.

 By KATHY A. SVITIL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Bill Stone will never forget the day he began to make diving
history by immersing himself in Wakulla Springs, a network of
submerged caves in northern Florida.
 &HT;    On the early afternoon of Dec. 3, 1987, he swam to a depth of
about 30 feet and settled in, carrying only two 30-cubic-foot
oxygen tanks and a sack of ``blood and gore'' war novels.
 &HT;    Had he been using normal scuba gear, he would have had to
surface after 30 minutes. But Stone, an automation engineer at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington, D.C.,
was wearing a homemade rebreather.
 &HT;    He didn't come up for 24 hours _ the longest anyone has ever
survived underwater with a self-contained breathing device.
 &HT;    ``When I got out of the water and checked, I found I'd used only
half of my consumables. That was the big shock. I could have stayed
under for another 24 hours,'' he says.
 &HT;    Stone's rebreather recycles his exhaled air, scrubbing it of
poisonous carbon dioxide and squeezing out every last molecule of
oxygen in his tanks. His inventiveness has transformed the ability
of humans to carry out scientific exploration underwater. With
rebreathers, divers can linger for half a day without thinking
about their air supply.
 &HT;    The concept of rebreathers is not new. In the 1870s, Henry
Fleuss, a British merchant seaman, developed the first primitive
oxygen rebreather _ an unwieldy device handy for rescuing mine
workers, For the next hundred years or so research into rebreathers
was carried on primarily by navy engineers.
 &HT;    Convinced that rebreathers could be small, cheap and reliable,
Stone designed his first rig in the mid-1980s and dubbed it the
MK1. He eventually founded a company, Cis-Lunar Development
Laboratories in South Lancaster, Mass., which has developed four
more models.
 &HT;    The latest one, the MK-5P, features sophisticated gas and depth
sensors, three microprocessors, computer displays and a $17,500
price tag.
 &HT;    Dozens of other companies have hopped on the bandwagon. With a
rebreather, as with scuba gear, a diver inhales through a
mouthpiece, drawing compressed gas from a tank. But the expired air
is saved, shuttled through a valve into a balloonlike bag, and then
back into the breathing loop.
 &HT;    With each breath the concentration of oxygen in the bag drops
and carbon dioxide rises. The main job of the rebreather is to get
rid of carbon dioxide while replenishing the oxygen in the diver's
air supply.
 &HT;    Canisters of soda lime or lithium hydroxide do the first part by
scrubbing carbon dioxide out of the air. In the fanciest rigs, such
as the MK-5P, electronic controls take care of the second part,
automatically sensing the oxygen content and injecting more of the
gas as needed.
 &HT;    The process is not nearly as foolproof as it might sound.
``Sooner or later, your scrubber canister is going to run out and
you are going to start inspiring a high, potentially dangerous
level of carbon dioxide,'' says John Clarke, scientific director of
the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City, Fla.
 &HT;    If carbon-dioxide concentrations reach about 10 percent, inhaled
air becomes lethal, no matter how much oxygen is present.
 &HT;    ``Right now, we have no way of letting the diver know if that is
happening. With a rebreather, you can die without even knowing that
you are dying,'' Clarke says.
 &HT;    Divers must rely on carefully calculated tables that let them
know how long their scrubbers should last if everything is
functioning perfectly.
 &HT;    One solution being studied is a sensor that measures
carbon-dioxide levels by detecting the distinctive frequencies of
infrared radiation emitted by the carbon-dioxide molecule as it
vibrates in the air.
 &HT;    Engineers also are developing films that monitor changes of pH,
or acidity, in exhaled air. Dissolved carbon dioxide makes air more
acidic, so a sudden drop in pH means carbon-dioxide levels are
spiking.
 &HT;    ``The films could be placed directly on the body, to measure
carbon-dioxide intake,'' says Martin Heerschap, project manager for
Cochran Undersea Technology in Richardson, Texas, which
manufactures an electronic, fully closed rebreather.
 &HT;    Other advances may allow the machinery to respond still more
intelligently to its wearer's needs. For instance, as depth
increases, so does the pressure on the counterlung _ the flexible
bag that holds exhaled gas _ making it increasingly difficult for
the diver to exhale. Clarke and his colleagues have patented a
device, similar to a hospital ventilator, that reduces the load on
the counterlung to keep breathing free and easy.
 &HT;    Farther ahead, Clarke and engineer John Mittleman of the Navy's
Coastal Systems Station in Panama City envision placing
micro-machines in the rebreather, on the diver's skin, or even
inside the diver's body. These tiny devices could collect precise
data on oxygen and carbon-dioxide levels and signal any trouble.
 &HT;    ``That could be his warning to do something different _ maybe
start breathing harder, or come up into more shallow waters,''
Clarke says.
 &HT;    In the farther future, engineers are working on devices that
pull oxygen directly from the water, much as a fish does, so a
diver might never run out of breath. Japanese engineers recently
found an effective way to separate the hydrogen and oxygen
molecules in water using light.
 &HT;    Heerschap says rebreathers might someday incorporate a version
of this technology: ``If so, the rebreather could be reduced to the
size of a small backpack, with only scrubbing material and sensors
and no oxygen tanks.''
 &HT;    Explorers of the deep briny blue aren't the only ones who will
benefit from advances in rebreathers. Mountain climbers also waste
a lot of oxygen each time they exhale. New technology could
drastically cut the number of 30-pound oxygen tanks climbers have
to haul up a mountain.
 &HT;    Similarly, rebreathers could lighten the load of firefighters,
search-and-rescue teams, and hazardous-materials workers.
 &HT;    And rebreathers might be the key to conquering outer space. The
challenge of life support in a vacuum is not much different from
that of survival 300 feet underwater, In fact, the space shuttle's
extravehicular-activity suit is essentially an extremely fancy,
modified rebreather. But, in true NASA style, it costs tens of
millions of dollars and cannot be fixed while in orbit.
 &HT;    Stone predicts that a decade from now commercial space explorers
will don drastically cheaper suits containing off-the-shelf
replaceable parts derived from commercial rebreathers. The suits
will have flexible exoskeletons and low internal pressures, giving
tomorrow's astronauts the dexterity of today's divers.
 &HT;    When that day comes, Stone says, ``space suits will simply be
another item of gear from the orbital equipment supply catalog.''

 (One color slide is included.) 
 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Ever since Julius Caesar decreed that the empire of Rome should
follow a solar calendar rather than ancient lunar calendars,
mankind has been ever so slightly out of sync with the moon.
 &HT;    August 2000 marks one of those rare occasions when the calendar
happens to neatly coincide with a full 29.5-day lunar cycle,
beginning with a hair-thin crescent that will wax into a brilliant
full moon at midmonth and fully wane on the 29th.
 &HT;    Sculptured around the phases of the moon, this month is a good
time to pay homage to our nearest heavenly neighbor.
 &HT;    The moon tends to loom very large in the mind's eye, but in fact
it would take 105,050 objects of the same size to completely fill
the sky.
 &HT;    Its brightness is something of an illusion as well. Because we
never step directly from sunlight to moonlight, gauging the
difference in intensity is difficult.
 &HT;    Surprisingly, the sun is 450,000 times brighter than the full
moon. Our satellite's surface is as dark as asphalt. Still, the
moon, as it nears its full phase this month, will be dazzling
enough to wash out the famous Perseid meteors, beloved by summer
campers and country vacationers.
 &HT;    Those sky watchers who linger by their campfires will see the
same lunar hemisphere that humans have gazed upon since time
immemorial.
 &HT;    The moon shows us only one face because it rotates on its axis
in the same period that it orbits Earth. The speed of the slow
axial spin is just 10 mph at the equator. A jogger perpetually
circumnavigating the moon in the right direction would never see
the sun rise or set.
 &HT;    If the moon behaved like every other major satellite in the
solar system and orbited over the equator of its mother planet, it
would traverse Orion's Belt each month.
 &HT;    Instead, it ignores Earth's tilt and revolves around the globe
in the same plane as the planets, taking it through the zodiac
constellations and delivering vivid planetary conjunctions, like
its striking predawn meeting with Jupiter and Saturn on Aug. 23.
 &HT;    Even the slant of the moon is unusual. It stands straight up
relative to the sun; this lack of tilt allows depressions at the
poles to remain permanently shadowed. Those dark regions are cold
enough that they might conceal billions of tons of ice locked away
in deep freeze, a convenient water source that may drastically
change the course of future space exploration.
 &HT;    The moon's battered surface is covered with a soil of
talcum-powder softness. The silicon-oxygen mix of the rocks below
closely matches the composition of Earth's crust and mantle _ so
closely that scientists now believe the moon must have once been a
piece of our own planet, blown into space by a spectacular
collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body.
 &HT;    The moon's core is solid, essentially one giant crystal. This
causes our natural satellite to keep shaking whenever a large
meteor or unmanned spacecraft collides with it. At such times the
entire moon rings for hours like an enormous gong.
 &HT;    Luckily, sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space.
Otherwise, our noisy neighbor might keep us awake on those nights
when we'd just as soon have moon shadows follow us in our dreams.

 &HT;    New Shakespeare biography written for the general audience
 &HT;    ``WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE: The Man Behindthe Genius,'' by Anthony
Holden. Little, Brown; 367 pages; $29.95.
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Anthony Holden dispenses with the
primary idiocy right out of the box, as he confidently asserts that
no one but Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   To imagine that the tight little world of Elizabethan theater _
300 people? 500 people? _ would lovingly embrace someone they
couldn't have helped knowing was a front without enthusiastically
blowing his cover is to have no concept of what vicious, backbiting
spoilsports writers really are.
</P>
<P>
   If Shakespeare was a fraud, then Ben Jonson's moving
remembrances were lies, and the friends who lovingly gathered their
old friend's manuscripts and published them seven years after his
death were merely engaged in an expensive and pointless charade
calculated to throw all but cranky eccentrics off the track.
</P>
<P>
   It won't make any difference, of course; for a conspiracy
theorist, logic is just the most insidious part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, here is a sprightly biography of Shakespeare
written for a general audience. Its author has previously written
biographies of Olivier, Tchaikovsky, Prince Charles and that
ubiquitous subject for all U.K. journalists, Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Holden is sensible and occasionally amusing as he punctures the
premises of the anti-Stratfordians. The conspiracy theorists have
always held that Shakespeare couldn't have written the plays
because he couldn't have done the vast amounts of traveling
necessary to investigate the locales.
</P>
<P>
   Holden points out that he managed to set two plays in Venice
without ever mentioning that the streets were full of water.
</P>
<P>
   Holden takes a couple of things as given that, last time I
checked, were still suppositional _ the extent of Shakespeare's
contributions to plays by other writers, and the possibility of
some manuscript pages from a play called ``Sir Thomas More'' being
in his hand. Aside from the similarity in handwriting to his
signatures, there is the teasingly interesting misspelling of
silence as ``scilens'' _ the same eccentric spelling found in the
speech prefixes for Justice Silence in an early folio of ``Henry
IV, Part 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden also gives surprising credence to the poet laureate
William Davenant's claim that Shakespeare was not merely his
godfather but his father. (George Bernard Shaw believed that
Davenant's mother Jeannette, a reputedly beautiful woman, was the
Dark Lady of the sonnets.)
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Holden emphasizes Shakespeare's sophistication _
shrewdly able to plunge into the mind of every one of his
characters, but also a man who lived in the world.
</P>
<P>
   While writing an average of two plays a year, Shakespeare was
also juggling a wife, mistresses, a large circle of friends and
co-workers, and amassing an estate that included a piece of the
Globe theater, real estate ventures in London and Stratford and a
little money-lending on the side.
</P>
<P>
   By around 1599, Shakespeare would have been earning about 200
pounds a year from the theater alone; by the time he turned 40,
Shakespeare could have afforded to retire completely, but he kept
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Holden points out how assiduously Shakespeare stole plots, but
``as always with Shakespeare, close comparison of the text and its
sources show his pillaging to be the prelude to layer upon layer of
miraculous enlargement, as often mundane details are reworked into
far more subtle, ingenious effects in a far grander scheme ... this
is the hallmark of the genius drily noted by T.S. Eliot: `Immature
poets imitate; mature poets steal.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are some amusing contributions from Peter O'Toole, a
friend of the author, who doesn't believe the oft-repeated line
about Shakespeare being a mediocre actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get billing as a tragedian with the King's Men
unless you could act,'' says O'Toole, who has a hunch Shakespeare
played Mercutio.
</P>
<P>
   Where Holden's book falls down is in the spaces between the
facts. The gaps in the historical record in Shakespeare's life _
which are by no means extreme, by the way; we know more about him
than any other Elizabethan writer save Ben Jonson _ are not
problems for a biographer as much as opportunities: the equivalent
of a musician getting a chance to improvise a solo on themes set
out in a symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where a creative mind can show off, as with Anthony
Burgess' and Robert Payne's biographies from 25 years ago. But
Holden lacks imagination. He can dutifully narrate, make the
connections between the historical record and the plays, but he
can't entrance us with his own particular take on these people in
their time.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Holden never makes a fool out of himself, as
writers who put more of an emphasis on empathetic leaps than
research are wont to do, but it also means his Shakespeare doesn't
dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Stratford man did nothing else, he dazzled.

10 QUESTIONS PHYSICISTS HOPE TO ANSWER BY THE YEAR 3000
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif.)  By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Who of us would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the
future lies hidden; to cast a glance at the next advances of our
science and at the secrets of its development during future
centuries?''
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago, with those inviting thoughts, the German
mathematician David Hilbert opened his landmark address to the
International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, laying out 23 of
the great unsolved problems of the day. ``For the close of a great
epoch,'' Hilbert declared, ``not only invites us to look back into
the past but also directs our thoughts to the unknown future.''
</P>
<P>
   With another century ending _ a whole millennium in fact _ the
pressure is all the greater to tabulate human ignorance with lists
of the most enticing cosmic mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Mass.,
emulated Hilbert, announcing (in Paris, for full effect) seven
``Millennium Prize Problems,'' each with a bounty of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The list is at: www.claymath.org/prize(underscore)problems/.
</P>
<P>
   And last month physicists, with a typically lighter touch, ended
a conference on superstring theory at the University of Michigan
with a session called ``Millennium Madness,'' choosing 10 of the
most perplexing problems in their field. It was like a desert
island game, involving some of science's smartest people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I thought about this challenge was to imagine what
question I would ask if I woke up from a coma 100 years from now,''
said Dr. David Gross, a theoretical physicist at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, as he unveiled the winners. He and the
other judges made the selection, he noted, ``in the middle and
after this party in which we were sufficiently drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeding out unanswerable questions (like ``How do you get
tenure?''), the judges came up with enough puzzles to occupy
physicists for the next century or so. There are no monetary
prizes, though solving any one of these would almost guarantee a
trip to Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   1. Are all the (measurable) dimensionless parameters that
characterize the physical universe calculable in principle or are
some merely determined by historical or quantum mechanical accident
and uncalculable?
</P>
<P>
   Einstein put it more crisply: Did God have a choice in creating
the universe? Imagine the Old One sitting at his control console,
preparing to set off the Big Bang. ``How fast should I set the
speed of light?'' ``How much charge should I give this little speck
called an electron?'' ``What value should I give to Planck's
constant, the parameter that determines the size of the tiny
packets _ the quanta _ in which energy shall be parceled?'' Was he
randomly dashing off numbers to meet a deadline? Or do the values
have to be what they are because of a deep, hidden logic?
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of questions come to a point with a conundrum
involving a mysterious number called alpha. If you square the
charge of the electron and then divide it by the speed of light
times Planck's constant, all the dimensions (mass, time and
distance) cancel out, yielding a so-called ``pure number'' _ alpha,
which is just slightly over 1/137. But why is it not precisely
1/137 or some other value entirely? Physicists and even mystics
have tried in vain to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   2. How can quantum gravity help explain the origin of the
universe?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the great theories of modern physics are the standard
model, which uses quantum mechanics to describe the subatomic
particles and the forces they obey, and general relativity, the
theory of gravity. Physicists have long hoped that merging the two
into a ``theory of everything'' _ quantum gravity _ would yield a
deeper understanding of the universe, including how it
spontaneously popped into existence with the Big Bang. The leading
candidate for this merger is superstring theory, or M theory, as
the latest, souped-up version is called (with the M standing for
``magic,'' ``mystery,'' or ``mother of all theories'').
</P>
<P>
   3. What is the lifetime of the proton and how do we understand
it?
</P>
<P>
   It used to be considered gospel that protons, unlike, say,
neutrons, live forever, never decaying into smaller pieces. Then in
the 1970s, theorists realized that their candidates for a grand
unified theory, merging all the forces except gravity, implied that
protons must be unstable. Wait long enough and, very occasionally,
one should break down.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to catch it in the act. Sitting in underground
laboratories, shielded from cosmic rays and other disturbances,
experimenters have whiled away the years watching large tanks of
water, waiting for a proton inside one of the atoms to give up the
ghost. So far the fatality rate is zero, meaning that either
protons are perfectly stable or their lifetime is enormous _ an
estimated billion trillion trillion years or more.
</P>
<P>
   4. Is nature supersymmetric, and if so, how is supersymmetry
broken?
</P>
<P>
   Many physicists believe that unifying all the forces, including
gravity, into a single theory would require showing that two very
different kinds of particles are actually intimately related, a
phenomenon called supersymmetry.
</P>
<P>
   The first, fermions, are loosely described as the building
blocks of matter, like protons, electrons and neutrons. They clump
together to make stuff. The others, the bosons, are the particles
that carry forces, like photons, conveyors of light. With
supersymmetry, every fermion would have a boson twin, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists, with their compulsion for coining funny names, call
the so-called superpartners ``sparticles'': For the electron, there
would be the selectron; for the photon, the photino. But since the
sparticles have not been observed in nature, physicists would also
have to explain why, in the jargon, the symmetry is ``broken'': The
mathematical perfection that existed at the moment of creation was
knocked out of kilter as the universe cooled and congealed into its
present lopsided state.
</P>
<P>
   5. Why does the universe appear to have one time and three space
dimensions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because'' is not considered an acceptable answer. And
just because people can't imagine moving in extra directions,
beyond up-and-down, left-and-right, and back-and-forth, doesn't
mean that the universe had to be designed that way. According to
superstring theory, in fact, there must be six more spatial
dimensions, each one curled up too tiny to detect. If the theory is
right, then why did only three of them unfurl, leaving us with this
comparatively claustrophobic dominion?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   6. Why does the cosmological constant have the value that it
has? Is it zero and is it really constant?
</P>
<P>
   Until recently cosmologists thought the universe was expanding
at a steady clip. But recent observations indicate that the
expansion may be getting faster and faster. This slight
acceleration is described by a number called the cosmological
constant. Whether the constant turns out to be zero, as earlier
believed, or some very tiny number, physicists are at a loss to
explain why.
</P>
<P>
   According to some fundamental calculations, it should be huge _
some 10 to 122 times as big as has been observed. The universe, in
other words, should be ballooning in leaps and bounds. Since it is
not, there must be some mechanism suppressing the effect. If the
universe were perfectly supersymmetric, the cosmological constant
would become canceled out entirely. But since the symmetry, if it
exists at all, appears to be broken, the constant would still
remain far too large. Things would get even more confusing if the
constant turned out to vary over time.
</P>
<P>
   7. What are the fundamental degrees of freedom of M theory (the
theory whose low-energy limit is eleven-dimensional supergravity
and that subsumes the five consistent superstring theories) and
does the theory describe nature?
</P>
<P>
   For years, one big strike against superstring theory was that
there were five versions. Which, if any, described the universe?
The rivals have been recently reconciled into an overarching
11-dimensional framework called M theory, but only by introducing
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Before M theory, all the subatomic particles were said to be
made from tiny superstrings. M theory adds to the subatomic mix
even weirder objects called ``branes'' _ like membranes but with as
many as nine dimensions. The question now is, Which is more
fundamental _ are strings made from branes or vice versa? Or is
there something else even more basic that no one has thought of
yet? Finally, is any of this real, or is M theory just a
fascinating mind game?
</P>
<P>
   8. What is the resolution of the black hole information paradox?
</P>
<P>
   According to quantum theory, information _ whether it describes
the velocity of a particle or the precise manner in which ink marks
or pixels are arranged on a document _ cannot disappear from the
universe. But the physicists Kip Thorne, John Preskill and Stephen
Hawking have a standing bet: What would happen if you dropped a
copy of the Encyclopaedia Britannica down a black hole? It does not
matter whether there are other identical copies elsewhere in the
cosmos. As defined in physics, information is not the same as
meaning, but simply refers to the binary digits, or some other
code, used to precisely describe an object or pattern. So it seems
that the information in those particular books would be swallowed
up and gone forever. And that is supposed to be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking and Thorne believe the information would indeed
disappear and that quantum mechanics will just have to deal with
it. Preskill speculates that the information doesn't really vanish:
It may be displayed somehow on the surface of the black hole, as on
a cosmic movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   9. What physics explains the enormous disparity between the
gravitational scale and the typical mass scale of the elementary
particles?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, why is gravity so much weaker than the other
forces, like electromagnetism? A magnet can pick up a paper clip
even though the gravity of the whole earth is pulling back on the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   According to one recent proposal, gravity is actually much
stronger. It just seems weak because most of it is trapped in one
of those extra dimensions. If its full force could be tapped using
high-powered particle accelerators, it might be possible to create
miniature black holes. Though seemingly of interest to the solid
waste disposal industry, the black holes would probably evaporate
almost as soon as they were formed.
</P>
<P>
   10. Can we quantitatively understand quark and gluon confinement
in quantum chromodynamics and the existence of a mass gap?
</P>
<P>
   Quantum chromodynamics, or QCD, is the theory describing the
strong nuclear force. Carried by gluons, it binds quarks into
particles like protons and neutrons. According to the theory, the
tiny subparticles are permanently confined. You can't pull a quark
or a gluon from a proton because the strong force gets stronger
with distance and snaps them right back inside.
</P>
<P>
   But physicists have yet to prove conclusively that quarks and
gluons can never escape. When they try to do so, the calculations
go haywire. And they cannot explain why all particles that feel the
strong force must have at least a tiny amount of mass, why it
cannot be zero. Some hope to find an answer in M theory, maybe one
that would also throw more light on the nature of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   11. (Question added in translation). Why is any of this
important?
</P>
<P>
   In presenting his own list of mysteries, Hilbert put it this
way: ``It is by the solution of problems that the investigator
tests the temper of his steel; he finds new methods and new
outlooks, and gains a wider and freer horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   And in physics, the horizon is no less than a theory that
finally makes sense of the universe.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abby Bernstein feels as if she has been told that she has just
about every ailment in the book. Over the past 12 years, dozens of
medical specialists have informed her that she has the flu, drug
allergies, mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus, a gallbladder problem
and even food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, she has been told several times that she has
absolutely nothing, despite chronic bouts of nausea, fever,
fatigue, skin lesions and swelling in nearly every joint in her
body, including her jaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a doctor's nightmare,'' said Bernstein, a 41-year-old
legislative director for a union in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bernstein knows differently. She suffers from two distinct
disorders _ autoimmune hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. What
these two illnesses have in common is that they are both autoimmune
diseases, part of a large family of disorders, which, according to
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, strike an
estimated 14 million Americans. Some estimates run as high as 50
million. The vast majority of those afflicted are women.
</P>
<P>
   Though the causes remain unclear, autoimmune diseases are set
off when an out-of-control immune system causes the body to attack
its own tissues. The diseases can attack the skin, nervous system,
the joints and any of the organs. They include the familiar
(rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus,
psoriasis and Graves' disease) and the obscure (autoimmune
hepatitis, Sjogren's syndrome and polymyositis).
</P>
<P>
   Like Bernstein, people with autoimmune disorders often move from
doctor to doctor, trying to piece together the confusing puzzle of
symptoms, which sometimes disappear as quickly as they come. Even
after an autoimmune disorder is diagnosed, patients can often do
little beyond treating the various symptoms of the disease. And
diagnosis, the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association
says, takes an average of five years and seven doctors.
</P>
<P>
   And, more confusingly, new research points out that many, if not
most, people who have an autoimmune disease have more than one,
which may require treatment by many different specialists and a
number of medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to, I could quit my job and just go to the doctor
every day,'' Bernstein said. ``But at this point I know more than
they do. The one who's really managing my care is me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite confusion about the diseases, some doctors are looking
at the disorders as a group and focusing on their connection _ an
overactive immune system. More experts are linking them in
diagnosis and prescribing treatments that work for more than one
disorder, and researchers are studying the immune system for a
common cause, and, eventually, a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These various illnesses have the same etiology, and we should
group them together the way we do with different cancers,'' said
Virginia Ladd, the president of the autoimmune disease association,
an advocacy organization in Eastpointe, Mich. ``But unfortunately,
we have no autoimmunologists, no autoimmune clinics and no
autoimmune department in institutions. Things are changing but it
can still end up being very frustrating for patients and their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   When the immune system is functioning properly, its job is to
ward off invaders like viruses and bacteria. In people with an
autoimmune disease, however, the immune system works overtime,
mistakes the body's own cells for intruders and assaults its own
cells and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Why the body would turn on itself remains unclear. But there are
theories. Some blame female hormones, particularly estrogen, which
may explain why autoimmune diseases are three times as common in
women as in men, especially women in the childbearing years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autoimmunity is basically a women's problem,'' explained Dr.
Michael D. Lockshin, the director of the Barbara Volcker Center for
Women and Rheumatic Disease at the Hospital for Special Surgery in
New York. ``For one, women have more vigorous immune responses.
Compared to men, they have a higher antibody response to the same
inciting agent, be it a virus, infection or a vaccination.''
</P>
<P>
   The menstrual cycle, with its hormonal ups and downs, also
creates monthly changes in a woman's immune system. Recently,
researchers have looked at how the immune system is affected during
and after pregnancy, a period marked by drastic hormonal swings.
During pregnancy, when estrogen levels are high, for example, the
immune system goes into a kind of ``sleep mode,'' mainly to prevent
the mother from rejecting her fetus. After delivery, the immune
system kicks in again, sometimes too much, which can result in an
autoimmune disorder, most commonly in the thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hormonal swings do not completely explain autoimmune
disorders and may even cloud the picture. For example, although
some autoimmune disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple
sclerosis, go into remission when a woman is pregnant, others, like
lupus, worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, viruses, bacteria, parasites, medication and even
stress can set off an autoimmune disease. It may be that one of
these agents causes inflammation, which somehow brings on an
autoimmune response. It is well established, for example, that a
bout of strep throat can set off rheumatic fever, an autoimmune
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A new theory, known as the hygiene hypothesis, postulates that
improvements in sanitary conditions, including the multitudes of
antibacterial products lining drugstore shelves, have somehow
caused immune systems to become hypersensitive to outside agents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The hygiene hypothesis is a popular and interesting theory,''
said Dr. Noel Rose, a professor of pathology and immunology at
Johns Hopkins. ``But there isn't much firm evidence to support it.
It could be that there is more autoimmune disease now because
people are living longer and have more time to manifest it. It
remains uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more clear is that genetics plays an important role.
``In the last five years, there has been increasing evidence that
autoimmune diseases run in families,'' said Ladd of the disease
association. ``And not just the same disease: In one family, the
mother could have lupus, the daughter Type 1 diabetes and the
sister psoriasis.'' Ladd, who has had lupus for more than 30 years,
notes that in her own family, 5 of 13 siblings have one type of
autoimmune disorder or another.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Catharine Shaner, 41, a pediatrician in Allentown, Pa.,
knows all too well the reality of inherited autoimmune disease. She
has both Sjogren's syndrome, marked by very dry eyes and mouth, and
fibromyalgia, which is strongly suspected to be autoimmune in
nature and causes fatigue and muscle pain. Laura, her 13-year-old
daughter, has rheumatoid arthritis. Between them, they see 15
doctors, and take 18 medicines a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, there's definitely a family connection,'' said Shaner,
who has had to quit her practice. ``Along with Laura and me, my
mother and one of my brothers have hypothyroidism.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, patients have been able to do little more
than find ways to ease their lists of symptoms. Some take a drug,
or several, to ease the pain and inflammation common to lupus,
rheumatoid arthritis and many other autoimmune disorders.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, like ibuprofen or stronger
prescription drugs, are extremely common, but they can also cause
stomach problems.
</P>
<P>
   The newer Cox-2 inhibitors also reduce swelling and are gentler
on the digestive system. Other patients take immunosuppressants,
like steroids, that offer a wholesale suppression of the immune
system, but these have more serious side effects. Still other
patients stick to treatments specific to their diseases, like
insulin for Type 1 diabetes or synthetic thyroid for autoimmune
thyroid disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists continue to discover treatments for
symptoms. For example, researchers reported recently in The New
England Journal of Medicine that human growth hormone, combined
with a high-protein diet, significantly eased symptoms of Crohn's
disease, which affects the digestive tract. And a number of
medications are in the works for lupus and psoriasis.
</P>
<P>
   Most encouraging have been two treatments belonging to a new
class of drugs called biologics. They work by taking aim at
specific proteins that, when overproduced, cause some autoimmune
diseases. For example, Enbrel, from the Immunex Corp., was approved
last year for rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis, and, according to patients and doctors, helps control
swelling and pain. Remicade, from Centocor Inc., is prescribed for
Crohn's and rheumatoid arthritis, disorders that affect different
body systems. It also shows promise for treating other autoimmune
diseases, including psoriasis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, patients are fighting to remain upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Shaner concluded: ``We are not crazy. We are not lazy. We are
people who need earlier diagnosing, better treatments, increased
effort by employers to keep us in the workplace and a real attempt
to unearth the underlying malfunction behind our symptoms. And we
need it now.''

<P>
   SARDIS, Turkey _ In the ruins of Sardis, capital of the Lydians
of yore, archaeologists are striving to separate fact from legend,
seeking glimpses of what it meant in antiquity to be ``rich as
Croesus.'' But they are also finding much more: monumental remains
of the passage of time and fortune for a major city under
subsequent Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine rule.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the slopes of a broad river valley about 50 miles
inland from the Aegean Sea, in what is now western Turkey but was
then known as Asia Minor, King Croesus reigned in the sixth century
B.C. over the flourishing empire of Lydia. The Lydians were dreaded
warriors on horse and chariot, controlling the middle ground
between the Greeks to the west and marauding nomads and surging
empires, notably the Persians, in the east. They were enterprising
in commerce, and their streams seemed to run with gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sardis rich in gold,'' Aeschylus wrote. Greek literature for
generations held up Croesus as a symbol of enormous wealth but one
whose gold could not assure him happiness or ultimate success. His
golden reputation, if little else of Lydia, survives to this day,
and has drawn archaeologists of the Harvard-Cornell Sardis
Expedition to this storied site each summer for the last 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the archaeologists have not found hoards of gold or
splendid palaces, the stuff of dreams, expedition leaders now think
they have established that the gold of Lydia is no legend. It was
definitely in ancient Sardis in the time of Croesus, they have
determined, that the first coins of pure gold and pure silver were
struck, an important step leading to a monetary economy as it is
practiced today.
</P>
<P>
   After a comprehensive analysis of gold-refining furnaces,
hearths and other artifacts at the site, Dr. Andrew Ramage, a
Cornell archaeologist and associate director of the expedition,
concluded, ``We can confirm the hypothesis that the Lydians under
Croesus initiated the bimetallic system of coinage, and even
propose that the Sardis refining installations made this
introduction possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific examination of the gold refinery, the
expedition's most significant discovery to date, is described and
interpreted in ``King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the
History of Gold Refining,'' written by Ramage and Dr. Paul T.
Craddock, a specialist in metallurgy at the British Museum in
London, and published in May by Harvard University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have generally supposed that the Lydians were the first
to invent coins of gold and of silver, but have argued over when it
happened _ perhaps it occurred after Croesus, under Persian rule of
Sardis _ and over how the Lydians were able to render raw gold into
a pure state.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Middle East had begun to use measured amounts of
precious metals as payment or expressions of wealth at least 2,000
years before Croesus. At some point in the seventh century B.C.,
Ramage noted, the Lydians got the idea of creating and marking
small lumps of electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver, at
consistent weights. They may have done this as a convenient means
of paying their mercenary soldiers. The drawback of such coins,
however, was that the amount of the more prized gold in them often
varied. One could never be sure of the coin's true value.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOLDEN TECHNOLOGY: Near Perfection From Raw Metal
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all raw gold, the metal the people of Sardis panned
for in the Pactolus and other nearby rivers came mixed with silver
and traces of copper. The new evidence, Ramage and Craddock said,
shows how the Lydians placed the raw material in small bowl-shaped
hearths in the ground and, fanning hot coals with bellows, heated
it in combination with lead to remove the trace metals. Then the
remaining material, mixed with common salt, was subjected to
prolonged heating in earthenware vessels until the gold was
completely separated from the silver.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he would have liked to have found something like the
royal treasury, Ramage wrote, ``This offers more of a challenge
than admiring the superb finish or awesome weight of the worked
products, because one can now wonder at the imagination required to
bring the unlikely-looking raw material to a usable form, and at
the skill required to produce gold of an almost perfect fineness.''
</P>
<P>
   The dating of materials found at the gold refinery and other
circumstantial evidence, Ramage and Craddock said, put the most
likely time of this technological advance during the reign of
Croesus, between 561 and his defeat at the hands of Cyrus the Great
of Persia in 547.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first excavations of the gold refinery, beginning in
1968, several generations of archaeologists and their students have
also labored under the baking summer sun trying to learn more about
Lydian Sardis. This summer, expedition leaders said they had made
great strides at last in tracing the defensive walls that enclosed
the city center at the time of Croesus. Near one part of the wall,
they found a kind of time capsule: rooms of a Lydian house,
including a kitchen with cooking and dinnerware as they were the
day Cyrus seized the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting work now is finding and exploring the city
wall of the Lydian period,'' Ramage said. ``Now we know there was a
wall for the lower city, not just the acropolis. And now we have an
assemblage of everyday wares that should help us understand what it
was like in the time of Croesus.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE FRUSTRATIONS: Ruins Beneath Ruins, Delay After Delay
</P>
<P>
   But the expedition has experienced its share of frustration and
disappointment, common tests of an archaeologist's necessary
capacity for patience.
</P>
<P>
   One enduring frustration is that most of the Lydian city ruins
lie under what archaeologists call an ``overburden.'' Lydian Sardis
is buried deep under silt, landslide debris and the stones of Roman
and Byzantine construction closer to the surface. Excavators are
always encountering something non-Lydian, causing delays and
diversions from their original objective.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Temple of Artemis, uncovered by a Princeton University
expedition in the early 20th century, was buried up to the capitals
of its stately Ionic columns. Digging for Lydia had to wait. With
other discoveries, like buried remains of a Greek stadium and
theater, archaeologists chose to forgo excavations and press on
with the Lydian quest.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, most of the ruins visible at Sardis have been of
Roman origin, notably the magnificent baths and gymnasium near the
main highway through the current village of Sart. Studying these
ruins proved to be a time-consuming diversion, but this did lead to
finding in the vicinity a second century A.D. synagogue, the
largest known in the world at that time. A discovery like that
could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Crawford H. Greenewalt Jr., an archaeologist at the
University of California at Berkeley and the expedition's field
director, shook his head in exasperation over the unfulfilled
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we not finding any sumptuary art?'' he asked, and by
his tone, the lack of lavish art from palaces was clearly a
question that has troubled archaeologists for years. ``We are not
digging in the center of Sardis, but on the periphery, because
everything in the center is all deeply buried, with Roman and
Byzantine ruins closer to the top. We are not digging graves, which
often yield rich goods. But they've all been robbed long ago,
especially the royal burial mounds across the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DISCOVERIES: Glimmers of the Booty Of Ravenous Looters
</P>
<P>
   Some Lydian gold has come to light. The Princeton expedition
found a vase full of gold coins. Looters seized gold and silver
jewelry and bronze objects from tombs near the Turkish city of
Usak. The so-called Lydian Hoard showed up on the international
market and much of it was legitimately acquired through gifts by
the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan. In 1993, the museum agreed to
give the material back to the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the triumphant Persians, as well as succeeding
conquerors, were responsible for the scarcity of gold and other
possessions of Croesus. A story by the Greek historian Herodotus,
writing in the fifth century B.C., suggests the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Croesus, watching Persian soldiers sack the city, is supposed to
have asked Cyrus, ``What is it that all those men of yours are so
intent upon doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus replied: ``They are plundering your city and carrying off
your treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Croesus corrected him: ``Not my city or my treasures. Nothing
there any longer belongs to me. It is you they are robbing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Persians presumably left the city's royal palace
standing; it was still in use in Roman times. By all Greek
accounts, the palace was truly sumptuous, and everything about it
left the Greeks with conflicting views of Croesus and the Lydians.
(What the Lydians thought of the Greeks will probably never be
known, for only 115 Lydian texts have survived and they are mostly
formulaic gravestone inscriptions.)
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks were envious of the Lydians' wealth and power and
admiring of their stand against Eastern hordes and their generous
gifts to Greek temples in Delphi and Ephesus. ``The loving kindness
of Croesus fadeth not away,'' wrote the poet Pindar.
</P>
<P>
   But the Greeks also assumed an air of moral superiority. Their
stories implied that the self-indulgent Lydians _ the men, it was
said, wore earrings and fancy tunics _ had grown soft and brought
their downfall on themselves. Had not the Greeks of more moderate
means and modest tastes eventually beaten back the advancing
Persians?
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is best expressed in another story by Herodotus,
later retold by Plutarch. It is about a visit the philosopher Solon
is supposed to have made to Croesus; never mind that Solon, having
died just before Croesus ascended the throne, probably never made
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   After Solon toured the royal treasury and palace, Croesus asked,
``Who is the happiest man you have ever seen?'' Thinking himself
the happiest man in the world, he was furious when Solon named a
lowly Athenian who had a loving family and had died bravely in
battle for his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you asked me I will not answer until I know you
have died happily,'' Solon explained. ``Look to the end, no matter
what it is you are considering. Often enough, God gives a man a
glimpse of happiness, and then utterly ruins him.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Croesus lost his son and heir in an accident,
and then lost everything to the Persians. When he was about to be
burned to death, Croesus cried out three times, `` O Solon!'' When
Cyrus inquired what man or god he invoked, Croesus told him the
entire story, and his life was spared.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE SEARCH: Of Elusive Palaces And Sensitive Nerves
</P>
<P>
   But the palace of Croesus, why have archaeologists failed so far
to turn up such a potentially rich find?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're touching a sensitive nerve,'' Greenewalt said.
``Wherever the palace is, it does not stand out in the topography.
Other places, we see a mound and know where to look. It may be
under central Sardis, which is so deeply buried and also built over
by the modern village. If we knew where it was, we would certainly
go for it, but we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointments, the expedition has scored enough
tantalizing discoveries to keep coming back year after year. One
find, the rooms of a Lydian house, were being investigated this
summer. The house, lying underneath Roman ruins, probably collapsed
in the destruction of the city by the Persians. Among the broken
pottery, glass and loom weights, a human skeleton lay on the packed
dirt floor. In the kitchen were carbonized garlic and chick peas,
evidence that fire swept vanquished Sardis.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Tumay Asena, a graduate student at Bilkent
University in Ankara, took a trowel and sliced some dirt away from
an iron object. At first, he thought he had found an iron knife.
With a little more digging, it looked more like a sword. A couple
of days later, the object proved to be neither knife nor sword, but
some piece of household hardware that Asena was at a loss to
identify. Even the simplest artifacts do not yield readily to
probing archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with his back to an olive grove, Dr. Nicholas Cahill,
an archaeologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison,
supervised local workers digging at the Lydian city wall. They have
uncovered skeletons of a middle-aged man and a young man who was
probably a soldier, his iron helmet near him.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have learned to distinguish the Lydian city walls
from later ones, Cahill pointed out. The Lydians built with unfired
mud brick laid on top of stone foundations without mortar, in
contrast to Roman mortar-and-stone and fired-brick construction.
But Lydian walls were substantial: about 60 feet thick at the base
and at least 20 feet high, the western wall appears to have run
down a ridge from the top of the acropolis to the lower city.
</P>
<P>
   At the eastern wall, about half-mile away, Christopher
Roosevelt, a Cornell graduate student and a great-grandson of
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, pointed to stacks of Lydian
mud brick there, which time had left barely distinguishable from
ordinary earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things,'' he said. ``If you know what you're
looking for, mud brick, you begin to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only segments of the Lydian wall have been uncovered,
Greenewalt said, ``We have enough to establish the circuit of the
wall well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DROP OF GOLD: A Sparkling Sample Of Croesus' Glory
</P>
<P>
   Back at the excavation house, a compound of offices, workshops,
storage depots, a dining room and living quarters under the shade
of tall pines, young conservators worked at cleaning and piecing
together the stones of a menorah from the synagogue. They were also
making broken pottery whole. Archaeologists have been struck by the
strong Greek influence on Lydian ceramics and other artifacts. This
may not be surprising since Lydian kings had extensive trade with
Greek cities like Ephesus and Smyrna (modern Izmir) not far away
and sometimes held political sway there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greekness of Lydian culture is something archaeology has
confirmed and clarified,'' Greenewalt said.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Greenewalt held a show-and-tell at a table in the
compound's courtyard. Out of a box he pulled a glassified brick
from a refinery furnace, a lump of lead oxide slag and then a pot
used in the process of separating gold from silver. Lastly, he
invited inspection of a piece of gray slag with a magnifying glass.
Flecks of mica sparkled. Then a couple of the tiniest drops of
yellow caught the light.
</P>
<P>
   Gold?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Greenewalt said. ``You have now seen Croesus' gold.''

A WAY TO BUILD A BETTER ANTIBIOTIC
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at Yale, led by Dr. Thomas A. Steitz, a professor of
molecular biophysics and biochemistry, have figured out the
three-dimensional structure of a ribosome, a part in cells that
constructs proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported in the current issue of Science, cast
insight into the evolution of the very earliest life on earth and
offer a new avenue of research for developing antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   A ribosome consists of two parts: One reads protein-building
instructions transcribed from the cell's DNA and encoded in strands
of ribonucleic acid, or RNA; the other builds the proteins. The
Yale researchers looked at the protein-building part of the
ribosome of a bacterium found in the Dead Sea. However, ribosomes
work similarly in almost all creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you understand how one ribosome works, you understand how
all ribosomes in all cells work,'' Steitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed picture, showing the positions of 100,000 atoms,
should aid drug researchers in designing antibiotics that latch
onto and foul up the ribosomes of attacking bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures also show that the active parts of the ribosome
structure are made of RNA, seen in gray, and not proteins, seen in
yellow. That supports the theory that the earliest life was based
solely on RNA, without proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In a modern-day cell, the main role of RNA is to transcribe
protein-making instructions from DNA, located in the nucleus, to
the ribosomes, located in the outer part of the cell.

10 NATIONS TO BUILD A GIANT TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers have signed an agreement to build a radio telescope
that would, in effect, be 100 times as large as today's largest.
</P>
<P>
   The plans were announced on Aug. 2 by scientists from 10
countries at the International Astronomical Union General Assembly
in Britain. They said they hoped to come up with a design and
location for the telescope by 2005 and to finish construction by
2015.
</P>
<P>
   The installation is likely to consist of 10 individual radio
telescopes spread over thousands of miles but connected by
computers and high-speed data links. The resulting system, called
the Square Kilometer Array, because it will have a collecting area
measuring one square kilometer, or the equivalent of nine football
fields, would act as one enormous telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the installation sprang from astronomers' desire to
study faint emissions from hydrogen gas structures formed soon
after the Big Bang, the theorized explosion that gave birth to the
universe. The scientists said they hoped it would help answer the
most fundamental questions about the universe, like how it took
shape and its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Radio telescopes have a big advantage over optical telescopes
because they can pick up radio waves despite cosmic dust, which
sometimes obscures light from galaxies and regions where stars are
forming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the radio telescopes in use today were designed in the
'60s and '70s before today's technological advances,'' said Dr.
Seth Shostak of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, a
privately financed effort to detect evidence of life elsewhere in
the universe, one of the groups that will use the telescope.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bye, bye Clintonn

Cox staff and wire reports.)

   Even as he said to expect no surprises from his final address as
his party's leader, President Clinton hinted that tonight's speech
will not be tame. The address, the main event on opening night of
the Democratic National Convention, will include a partisan rebuke
of Republican claims that Clinton deserves little credit for the
economy, aides said. ``I think Republicans may have had a little
amnesia about where things stood in 1992. The president will be
happy to remind people about that,'' said White House chief of
staff John Podesta. Clinton will also spend equal time praising Al
Gore's qualifications as a partner in prosperity. Soon after, he
will leave town. The president knows ``it's his moment to get off
the stage and let someone else get on the stage and do the job,''
Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   HELLO HILLARY
</P>
<P>
   As her husband prepares for his political farewell to the party
faithful today, Hillary Clinton is making her debut at the
Democratic convention as the first family's new candidate. The
first lady's prime-time, 10-minute address to the convention will
precede President Clinton's appearance _ a to-die-for spot for any
fledgling candidate. She is running for the U.S. Senate from New
York. The first lady declined to talk about the speech saying,
``I've got to go work on it.'' But she did say she would talk about
the progress made over the last eight years and ``make the case
that Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are the leaders for the 21st
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW ABOUT A JUST LITTLE HUMOR?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, preparing the most important speech of his life, said
he is cramming it with detailed proposals for the future and
counting on the voters to welcome that approach because ``the
people of the country want the facts. People who want the facts
will get them in this speech. If you want a show without facts
then, you know, that can be found somewhere else,'' Gore said. The
vice president, who is on the campaign trail headed toward the
convention where he will accept his party's nomination Thursday
night, said he was writing the speech himself, spelling out his
plans on tax cuts and Social Security. ``It is a gamble but it
doesn't worry me because I think in the final analysis ... people
deserve to know what the specifics are so they can judge for
themselves,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   OCCIDENTS HAPPEN
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of activists angered by an oil company's plans to drill
near a Colombian Indian reserve and Al Gore's ties to that company
marched today to the site of the Democratic convention.
Demonstrators carried a series of giant papier mache puppets, some
of them an unflattering rendering of Gore. Others carried a banner
reading, ``Mother Earth Rocks, Corporate Greed Sucks.'' During his
campaign, Gore has been dogged by protesters upset about his
connection to Occidental Petroleum Corp. They have urged him to
divest his family of the stock, worth as much as $500,000, which
was among the assets Gore inherited from his father who died last
December. Later today, activists plan a march by ``Billionaires for
Bush (or Gore).'' So far, the protests at the convention have been
raucous, but largely peaceful. A 12-foot-tall fence separates the
official protest area from the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   OOPS, BUSTED!
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats open their convention today, George W. Bush
will be at his ranch in Texas where he will spend several days in
strategy and policy meetings preparing for the fall campaign. Bush
suspended active campaigning yesterday to lie low for the
convention and added that he may not watch or listen to it. ``I
already know what they are going to say about me. They've been
saying it for the last six months. It's predictable,'' Bush said.
Bush noted that he would not watch the convention, in part, because
he does not have cable TV. When reporters suggested that he could
get parts of it on regular television and perhaps radio, Bush said:
``You've caught me. I don't know if I'll watch it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   SO MUCH FOR THE BOUNCE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has canceled out George W. Bush's post-convention bounce
and almost erased his lead in the presidential race, according to a
new Reuters/Zogby poll published today. The poll of 1,005 likely
voters found Bush leading the vice president 43 percent to 40
percent. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader polled 7 percent and Pat
Buchanan of the Reform Party 2 percent. With a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.2 percent, the result was a statistical dead heat.
One week ago, in the aftermath of the Republican National
Convention, Bush led Gore by 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   OF COURSE HE'S NOT BOTHERED
</P>
<P>
   As if he did not have enough problems, embattled Reform Party
faction presidential candidate Pat Buchanan today fou chapter of
the group that once polarized American society with its allegations
of communist infiltration into the highest levels of government.
Its founder had even called President Dwight D. Eisenhower a
conscious agent of the communist conspiracy. Said Buchanan: ``I am
not bothered. My choice of Ezola Foster is as good a thing
politically as anything I have ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   A MILLION-DOLLAR PICK
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin, the other Reform Party nominee, has picked Nat
Goldhaber, a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur, as his running
mate. Goldhaber, who recently sold his direct-marketing Web firm,
Cybergold Inc., said he was unconcerned about the outcome of the
fight within the Party about which faction can rightfully claim the
$12.5 million in federal matching funds. ``$12.5 million will not
make or break the Reform Party,'' he said. Goldhaber declined to
disclose his net worth other than to say party founder Ross Perot
has just ``a wee bit more than I do.'' He added that his attorneys
were trying to determine how much of his wealth he can spend on the
campaign. He reportedly sold his company for $142 million.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S NOT INFLUENCE PEDDLING; IT'S GOODWILL SOWING ...
</P>
<P>
   Oil, gas and mining interests are throwing a blues bash for Rep.
John Dingell. Heavy-hitters Texaco and Bristol-Myers Squibb are
among 24 companies picking up the tab for an extravagant Mardi
Gras-like celebration for Louisiana Sen. John Breaux. And insurance
giant Transamerica is opening its corporate suite for Rep. Charles
Rangel. These events go far beyond typical convention-week soirees
-- each is aimed at the Democrat who would take over a key
committee if the party manages to regain control of Congress in the
November elections, and each is underwritten by special interests
whose business is affected by those committees. Said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics
: ``If the Democrats retake control of Congress, then everyone will
be their friend. But being their friend before they take control
probably wins you a special place in their heart.'' But the chief
of staff for Rangel (D-N.Y.) who stands to take control of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said the lawmaker is being honored
``because of the leadership he provides in the Congress,'' not
because he is in line to take over a top committee.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT LIBERAL BIAS?
</P>
<P>
   Television networks have given George W. Bush more favorable
coverage than Al Gore, both during the GOP convention and
throughout the presidential race, a new analysis finds. The study,
released today by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, examined
72 stories that aired during the Republican National Convention on
the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news. It found that 60 percent of
people quoted in stories praised Bush's policies, political skills
or personal character, while 80 percent of people quoted criticized
Gore. The study also looked at coverage during the primaries, and
found 53 percent of the comments about Bush positive, compared with
40 percent of comments about Gore. This is the inverse of 1992 and
1996, when President Clinton received much more positive coverage
than his opponents, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S NOT A CONVENTION WITHOUT THE KENNEDYS
</P>
<P>
   Democrats could convene in Los Angeles without Kennedys, but it
would not seem right. Democrats have celebrated Kennedy triumphs
and grieved over Kennedy tragedies _ and pained over Kennedy
misadventures _ at every convention since then. Now, 10 conventions
after John F. Kennedy's triumph in Los Angeles, the torch passes to
his determinedly private and non-political Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, a lawyer and co-author of books on privacy and the
Bill of Rights. She will be given eight prime-time minutes Tuesday
night to speak and introduce her uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who
will also speak. Other Kennedys have been given brief roles in the
convention's daytime sessions. Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), son
of Edward, had a moment in today's opening session. Maryland Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Townsend Kennedy, daughter of Ethel and Robert
Kennedy, also is down for a moment _- less than a minute -- Tueaday
afternoon. And Robert Kennedy Jr. speaks tomorrow afternoon about
his heartfelt interest, the environment.
</P>
<P>
   NOT THE SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE
</P>
<P>
   Gary Smith, who has served as the executive producer for the
Democratic conventions since 1988, has identified the basic problem
wih the event this year: ``You're taking four days to do what could
be done in one.'' He's doing what he can to put some life in the
party: tonight's finale, following President Clinton's speech, will
be `76 Trombones,' performed by the cast of Broadway's revival of
`The Music Man.' Smith is also gleeful over locating a 1928
recording of Al Gore Sr. playing the fiddle, which will be heard
Thursday when the younger Gore accepts the presidential nomination.
But he has made a rather risky decision: to play ``Mambo No. 5'' --
a song about womanizing -- in the convention hall to keep up
delegates' enthusiasm between speeches. Since one of the lines in
the song is `A little bit of Monica' -- obviously something the
Democrats don't want to use -- the lyrics have been rewritten with
names of states instead of names of women.
</P>
<P>
   A DELEGATE SITUATION
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Alaska delegates are planning to withhold their
support for Al Gore until he listens to their concerns about the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Alaska Democratic Party
endorses responsible development of the vast oil reserves in the
region, but the National Democratic platform opposes any drilling.
Because Alaska's electoral votes seem solidly in the GOP column,
the faction sees a threat to deny Gore a unanimous nomination as
the only way to get his attention. Said Alaska AFL-CIO head Mano
Frey: ``I don't expect to change his mind as far as (the wildlife
refuge), but he needs to know the importance of what that means.''
The Gore campaign said it was unaware of Frey's plan.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY MICE MEET CITY MICE
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee delegates have been told not to wear any ``Road Kill''
T-shirts at this week's convention. The instructions illustrates
the delicate balancing act they face this week: how to testify
about Gore's small-town and rural roots without making the state
look backwoods. ``They told us we're going to be on national TV, so
we need to show Tennessee pride and respect,'' said Nashville
attorney Mario Ramos. The ``road kill'' advice refers to a
Tennessee law that allows residents to ``salvage road kill for home
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   LOVING THE MONEY BUT HATING THE BUNNY
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats praised Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) for
moving her Hispanic Unity fund-raiser, and Playboy founder Hugh
Hefner called the uproar ``ludicrous and hypocritical,'' the New
York Times reports today that in the last decade, Hefner and
daughter, Christie Hefner, Playboy's CEO, have given about $95,000
to Democratic candidates and committees, with at least $8,000 going
to the Clinton and Gore campaigns. The contributions reflect the
Hefners' socially liberal ideology, with a large amount going to
Democratic women, including Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign.
Incidentally, the event has been moved to B.B. King' Universal
Studios' CityWalk, even though King himself is a GOPer who backs
George W. Bush. And this morning, Sanchez withdrew herself as a
convention speaker because she said the publicity generated was
taking away from ``what we really have to do here at the
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   DAUGHTERS OUT FRONT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's daughters, Karenna Gore Schiff and Kristin Gore, will
serve as their family's chief ambassadors until he and and wife
Tipper arrive at the convention lateke her political debut when she
introduces Tipper on Thursday night. Karenna said she hasn't ruled
out a possible run for office in the future. ``I look forward to
when I have more people in my generation running, but I don't think
we should all come from the same family, so Kristin and I are
campaigning for some fresh blood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY, TAKE THREE
</P>
<P>
   Citing people who have worked with ex-Sen. Bill Bradley, the
Trenton Times reports that the one-time Democratic presidential
candidate said he knows his speech at the convention Tuesday has to
be a good one, as he is acutely aware that he can ill afford a
third prime time disaster in the spotlight of a national
convention. Bradley is haunted by dismal performances at two
previous national conventions, and the immediate goal of his speech
is to win favorable comparisons to the one Sen. John McCain
delivered two weeks ago in support of George W. Bush.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In this not-quite-centennial year of Louis
Armstrong, there may not be a better way to see this city than
through the eyes of his latest and perhaps most obsessive
biographer, Tad Jones, a 48-year-old music writer and
fifth-generation New Orleanian. It is a ghostly business, conjuring
a legendary life and vanished landmarks from yellowed archives,
shuttered ruins and renamed streets, but a labor of love for Jones,
who is deep into the most exhaustive excavation yet of Armstrong's
hometown roots and the influences that made him, in the reverent
words of Bing Crosby, ``the beginning and the end of music in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dozen years of research and writing so far _ with no
publication date set _ Jones, co-author of an earlier study of New
Orleans music, has dug deep into local property archives to trace
Armstrong's slave ancestry back to 1818. He has haunted Armstrong's
streets, where music once spilled from every saloon, where young
Louis once dipped his face in flour and won an amateur contest in
whiteface, and where he worked for the Karnofsky family, who gave
the future trumpeter his first gig tooting a tin horn on their junk
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for any commemorative plaques. There are none to
mark these and other landmarks, a lapse that Jones is trying to
remedy with appeals to various officials. Indeed in many cases
there is no place to hang a plaque: The sites have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's very birth was long shrouded in myth, one fostered
by Satchmo himself: that he was born on July 4, 1900. But in a
baptismal registry Jones found proof that Armstrong was born on the
more prosaic Aug. 4, 1901, which has stretched out the centennial
commemorations being held from here to Corona, Queens, where
Armstrong died at home in 1971 when he was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Just blocks from where young Louis grew up here, in a long since
demolished row of red brick rooming houses near today's Loyola
Avenue and Perdido Street, Jones pointed out a boxy green glass
office building at 234 Loyola. On this site in the 1870s, Jones
said, his own great-grandfather Jacinto Buno ran a saloon and
restaurant. In 1907 his family sold the property to the Colored
Knights of Pythias, which put up a 13-story headquarters with
offices, theater, dance hall, movie house and roof garden. It was
the first such elaborate black enterprise in the South, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it captivated young Louis: ``He's 7 years old, waiting
to go up,'' Jones said, savoring the imagined scene. In 1913, at
age 11, he was remanded to the Colored Waifs' Home for Boys for
firing a blank pistol and disturbing the peace. But before his
release a year and a half later, Armstrong returned to the Pythias
hall as a member of the orphans' orchestra to play a concert. Years
later, as an accomplished jazzman in 1921, Armstrong was playing
the hall's roof garden.
</P>
<P>
   One block away toward the Mississippi River, South Rampart
Street bears its own Armstrong imprints. It is a street still lined
with the frames of old pawnshops and secondhand stores where blacks
barred from white Canal Street shopped in Jewish markets and drank
in Sicilian bars. Today its parking lots are ghostly markers of the
Armstrong legend _ one was once home to the Astoria Hotel, others
to the Pelican Saloon and other honky-tonks where Armstrong and Kid
Ory on trombone and Joe Oliver on trumpet played.
</P>
<P>
   It was the melange of musical and cultural influences that
fostered Armstrong's humanitarianism, Jones suggested. For all the
deprivation, poverty and discrimination he endured, Armstrong
somehow emerged with singular ebullience, although among friends he
could be caustic about the evils of segregationist America.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the confluence of all this music, he was taking his
genius and synthesizing it, from blues to gospel, ragtime and
opera,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out the easy-to-miss shuttered wood and red brick
shell on South Rampart Street, all that remains of the Iroquois
Theater, built in 1912. In his memoirs Armstrong told of watching
movies there for a nickel and of his triumph in the amateur contest
where he performed in whiteface.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down, at 427 South Rampart, Jones stopped at a small
building that once housed the secondhand shop of the Karnofsky
family, peddlers whose welcoming home and payroll sustained young
Louis in hard times. ``You name it, the Karnofskys sold it,'' Jones
said. In 1920 the father, Morris Karnofsky, opened a record shop
where the 19-year-old Armstrong and other black musicians were
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Torn down almost 50 years ago for the City Hall complex were the
nearby row houses where Armstrong and his sister grew up after
their mother, Mayanne, moved the family from squalid Jane Alley in
an outlying slum Armstrong called ``Back o' Town.'' A tree marks
the spot where their house probably stood, Jones said, and a nearby
grassy rise is all that remains of the music mecca called Kenna's
Hall, but that Armstrong and his cronies knew by a cruder nickname.
The building of City Hall also wiped out all traces of the Fisk
School, the local public school for blacks, which Louis barely
attended when he was 6 or 7. ``If he went there for more than two
years, I'd be surprised,'' Jones said. Blacks needed to attend
school only for 120 days a year, he said, whites, 180.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1988, while doing research for Gary Giddens, the jazz
writer, and Toby Byron, a television producer preparing an
Armstrong book and documentary, that Jones began to think that
Armstrong had actually been born a year or two later than he said.
An overlooked clue had come from Armstrong himself. In the 1940s he
told his Belgian biographer, Robert Goffin, that he was baptized at
the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church. The church, on Lopez Street, was
for whites, but urged on by Giddens, Jones discovered that black
infants, including Armstrong, had been baptized there as well, and
he came up with the new birth date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the easiest thing I've ever done,'' said Jones, dressed
in jeans, a maroon golf shirt and sneakers, as he strolled through
Armstrongland. ``Do I look like a rocket scientist?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he gave the news to Richard Allen, a former jazz curator
at Tulane University, who passed it on to The New Orleans
Times-Picayune, which sent it out on the Newhouse news service
``That was it, 50 newspapers picked up on it,'' Jones recalled. ``I
was getting phone calls like I had discovered the Holy Grail or the
cure for cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several years later Jones landed a book contract with the
University of Illinois Press. All told, he said, his advance and
grants over his decade of work have barely reached $5,000, although
he and his co-authors, Jason Berry and Jonathan Foose, had written
the well-received ``Up From the Cradle of Jazz: New Orleans Music
Since World War II'' (University of Georgia Press, 1986). A dabbler
on the guitar and piano, although he does not play for a living,
Jones has supported himself working as a paralegal and manager of a
music publishing group owned by the long-running New Orleans-based
rock band the Radiators. (He is also scheduled to lecture on
Armstrong's musical influences in a commemorative series at Lincoln
Center in New York in October.)
</P>
<P>
   Retracing some of his archival research in the conveyance office
in City Hall, Jones pulled out heavy quill-penned books that
summarized hundreds of thousands of property transfers _ including
the sale and purchase of slaves _ from 1827 to 1865. New Orleans
was one of the largest slave markets in the South. ``Once you get
one sale you can track forward or backward,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   So he traced the roots of Armstrong's family tree. The baptismal
certificate with the crucial 1901 date had listed a Catherine
Walker as a co-sponsor of the child. ``I initially thought she was
a white neighbor whom the Armstrongs might have worked for,'' Jones
said. But the summaries in the conveyance office and the original
documents in the city's nearby notarial office told a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   He found the record he was seeking on Page 344 in a thick volume
labeled ``Acts, Jan.-July 1818, Marc Lafitte, Notary.'' On May 18,
1818, a slaveowner named Antoine Turcas purchased Daniel Walker,
32, from Richmond for about $600, a substantial price at the time.
Walker, a further search of the records showed, had a son, also
named Daniel, who married Catherine Washington, born in 1837 and
brought with her mother and sister from a plantation in Madison
County, Miss., to New Orleans, where they were auctioned off
together. Catherine and Daniel Walker had a daughter named
Josephine who later married Ephraim Armstrong. They had a son named
Willie, the father of Louis Armstrong. Catherine Walker, Louis'

   Jones said he knew he was spending a lot of time on local
details but that it was important for the understanding of
Armstrong and the myriad influences, musical and otherwise, that
shaped him. Some of his predecessors may have been in too much of a
hurry, he said, too eager to distance Armstrong from his roots and
catapult him to universal fame. ``They race through New Orleans to
get to Chicago,'' he said.

`BULL': FAST-PACED BUT ROUTINE DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, those wacky rich people and their colorful nicknames. The
hero of the new TNT series ``Bull'' is the grandson of a prospering
investment firm's founder. The grandfather, Robert Roberts, is so
imperious, heartless and soulless he is called the Kaiser behind
his back. The grandson, Robert Roberts III, is nicknamed Ditto.
Even his friends call him that, which seems a misfortune serious
enough to offset all the silver spoons positioned in his mouth at
birth. Ditto is also not a bad word to describe this routine drama.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first of a boomlet of shows and movies set on Wall
Street, tapping into the feeling that everybody's an investor
today. (Fox's fall series ``The Street,'' created by Darren Star of
``Melrose Place'' and ``Sex and the City,'' promises to be
soapier.) But ``Bull'' simply plugs an all-purpose cast of types
into a financial setting. If they were yelling ``Stat! Chem
seven!'' instead of ``Dot-com IPO!'' these people could be in a
hospital show. The bright side: because the financial schemes are
no more than background noise, there's no need to dig into ``Wall
Street for Dummies'' before viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome Ditto (George Newbern) is so sweet, soulful and
independent you have to wonder how he turned up in the cutthroat
Roberts family. In the premiere Tuesday night, he and some friends
leave the old firm to start a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current interest in Wall Street, it's hard to give a
broker the life-saving adventures of a doctor, so ``Bull'' makes
Grandfather Roberts actively evil. The veteran actor Donald Moffatt
makes him smooth, silver-haired and silver-tongued; it is easy to
see why he is so successful a manipulator. But his actions are
those of a mustache-twirling villain.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Malik Yoba (from the police show ``New York
Undercover'') plays Corey Granville, an Ivy League-educated broker
who has just sold $60 million worth of Brazilian bonds the company
has been desperate to unload. The Kaiser insists that because
Granville is black, he would never have made the sale if he had
been negotiating in person instead of on the phone. ``There's a
glass ceiling'' for blacks, he tells Ditto. Grandfather also
orchestrates an illegal trade and gives the credit (and potential
jail time) to Marissa Rufo (Alicia Coppola), a bright young broker
with a working-class background and a family secret. ``How's she
doing?'' she coos into a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Next to all this, Ditto's bolt from the firm seems like an act
of social conscience. Yet when he rallies his friends to join him
he sounds as if they are going off to audition for ``A Chorus
Line.'' Stanley Tucci is also around, wasted as a character whose
villainy is telegraphed with every move but who has been invited to
join the new firm anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull'' does have energy, with a swift style _ noisy,
overlapping conversations and constant motion _ that works well for
a generation that takes MTV and the Internet for granted. But the
half-dozen main characters haven't defined themselves yet, and
there's only a glimmer of hope that ``Bull'' will be given time for
that to happen. Already, the producers of ``Bull'' and ``The
Street'' must be kicking themselves for arriving a season too late.
These shows about the Wall Street boom are turning up after
technology stocks have tumbled and investors have become jittery.
Ditto is young; there's still time for him to go to law school.  &QL;

 &HT;    3 days aboard a submarine, a weapon of unimaginable power
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - From the bottom of the ladder, looking
up, way up, the circle of sky beyond the open hatch looks pretty
small. Very small. Far away, and very small.
</P>
<P>
   Then a sailor pulls down on the hatch and dogs it tight with
metallic finality, and a few drops of water jump from the hatch,
fall past the steel ladders and twisting cables and splat onto the
deck, where they glisten in the dim red light of the control room,
stowaways entirely out of their element.
</P>
<P>
   A voice nearby, a sailor: ``It's quiet, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's quiet on board the USS Hampton. Very quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's even quieter down at 600 feet,'' says the sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, joy.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines, the silent service.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, it was the downright mute service, shrouded
in secrecy as deep as ocean canyons, unfathomable to laymen, even
to most members of Congress, but not always to the Soviets, and
apparently not to Tom Clancy.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 50 years, since Admiral Hyman Rickover first put
nuclear reactors on board, subs have been off limits to the press
and public. What we didn't know about modern subs made them seem
all the more mysterious. Nobody, not even the president, could
contact a nuclear sub when it was out there somewhere, submerged,
armed with enough weaponry to obliterate a civilization. Or two.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Navy celebrates the 100th anniversary of its
submarine forces, it has popped the hatches of these weapons for
closer inspection, rides even, by members of the media who, until
now, had only blacked-out declassified documents, rumor and Tom
Clancy to go on.
</P>
<P>
   The subs are open for inspection, and it's as if the bedroom
light has been flicked on during dreams full of dark images, of
forces beyond comprehension. And do the myths and mysteries
evaporate when a nuclear sub is explored in the clear light of day?
</P>
<P>
   No. They are verified.
</P>
<P>
   Three days on board the Hampton in the North Atlantic about 220
miles east of Norfolk, Va. Conclusion: These boats are weapons of
unimaginable power. Scary. Terrible. Apocalyptic. A force almost
beyond comprehension. And, just maybe, the most significant
deterrent in our national arsenal, the reason no enemy has ever
dared fire a missile our way.
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing: From captain to cook, the entire crew could
be lifted off and sent to work in some start-up company, product
irrelevant. The result would be a company to reckon with. Almost
half of them are nuclear engineers. Many hold advanced degrees in
engineering, business, foreign policy. They're entrusted with
almost $2 billion worth of hardware. They make big decisions on a
minute-to-minute basis. They work independently, yet as one. They
are diligent. They are young.
</P>
<P>
   Their sub is something else, too: a Los Angeles-class fast
attack sub, 330 feet long, 36 feet in diameter and almost
impossible for the enemy to find. It's as big as a World War II
cruiser, but it lives underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Subs have come a long way since John Holland, an Irish patriot
and inventor who lived in New Jersey, sold the Navy its first, the
Holland, commissioned SS-1 on Oct. 12, 1900. It was the sixth sub
Holland had built. He sold the fifth to Irish revolutionaries who
wanted to toss _ or sink _ the British out of Ireland. The Irish
took their boat _ without paying Holland _ but they didn't get far.
The British and U.S. navies scoured the Atlantic for months looking
for the rogue sub, but it had never left America. It was found in a
barn in Lyme, Conn., decades later. How it got there, nobody knows.
In a sense, that's a typical submarine anecdote: A submarine is a
weapon designed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what the Hampton does a few minutes after the
hatch closes. It disappears. That's what makes it so dangerous. It
can simply ... disappear. Well, that and 23 radio-controlled, high
explosive torpedoes and a dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons make the Hampton dangerous, but the crew makes it work.
</P>
<P>
   They're all young. The captain, John Lovering, a Cape Cod
native, is in his early 40s, the oldest guy on the boat, except for
one chief petty officer who's 46. More than 130 men in the crew and
not a one of them remembers where they were when JFK died. Most of
them weren't anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   No women on board. Politics aside, it takes maybe nine seconds
to grasp the obvious: Privacy does not exist, except for the
officers, and then minimally. Crew members live side-by-side for
weeks, months. No exit. Two people cannot pass in a corridor
without touching. Bathrooms are shared. Everything is shared.
</P>
<P>
   Bunks are scattered everywhere _ next to torpedoes, over
computers, under torpedoes. They're stacked four high, maybe a foot
of headroom. The bunks _ called racks _ are shared. One sailor
sleeps, another works, then they switch. It's called hot racking,
because the bunks never cool off.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the reactor. It occupies the rear third of the boat
and is way off limits to outsiders, even to crew members who are
not nuclear-rated by the Navy. When the reactor runs out of fuel in
about 12 years, the Hampton gets junked. The ship will probably be
obsolete before then anyway. It was launched in 1992. It's very
fast, very sneaky. Cost: $1.8 billion, before yearly operating
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The reactor produces steam, which drives the turbines that turn
the propeller _ one propeller, its specific design and material top
secret. The Hampton is, at a certain level, a steamboat, which is
ironic because the first steamboat Robert Fulton built was a
submarine, Nautilus, in 1801. He tried to sell the idea to both
Napoleon and the British, but they thought Fulton's idea was
stupid. So he came home to the U.S. and built a riverboat, the
Clermont.
</P>
<P>
   These are good things for a visitor to ponder, because when the
Hampton's diving alarm sounds _ karoooong, karoooong, just like in
the movies _ and a voice cracks dive, dive, dive over the intercom,
a visitor may ponder that patch of blue sky, which may lead to
unsettling feelings of close confinement and downright panic. So,
you tell yourself, hey, this is a big, safe boat, and you try not
to think of the hatch slamming shut. Which is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The two periscopes in the control room are trained on the stern
of the boat. Slowly, the sea washes over the deck, then covers it,
then sloshes against the periscope lens. Then, the boat slips
gently below periscope depth, 62 feet. Below 100, 150. Air pressure
increases just enough to notice, not because of the immense force
of the sea against the hull, but because the crew pumped air
throughout the boat to see if any valve, anywhere, was not closed
tight. If a valve were leaking, the air pressure would slowly
decrease. It doesn't. 200, 250, 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it to 450,'' commands Lovering.
</P>
<P>
   His orders pass along to the men at the controls _ simple
controls, two small wheels. The sub is easy to steer, very
responsive. The slightest touch on the controls send the boat up at
a steep angle. Or down.
</P>
<P>
   450 feet.
</P>
<P>
   How deep is the ocean here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aboutresso. Brewed by a fine Italian coffee machine. Very
important for crew morale, says Lovering. Unfortunately, 27
visiting midshipmen from various college R.O.T.C. programs had very
quickly broken the machine. The cook unplugged it. The crew was not
happy. The midshipmen kept mostly to themselves after that.
</P>
<P>
   Sonar? You bet. Banks of screens in pitch-black rooms are the
eyes and ears of the boat. Computers enhance the images. And, yes,
the experienced sonar operator can spot a whale at 5 miles or tell
the captain what sort of ship is out there, based on the unique
noise of its propeller.
</P>
<P>
   Food? Excellent and plenty of it. Even though there is no day,
no night under the waves, meals served in the morning tend toward
the breakfast end of the spectrum, those at night toward dinner.
Loads of coffee, fresh fruit, sausages, eggs, cakes, popcorn,
steak, spaghetti, meat balls. As much as you want. The dozen or so
officers dine in their mess, a small room with a big-screen TV that
displays the view from the periscope. The intercom is always tuned
to the control room. A direct telephone line to the control room
plugs into the bulkhead next to the captain's chair. Stewards serve
the officers. Enlisted men dine in their mess, watch first-run
movies there as well. Senior enlisted men _ chief petty officers _
stick mostly to their part of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Toilet seats? Toilets on board have seats, a nice homey gesture.
But. Woe to the sailor who leaves the seat up, not for the usual
reasons of domestic tranquility, but because a falling toilet seat
in a submarine will clang against a steel toilet with a resounding
metallic crash throughout the steel hull that can be heard miles
away by enemy sonar, which could, theoretically, result in the
sub's coming under attack. What a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   In order to assure that all those toilet seats are secured,
along with everything loose on board _ coffee cups, wrenches,
brooms, everything _ Lovering puts Hampton through a series of
steep maneuvers soon after diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angles and dangles we call them,'' says Lovering. ``We'll go
up from 400 feet at a 30-degree angle. Then we'll go down. We'll
turn, sharp turns. We'll twist and turn, and if I hear so much as a
drinking glass slide off a table, someone's gonna hear from me.''
</P>
<P>
   So the sub shoots up. Movable bow and stern planes, like the
flaps on an airplane, set the angle. Steep. And fast, more than 20
mph. So steep you lean forward at an angle that keeps you level
relative to the ocean floor. And although top speed is classified,
Lovering says he usually does this faster, and at steeper angles.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turns the sub. The rudder is big, can push a lot of
water. Very tight turns. Crew members grab steel bars overhead.
Subway straps would come in handy. The sub is cavorting like a sea
lion. It is, essentially, flying underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Lovering explains that these boats are incredibly responsive _
can turn full around within their length. But they were built with
an engineering glitch not discovered until they were put through
their paces. Like an airplane, if you tell a sub to turn and dive
at a fast enough speed, it will tend to roll out of control and
plummet straight toward the bottom. Unlike an airplane, a sub
cannot be allowed to roll over because hundreds of gallons of acid
in the 126 giant batteries (battery power is still used on nuclear
subs, in emergencies mostly) would flood out, creating poisonous
chlorine gas and otherwise wreaking havoc.
</P>
<P>
   This would not be good, deadpans Lovering.
</P>
<P>
   Taped to the control panel is something like a manufacturer's
advisory, step-by-step instructions for ``pulling out'' of such a
dive. Turn the rudder this way, raise this plane, lower that one,
reduce speed. Very reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Lovering snaps his commands. The crew and the boat respond. Up,
down, twist, turn. No cups slide, no wrenches tumble. All is quiet.
There is no hum from the reactor room when power is piled on. No
hum anywhere. No engine vibration. Not even enough to ripple the
surface of a cup of coffee secured in a metal holder. Silence
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Silence is also what you get when you ask a crew member about
top speed, lowest diving depth, torpedo speed and range. The press
packet for the Hampton says top speed is ``in excess of 25 knots,''
about 28 mph. But how much in excess? Hampton's crew members shrug.
Even former attack sub crew members are sketchy, but some will say
top speed is closer to 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   That's fast. Very fast.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the three days the Hampton cruises at between 600
and 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And how deep does it dive? ``In excess of 800 feet,'' says the
press packet. But ex-submariners say it's beyond 1,200 feet.
Besides, as one Hampton sailor says, look at the depth gauge.
</P>
<P>
   The depth gauge goes well beyond 1,200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Hampton passes the three days on fire drills,
simulated torpedo shoots, a hunt-and-kill exercise with a U.S.
ballistic missile sub _ a ``boomer'' that Hampton locates in a few
hours and ``kills'' shortly thereafter. Then, more fire drills,
clean the decks, take readings on every piece of equipment on
board. And then do it all again. When the pressure on the
1-inch-thick skin of the boat can be measured in tons per square
foot, one mistake, one broken valve is one too many.
</P>
<P>
   The midshipmen are suited up for a fire drill. The suits and
helmets are bulky and hot. It's hard to see, hard to move, even in
the comfort of white lights and air conditioning. Worst of all, air
is supplied to the suits by connecting an air hose to an overhead
air line. This is how you move toward the fire: Plug in, breathe,
unplug, grope along down the air line, plug in. If there were
really a reactor fire, thick radioactive smoke, melting metal ... ?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the intent is to keep the men busy helping their
shipmates,'' says a chief petty officer. ``But if the reactor went,
if the hull fractured ... we all go. But that sure as hell ain't
gonna happen as long as I'm around.''
</P>
<P>
   It is known on these boats that the chiefs run the boats; the
officers fight the boats in battle. They depend on each other, and
everybody depends on the chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn on the last day, one last exercise, an ``emergency''
surfacing from 450 feet. Air under thousands of pounds pressure is
blasted into the flooded ballast tanks. A whooomp reverberates
through the boat when the air is released. The air pushes water out
of the tanks. Fast. The depth gauge wavers for a few seconds, then
starts upward, faster and faster like an express elevator. In less
than three minutes, the ship bursts up and out of the deep. At that
last second, everybody on board goes weightless. You float on
tiptoes just for the briefest and most refreshing of moments.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the hatch up top is swung open. A few drops
of water plop to the deck. And a pale blue eye of sky probes the
dark interior of the boat.
</P>
<P>

COLLECTOR JOINS WATCHDOG PANEL ON ANTIQUITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House touched off a furor in the rarefied world of
archaeology when it announced last week that President Clinton had
appointed Shelby White, a wealthy New York collector of
antiquities, to a seat on the government committee formed to help
combat illicit international trade in such objects.
</P>
<P>
   White is known to many professional archaeologists as the wife
of the financier Leon Levy, who shares her passion for antiquities
and is an avid collector himself.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, owners of one of world's finest private collections
of classical artifacts, have a reputation for generosity in
sponsoring archaeological fieldwork, research and publication. But
as collectors they have frequently stirred anger among
archaeologists. While most collectors are chiefly interested in
owning objects, archaeologists generally focus on the preservation
of archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors and archaeologists are often at odds over the issue
of theft. Archaeologists generally take the position that
collectors encourage illegal traffic by creating a market for
antiquities. But reputable collectors insist that they take pains
to check the provenance of objects they acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who wrote to Clinton on White's behalf were
Katherine Lee Reid, president of the Association of Art Museum
Directors and director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, who called
her ``uniquely qualified''; and Glen W. Bowersock, an
internationally respected professor of ancient history at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, who said she would make
``an admirable representative of the nonprofessional community of
collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   But such sentiments are far from unanimous. ``It's like putting
a fox in charge of the chicken coop,'' Nancy Wilkie, president of
the 11,500-member Archaeological Institute of America, said of the
appointment. ``Shelby White is known to everyone in the archaeology
community as a voracious collector who seems to show no concern for
protecting our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We lobbied against her appointment last June, and we thought
it was dead,'' Wilkie said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Bell, a professor of art history and archaeology at the
University of Virginia who has studied the records of the
collection of White and Levy, asked, ``How can she serve on this
committee when she is opposed to the idea that caused the committee
to be formed?''
</P>
<P>
   White, who adamantly insists that her critics have not been able
to prove that she owns looted art, said that her unsalaried
appointment was consistent with the legislation that created the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original idea was to have a representative body of people
_ scholars, collectors, dealers and lay people _ to reach balanced
decisions that would better aid the president and the secretary of
state as to what can be brought into the country and what can't,''
she said, adding that such decisions should not be left only to
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
the New York Democrat who is White's sponsor for the job, said that
the lobbying effort against her by the Archaeological Institute had
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It prompted 20 to 30 carefully reasoned letters saying that
Shelby White is exactly the sort of person who belongs on the
committee,'' Bullock said. ``The original legislation, which was
drafted by Senator Moynihan, wasn't aimed at creating a panel of
people who agreed about everything. It envisioned passionate
disagreements. That is its strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the letter writers supporting White's appointment,
James Cuno, director of the Harvard Art Museums, acknowledged that
her collecting practices had drawn criticism. But he said that he
regarded White and Levy as ``public collectors who make every
effort to share their collections with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for herself, White said she was eager to serve on the
panel, officially known as the Cultural Property Advisory
Committee, ``to be a voice for the collecting community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had broad experience as a collector and archaeologist,''
she said. ``I'm aware of the various archaeological sites. I go on
digs every summer. I'm involved in publication in the field. I
serve on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and I want to
be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion White and Levy have been hard pressed to defend
their acquisitions. About seven years ago, for example, they bought
a dazzling second-century bronze and silver miniature model of a
leopard, one in a collection of 16 such objects that they own that
are suspected of having been surreptitiously removed from Roman
ruins in Icklingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   After claimants to the property threatened to sue for the
recovery of the items, which were considered to be among the most
important archaeological discoveries in the last 50 years, a
settlement was reached in which White and Levy bequeathed all 16
objects to the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member government committee was established in 1983, in
response to widespread concern about the looting of archaeological
sites in poor countries like Guatemala and Peru. Composed of
scholars, dealers, collectors and representatives of the public,
its mandate is to provide the president with recommendations on
archaeological and ethnographic materials that, if pillaged, would
jeopardize a country's cultural patrimony.
</P>
<P>
   If the president (or in practice, the State Department) is
convinced that such a danger exists, importation of cultural
articles from that country may be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Establishment of the committee _ part of U.S. adherence to a
1970 UNESCO convention _ was stalled in Congress for more than a
decade because of pressure from the Art Dealers Association and
other groups and from legislators like Moynihan, who argued that
the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, as set up in the 1983
implementing bill, was too narrowly based to be workable.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan broke the deadlock with compromise legislation that
included the broadening of the committee's membership, although
many advocates for a more powerful committee maintained that his
solution was unnecessarily weak.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the committee has in recent years successfully
urged the establishment of import restrictions on antiquities from
El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Mali and Canada, and on cultural
property from Cyprus and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of the appointment of White seems unlikely to fade
away soon. Claire Lyons, a former vice president of the
Archaeological Institute of America who specialized in professional
responsibility and ethics, said: ``I'm deeply concerned about this
intended appointment. People who buy art from countries where there
is a serious threat of looting get caught in a conflict of interest
that undermines the faith of the public in the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkie pointed to another example of controversial art in
White's collection. ``She bought the top half of a Heracles statue,
the bottom half of which is in the Anatalya Museum,'' on the
southern coast of Turkey, Wilkie said. ``Everybody knows the two
pieces fit together, and that her half was looted, but she says
there is no proof of that and at the same time has never allowed
plaster casts to be made which would settle the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   White said that she and Levy had long ago given the piece to the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and that she had offered to have
plaster casts of the statue made but that no one was interested.
</P>
<P>
   She added that discovering pieces of antiquities that appear to
have been broken apart and that wound up in separate collections
was quite common. ``But that's no reason to return a piece,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   She said she viewed the criticism of her appointment as part of
a bigger dispute. ``I don't think this is a personal attack because
none of these people have ever met me,'' she said. ``I serve on a
lot of boards like the Met Museum. I think it's a attack on them.''

 &HT;    Vanity Fair's content a formula that works
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Tina Brown tinkers with Talk to find the right mix, Vanity
Fair ($3.95) editors continue to follow a formula that nearly
always works. Two or three celebrity profiles, a true crime story,
a usually insightful column from James Wolcott, a compelling book
excerpt and a finely crafted investigative article.
</P>
<P>
   There's always a certain amount of fluff, such as this month's
cover story on Gwyneth Paltrow and other ``It'' girls, but even
that is done with flair. Paltrow, by the way, confesses that her
split with Brad Pitt left her heartbroken forever. Presumably this
is not the sort of thing on-and-off-again boyfriend Ben Affleck
wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   More serious articles include Nick Tosches' report on his search
for an opium den in Bangkok and Hong Kong; Buzz Bissinger's
portrait of Joe DiMaggio as a flawed, tortured hero; and an excerpt
from a new book by Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan that claims
Richard Nixon prolonged the Vietnam War by scuttling LBJ's 1968
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the campaign: If you're not interested in politics, you can
skip reading the newsweeklies this week. Both Time ($3.50) and
Newsweek ($3.50) have nearly mirror image covers of Al Gore and
Joseph Lieberman with similar coverage inside. Both magazines
examine the impact of a Jewish vice presidential candidate and both
rehash Gore's background. Time, however, adds a new twist with a
piece on the women who shaped the vice president. U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($3.50) devotes fewer pages to the campaign but adds a
historical perspective with an article about the first Democrats.
The magazine also notes that Gore's chances for victory depend
heavily on the loyalties of white, married female voters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Games people play: This week's double issue of The New Yorker
($3.95) is all about sports, from Roger Angell's analysis of the
problems of Yankees infielder Chuck Knoblauch and pitcher David
Cone to David Owen's profile of Tiger Woods. One of the most
interesting pieces is Malcolm Gladwell's ``The Art of Failure.''
Gladwell talks to psychologists and other experts about the
difference between ``choking'' and ``panicking.'' Greg Norman
choked at the 1996 Masters, for example, when he dropped 10 strokes
in 10 holes. John F. Kennedy Jr. panicked during his fatal flight.
Choking, Gladwell writes, ``is about thinking too much. Panic is
about thinking too little.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coming soon to a theater near you: Yes, that scruffy, bearded
fellow on the cover of the Aug. 18 Entertainment Weekly ($3.50) is
Tom Hanks as the star of the December film ``Castaway.'' Talk about
great timing. When Hanks and screenwriter William Broyles came up
with the idea six years ago, ``Survivor'' was not even a gleam in
CBS' eye. In its fall guide to the movies, EW speculates on what
will be a box office hit and what will be a miss. Possible hits
include ``Play It Forward'' with Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt;
``Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2''; ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' with Jim Carrey; and ``The Legend of Bagger Vance''
with Matt Damon and Will Smith.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    With its bounty of fresh produce, summer's the perfect time to
get your quota of fruits, veggies
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With New Year's Day verve, countless people resolved to eat a
healthy diet: good fats, not bad; fiber, not fluff; five fruits and
vegetables a day.
</P>
<P>
   Those promises are long forgotten by many, and it's back to life
in the fast-food lane. But summer's the perfect time to re-commit _
seasonal produce offers vitality in juicy, fleshy flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables supply nearly all the vitamins and
minerals required for good health. Some contain complex
carbohydrates that furnish energy. Most provide dietary fiber, and
some even offer protein. As a bonus, they contain no cholesterol,
have little or no fat and are low in calories.
</P>
<P>
   A study published this year in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that women who regularly ate fruits and
vegetables along with whole grains were far less likely to die
prematurely from heart disease, cancer and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Along with health benefits comes the simple joy of enjoying the
summer harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the berries, the yellow squash, the field peas, I could
just go on and on,'' said Sonya Jones, owner and chef of Sweet
Auburn Bread Co. in the Sweet Auburn Curb Market. ``I definitely
eat more vegetable plates during this time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought means the harvest is a little short for some summer
favorites, such as tomatoes and squash, said Ann Brewer, manager of
Georgia Grown: Certified Organic Produce and organizer of the
Morningside Farmers Market. ``But the outlook is good for all the
wonderful greens, all the chards and arugula,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 summer treats worth a stop at the gardener's truck
or a cruise through the organic market or produce section at the
grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Berries
</P>
<P>
   Pretty, small and juicy, berries have a lot going for them,
especially when eaten fresh and unadorned. Many are a good source
of vitamin C, potassium and fiber. Blackberries, strawberries and
blueberries are most popular in this region.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries have the most vitamin C _ 3 1/2 ounces (about 2/3
cup) contains 95 percent of the recommended daily allowance (RDA)
for adults. ``I love to have just a bowl of mixed fresh berries,''
said Jones. ``You don't need to do anything to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantaloupe
</P>
<P>
   Summer melons are refreshing, but some favorites, like
watermelon, don't have a whole lot to offer in nutrients. But a
2/3-cup serving of cubed cantaloupe provides 70 percent of the RDA
for vitamin C for men and women, and 64 percent of vitamin A for
men, 81 percent for women. The orange color comes from
cancer-battler beta carotene.
</P>
<P>
   Corn
</P>
<P>
   Corn is not necessarily a nutritional powerhouse, though it's
fairly well rounded. Just a 1/3 cup of kernels provides 10 percent
to 20 percent of the RDA of vitamin C, folic acid and important
minerals like magnesium, phosphorus and thiamin.
</P>
<P>
   Corn is high in protein, but lacks some important amino acids.
To compensate, combine with beans or meat. Similarly, to help
release the niacin in corn, combine it with an alkaline substance,
such as lime juice. Try a lime-splashed corn salsa with a grilled
chicken breast for a well-rounded meal.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic
</P>
<P>
   The health claims of garlic are numerous, and many are
unsubstantiated. Garlic does contain a substance that interferes
with the formation of blood clots and may also have some
cancer-fighting agents. But it's unclear if cooked garlic looses
some of its punch.
</P>
<P>
   People would have consume very large amounts of garlic to get
its full effect. For instance, men who could stomach 33 cloves at a
time would get 60 percent of their RDA of B6; women, 75 percent.
(B6 helps maintain brain functions and the formation of red blood
cells.) But three cloves offers a smidgen of nutrients and loads of
flavor, especially when combined with other summer favorites like
squash and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Okra
</P>
<P>
   Our good Southern okra is high in fiber and packed with folacin.
One cup sliced provides 44 percent of the RDA of folic acid for
men; 49 percent for women. It's also a good source of vitamin C, B
vitamins, magnesium, potassium and calcium. All of that for a mere
38 calories. That is if it hasn't been drenched in cornmeal and
fried. Try cooking it quickly, preserving some of its natural
crispness, then combining with chopped tomatoes and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a source of vitamin C? Try peppers, which ounce for
ounce have more vitamin C than citrus fruit. Green peppers have
twice as much; red peppers three times as much. Hot peppers contain
357 percent more vitamin C than an orange. A 1/2 cup of chopped
sweet red pepper delivers 158 percent of the daily need for vitamin
C.
</P>
<P>
   Red peppers are packed with beta carotene, too. A sweet red
pepper provides nearly 11 times as much beta carotene as a sweet
green one; hot red peppers 14 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Salad greens/arugula
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, the darker the leaf, the more nutritious the
salad green. Romaine and loose-leaf lettuces have up to six times
as much vitamin C and five to 10 times as much beta carotene as
iceberg lettuce. Greens like arugula and dandelion offer even more.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 3 1/2 ounces of raw arugula has 91 milligrams of
vitamin C compared to 4 in iceberg; and it offers a whopping 309
milligrams of calcium (about 25 percent RDA) compared to 68 in
romaine. It's also a cruciferous vegetable, which means it may help
to protect against cancer. Arugula has a peppery taste and is most
often mixed with other salad greens. Try tossing torn strips of
arugula with pasta, olive oil and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Shell beans/field peas
</P>
<P>
   ``Butter beans and lady peas are my favorites in the
summertime,'' declares Watershed chef Scott Peacock. ``I love the
way they look, the way they taste, everything about them.'' Shell
beans like butter (also called Fordhooks), lima and cranberry are
loaded with protein, fiber and iron. Southern field peas such as
purple hull and lady are close cousins nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the shell beans, limas are the best, but can be hard to
find fresh. A 3 1/2 ounce serving of lima beans delivers 38 percent
of the RDA of vitamin C. Boil or steam beans until tender, season
and enjoy. Crisp-tender beans are also a delightful addition to
green salads or mix them with corn to make succotash.
</P>
<P>
   Summer squash
</P>
<P>
   The best thing summer squashes have going for them is they are a
guilt-free pleasure, with only 19 calories per cup. That is, if you
prepare them in a healthy manner, say steamed or stewed with onions
and herbs. Battered and fried, zucchini sticks can have 210
calories for a 3 1/2-ounce serving, 47 percent from fat. Most
squash offer vitamin C and folacin; patty pan squash (pictured)
provides double the amount of vitamin C as other summer squashes.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Though not as high in nutrients as some other vegetables,
tomatoes are the leading vegetable source of vitamin C in the
American diet because of the quantities we eat. They also provide
beta carotene and lycopene, both believed to help reduce the
chances of certain cancers. And this is one case where processing
can concentrate rather than dilute nutrients. So tomato juices,
sauces and even ketchup carry vitamin C, A and E. But with fresh
tomatoes in season ``just slice them and eat,'' said Brewer of
Georgia Grown: Certified Organic Produce.

A JEWISH MUSEUM STRUGGLES TO BE BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The idea seemed simple, pleasing in its balance: Bring
the German capital back to Berlin 55 years after the fall of
Hitler's Reich and mark that return with several major cultural
projects commemorating, in different ways, the Holocaust and
Germany's lost Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But almost a year after the government returned, those projects
are plagued by delays and confusion. Sitting in a sweltering office
in Berlin's still-unopened Jewish Museum, Ken Gorbey, a New
Zealander recently appointed its project director, posed just one
of the central questions: ``Why on earth should a Kiwi gentile be
here?''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only person pondering that conundrum. Eleven years
after its design was approved, three years after Daniel
Liebeskind's building was completed, more than a year after the
public was allowed a peek into its vertiginous space, one of the
emblematic projects of the new Berlin has a new artistic leader
from down under even as it struggles to install an air-conditioning
system that works.
</P>
<P>
   A revised opening date has just been set: Sept. 9, 2001, more
than a year late. And there are rumblings. Of an unhappy
falling-out between Michael Blumenthal, the museum's American chief
executive, and his former deputy, Tom Freudenheim. Of soaring
costs. Of growing unease over Berlin's many Jewish projects. Of a
``Disneyland aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, the so-called triangle of major new Jewish
projects planned to coincide with the German capital's return to
Berlin form a bizarre picture: a building without an exhibition
(the Jewish Museum), an exhibition without a building (the
Topography of Terror site at the former SS headquarters) and an
embarrassingly vacant central lot (the numbingly debated Holocaust
Memorial).
</P>
<P>
   In theory, they form a whole: The museum commemorates Jewish
life in Germany; the Topography of Terror focuses on the Nazi
perpetrators; and the Holocaust Memorial recalls the 6 million Jews
murdered by the Nazis. But while the theory is tidy, the reality is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Big issues are at stake: how Germany should recall the cataclysm
of the Third Reich, whether the projects are for Germans or for
Jews or both, and whether the uneasy relationship between Germans
and Jews, both marked forever by the death camps, can remain calm
even as Holocaust fatigue grows in this country. Irritation is
evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish Museum building is interesting, but to me it's a
Holocaust sculpture, not a museum,'' said Julius Schoeps, the
director of the Moses Mendelssohn Center, a Jewish research
foundation, and a prominent member of the Berlin Jewish community.
``And now there is an attempt to adorn it in a very American way,
to make a museum of experiences with what I have called a
Disneyland aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the newspaper Die Welt in which he
first invoked Disneyland, Schoeps also took a swipe at Gorbey,
saying that multimedia installations might work in Washington and
``maybe even New Zealand,'' but that Europeans wanted to see
original objects.
</P>
<P>
   Having developed Te Papa, New Zealand's enormously successful
national museum in Wellington, Gorbey, 58, took up his new post in
April. He was drawn to Berlin by what he called ``the incredibly
exciting project'' of chronicling the flowering, destruction and
partial rebirth of German Jewish life in a building of great power.
</P>
<P>
   With its towering empty spaces (what Liebeskind calls voids),
its zigzag form and its angular walls and windows, the building
induces a sense of loss, sometimes even panic. It has been widely
acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been aesthetic concerns _ will the building
overwhelm any exhibition it houses? _ and practical problems, not
least the discovery last year that the air-conditioning system was
inadequate, toilets too scarce and the layout of the entrance
liable to create what Blumenthal called ``a traffic jam of major
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems are linked partly to the very popularity of
Liebeskind's building, which suggests that crowds will be greater
than originally predicted, and to the haphazard way the museum has
evolved from a mere adjunct to the Berlin City Museum into a
full-fledged national institution. Still, the result was more
outlays _ $5 million on top of the $60 million already spent _ and
more delays.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Gorbey, speaking no German and with no particular
knowledge of German or Jewish history. Are these handicaps? ``At
times, but perhaps a certain neutrality is a bonus,'' he said. ``I
am in the museum industry. This building is a massive capital
project, and part of my task is to spend large sums prudently.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gorbey is here to get things done, and there is
a lot to be done after a period of turmoil. Shaike Weinberg, a
former director of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, who
had been working closely with Blumenthal, died early this year;
Freudenheim quit in frustration this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The institution, not a Holocaust Museum despite its appearance,
is to tell the entire 2,000-year history of Jewish life in Germany.
It will deploy what the museum's latest manifesto calls ``objects
in cases, supported by texts and graphics.'' But it will also
engage ``customers'' with ``other experiences provided by object
theaters, computer interactives and opportunities for hands-on
engagement with subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbey explained his plans. ``Look,'' he said. ``We're not going
to have people saying, `Let's go and have fun at the Jewish
Museum.' No, we will be fronting up to the Holocaust, and so the
emotive side will be a little more harrowing. But we hope we will
give a balanced view, showing the joy in the Jewish community at
times and its sense of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Schoeps' criticism is a little shallow,'' he continued. ``This
museum will be based on scholarship, not whimsy. But we want to
appeal to a broad range of people and help them come to terms with
history. So we will animate things, bring people and objects to
life. If Schoeps thinks that's Disney, he needs to visit a standard
object theater in any museum.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By ``object theater,'' Gorbey means the animation of objects
through sound, movies, robotics, lighting and other means to add
drama and perhaps a message to what is known in the trade as ``the
museum experience.'' Wuerth &AMP; Winderoll, a German company based in
Bavaria, has been contracted to work on the design of the exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   As a possible example of animation, Gorbey cited the
correspondence between two 20th-century German Jewish scientists,
Albert Einstein and Fritz Haber.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein came to scorn Germany _ ``a country of mass murderers''
was his lapidary assessment _ but Haber retained some attachment to
a nation he once described as ``bourgeois to its very depths.''
Gorbey said he found the discussion deeply revealing and could
imagine ``doing it in a coffee shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a 74-year-old former secretary of the Treasury who
was born in Berlin and whose family fled Hitler, said: ``This is
not going to be a museum for intellectuals, and so the intellectual
snobs don't like it. We hope children will have fun, or at least
not be bored. But this will be a serious, talked-about place.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a tough manager, has proved extremely adept at
cutting through layers of bureaucracy to obtain funds from the city
of Berlin and the nation. This drive has culminated with the
federal government's taking over the museum from a hugely indebted
city and promising to provide most of an annual budget of about $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   It was for a similar efficiency that Blumenthal said he chose
Gorbey. ``Our new deadline is going to stretch all of us very
far,'' he explained. ``And what I needed was someone very, very
good at knowing what it takes to open a museum. He's the best
museum manager in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   Freudenheim, another old museum hand and an American who worked
for many years at the Smithsonian Institution, departed a few weeks
ago after several disagreements with Blumenthal. ``It's the first
time in my life that I've not been respected for doing professional
things, and I'm very sad about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The men clashed over several matters, including whether, as
Freudenheim urged, the museum should have opened much sooner with a
partial exhibit, whether a recent show on Berlin Jews at the Jewish
Museum in New York should have been brought to the museum and
whether the empty building could have been used for theatrical and
musical productions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, it seems, was that Blumenthal came to see
Freudenhem as a gifted networker rather than a talented manager,
while Freudenheim came to view his boss as a martinet. The friction
between the two American directors was hardly fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's turbulent history has been matched by difficulties
with the other two memorial projects. The Topography of Terror has
not evolved beyond a temporary exhibit of photographs. Abutting a
solitary remnant of the Berlin Wall, the display chronicles the
suffering of people tortured and killed by the SS and the Gestapo.
Construction at this site of a building by the Swiss architect
Peter Zumthor, whose plans were approved in 1993, has not even
begun.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the Berlin administration has balked at the
cost, now estimated at $35 million. ``We were supposed to get a
final report from the city building commission in July, but that
has been delayed to September,'' said Reinhard Ruerup, the academic
director of the Topography of Terror project. ``The fact is, the
mayor is not very enthusiastic, but I do not think he will stop it
in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, is well known for his reservations
about both The Topography of Terror and the Holocaust Memorial. But
Ruerup argued that the new German capital could not do without a
museum ``located at the spot where the central agencies of terror
worked and focusing on the perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   But does Germany want more reminders? Notably, the country has
deferred to foreigners in the conception of all three projects: an
American architect and chief executive for the museum, a Swiss
architect for the Topography of Terror and a New York architect,
Peter Eisenman, for the Holocaust Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish-German question is so delicate and hot that any
person who takes on these projects is going to be burned in some
way, but perhaps more so a German,'' said Wenzel Jacob, the
director of the Federal Museum of Art in Bonn. ``Guilt complicates
everything, which is a pity because a lot of Germans are capable of
doing these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The most treacherous job of all may be the Holocaust Memorial, a
prominent field of columns adjacent to the Brandenburg Gate that
could easily become a target for resurgent right-wing groups.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of discussion, the final touches to the design
are still under review. A planned archive or research center that
was to have been above ground has been moved underground, where
Joseph Goebbels' former bunker complicates the design. Construction
will begin next year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the Germans a lot of credit for doing all
this,'' Blumenthal said. ``But in the minds of many of them, there
is the notion that they are doing it for the Jews, not for
themselves. And so sometimes they feel we are asking for too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by tying together Jewish and German life over many
centuries, and by evoking what Germany lost of itself in the
Holocaust, the Jewish Museum may finally have its greatest impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This museum will also be about what is missing,'' Gorbey said.
``A pocket handkerchief can tell the story of a whole family.''

DON'T EXPECT RUCKUS OVER TEXAS EXECUTIONS 
 
BY CRAGG HINES
</HEADLINE>
 HOUCHRON-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
COMMENTARY _ (``k'' ) category c. Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic Party has leased _ if not sold _
its soul over the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty or 30 years ago, if the Republican presidential nominee
had allowed the execution of an arguably retarded man, as occurred
in Texas last Wednesday, I hope I'm not fooling myself to think
there would have been a protest at a Democratic National Convention
the following week.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect a ruckus over Texas' take-a-number death
chamber (last Wednesday was a double-execution day in Huntsville)
from Democrats in the City of Angels. It's not in the script handed
down by Al Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades, the death penalty has become the
third rail for many Democrats. Opposition to capital punishment
made them look weak on law-and-order. It cost them elections. So
they decided they weren't quite so opposed after all.
</P>
<P>
   It was heartening to see the brief outcry from some Democrats in
June as Texas executed Gary Graham. Unfortunately, the alarm was
sounded by some, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who could barely
find their voice when Democrat Bill Clinton left the campaign trail
in 1992 to sign an Arkansas death warrant. The convict was so
retarded he left the pecan pie from his last meal to eat later.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore supports the death penalty, but even he squirmed when
faced with pleas for a national moratorium on the death penalty.
That movement arose after new evidence showed more than a dozen
death row inmates in Illinois were, in fact, innocent and Gov.
George Ryan, a Republican, called a temporary halt to executions.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Gore now supports a constitutional amendment
to establish victims' rights, a medieval flourish on the popular
law-and-order theme.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Graham, as are most death row inmates
proclaiming their innocence, was a nasty piece of work. If their
convictions are upheld, they should be locked up forever. Period.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Convention's silence aside, the death penalty is
never far from the center of a political discussion in their host
state. California is where the Democratic turn-around picked up
steam.
</P>
<P>
   Top California Democrats had a history of strong opposition to
the death penalty, led by Govs. Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown (1959-1967)
and Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr. (1975-1983).
</P>
<P>
   But in 1986, the younger Brown's appointed state supreme court
chief justice, Rose Bird, was ousted by voters, in large part
because she had never voted to uphold a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The message was obvious. At the 1990 Democratic State
Convention, gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein (now a U.S.
senator) purposefully showcased her support for the death penalty
in a speech that was loudly booed by delegates. Feinstein won the
nomination, but lost to a bigger law-and-order candidate,
Republican Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wilson's Democratic opponent was Kathleen Brown,
daughter and sister of the earlier Democratic governors. She said
that even though opposed to the death penalty on moral grounds, she
would carry out the law. That didn't wash, and she lost.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Democrat Gray Davis (who had been the younger
Brown's chief of staff and whose marriage ceremony was performed by
Rose Bird) made support for the death penalty central to his
gubernatorial campaign. He won big. Now Davis' prospective judicial
appointees are quizzed closely about their views on the death
penalty, and the governor (honorary chairman of the party's
national convention) has made clear that he expects his judges to
resign if they change their mind on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps delegates will sleep better knowing the party is in such
determined hands.

were trapped at the bottom of the sea above the Arctic Circle with
little hope of rescue after their nuclear submarine was seriously
damaged in a collision, the commander of Russia's navy said. The
navy said it had begun a rescue effort in the Barents Sea on
Monday. In the early hours of Tuesday the navy was using small subs
to both inspect the damaged vessel and try to replenish the crew's
oxygen. Rescuers planned to attempt to evacuate the crew sometime
Tuesday, an effort that is expected to be complicated by the
extreme pressure that exists at the depth where the sub is lodged,
approximately 480 feet below the ocean surface. By Sabrina

seems to take place on two planes. In the political arena, the
country's governing alliance wages war on the rebels, while trying
to find a negotiated solution to the conflict that has taken more
than 60,000 lives. But beneath this discouraging, but still
potentially hopeful, process lies a deep public cynicism with
politics itself and a feeling that the war is no longer a conflict
between the Sinhalese and the Tamils that can be peaceably settled.

was upheld, IRS data released by the Congressional Joint Committee
on Taxation shows. The IRS did fire four of its 16,000 auditors for
improperly threatening to audit a taxpayer. By David Cay Johnston.

SUMMER IS NO LONGER BARGAIN AIR-FARE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Wis., Minn.)  (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans who postponed vacations this summer hoping that
airlines would announce major fare sales have had good reason to be
disappointed: There haven't been any, at least nothing comparable
to those a few years ago. And while most analysts attribute the
paucity of summer discounts to continued high demand for flights,
they note that the carriers' growing sophistication in knowing when
to lower or raise fares on everything from individual flights to
entire routes could spell the end to the periodic fire sales of
years past.
</P>
<P>
   That forecasting ability was made possible by the computer
application called yield management. Because of it, ``the airlines'
skill at filling seats with targeted sales makes it unnecessary to
offer across-the-board fare sales,'' said Terry Trippler, the
air-fares expert at onetravel.com, a Web site for travel bargains.
Besides, he added, Wall Street doesn't like such wholesale
giveaways, which can result in lower revenues and depressed stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing the airline industry's performance in the first
quarter of this year, Raymond Neidl, director of equity research at
Ing Barings, the investment bank, recently observed that ``the
positive thing is that the ticket price increases seem to not have
dampened travel.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also true of the second quarter of this year, as well as
of last month. ``With most airlines reporting a much higher demand
than last year, there is less incentive for the typical summer fare
sales we usually see,'' said Sandra Hughes, vice president for
travel-related services for the AAA.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, leisure air fares _ that is, discount fares that
usually require advance purchases, off-peak flights and a Saturday
night stay-over _ jumped almost 16 percent in June, according to
the AAA monthly leisure travel index. While fares decreased 5
percent last month they were still almost 10 percent higher than in
July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for flights is still so strong, that the three fare
increases this year did little if anything to discourage Americans
from flying. Most airlines carried record numbers of passengers in
recent months, including Delta, which carried a company record 32
million passengers in the three months ended June 30. In June,
Northwest achieved a company record 82.8 percent load factor _ the
percentage of available seats occupied by paying passengers _ and
Continental's 80.4 percent load factor last month was its highest
ever _ 0.4 percent higher than the record set this June and 2.6
points higher than July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, industrywide load factors, which have been in the high
70s most of this year and 80.2 percent in June, may eclipse the
post-World War II record annual load factor of 70.1 percent set
last year. (Between 1942 and 1945, when civilian flights were few,
load factors ranged from 72.7 to 88 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, where arrivals rose each month from February through
May this year and the state appears headed for a record number of
visitors, round-trip air fares have averaged $600 to $700 for
seven-day-advance-purchase tickets between the West Coast and
Honolulu, almost double the $300 to $400 in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually by this time you could figure on at least one or two
fare sales,'' said Kana Leong, the owner of Pacific Island Travel,
an agency that handles both corporate and individual travel, in
Honolulu. ``But we haven't had any sales this year, because the
planes are coming in and going out loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true on the mainland, where flights to popular
tourist destinations are full and fare bargains rare. And even when
there have been sales, they have been limited: on Aug. 1, TWA
announced a sale good for travel through Dec. 15 that included $398
round trips from New York to Los Angeles or San Francisco, but
tickets had to be bought by Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there has been no shortage of other advertised fare
sales this summer _ sales to call attention to new routes or
additional flights on the same route, sales to stimulate traffic on
routes, sales to off-season destinations and sales offering
discounts of up to 10 percent for booking online. But most of these
discounts were modest and followed fare hikes as well as the $30
surtax to cover increased fuel costs. Even heavily advertised
``discounted'' fares on one airline are often 25 percent or more
higher than the regular fare on competing airlines flying the same
route.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled as the airlines are at yield management, they seem to
have had trouble figuring out the seasons this year _ at least
summer, which most of the travel industry, including the nonprofit
Travel Industry Association of America and the AAA, considers to be
June, July, August and possibly the few days until Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while ``summer sales'' to such off-season
destinations as the Caribbean advertised discounts of about 25
percent, most such sales were announced in mid-July and required a
14-day-advance purchase, thus greatly shortening summer. Delta's
``early summer sale'' to certain cities in Asia, Europe and Latin
America was valid for travel only through June 15, meaning it ended
before summer started.
</P>
<P>
   At another extreme, AirTran's mid-July ``Beat the Heat'' fare
sale is good for travel through Dec. 15, because, the airline said,
``our customers don't want summer to end.''
</P>
<P>
   With crowded planes and higher fares it would be easy to
conclude that passengers aren't interested in discounts. But as the
Department of Transportation recently noted, after Sun Country
Airlines started twice-daily discount service between Milwaukee and
Minneapolis-St. Paul a year ago, fares on that route, dominated by
Northwest, fell 55.4 percent (from $240 to $107) while passenger
traffic rose 76.7 percent.

 &HT;    AL GORE'S PROBLEM IS NOT BILL CLINTON
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore's big problem, so the story line went
before his predecessor's speech Monday night, is too much Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his wife, according to the broadband of
preconvention analysis, have been leaching limelight and sucking up
campaign money that might have gone to Gore. The only blessing, it
would seem, is that after Monday night, they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   As often as it has been repeated, there's a great deal wrong
with this logic. At bottom, it's a means of injecting drama into
what amounts to a natural progression: Two-term presidents, by
their nature, cast a shadow, and vice presidents running for
president have to struggle to stand on center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really think of any way for it not to happen that
way,'' observed Education Secretary Richard Riley after speaking to
the Georgia delegation Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very natural when you have a president going out and a
vice president coming in, that you have a period of saying goodbye
to the president, and then of welcoming in the new voice,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were similar stories in 1988, as Vice President
George Bush prepared to take the reins from Ronald Reagan in New
Orleans. The story has longer legs this year, however, because of
the Democrats' perceived desire to distance themselves from the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, and because Gore is farther behind George
W. Bush than Bush's father trailed Michael Dukakis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   With the selection of Sen. Joe Leiberman as his running mate,
Gore clearly has attempted to separate himself from the scandalous
side of Bill Clinton. But Gore's core problem isn't that Clinton
continues to get too much attention, and to believe too literally
in this analysis is to risk throwing the baby out with the bath
water. If Gore does turn this election around, he will owe as much
to Clinton's legacy as the elder Bush did to Reagan's.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of numbers from the latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll
starkly illustrate this point. Sixty-eight percent of those polled
rated Clinton's presidency a success, while 47 percent said there
was no chance they were going to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that only 7 percent thought Gore's association with
Clinton helped him, while 37 percent thought it hurt. But what that
really means is that when you add up all the people who care either
way about Gore's association with Clinton, it's still a smaller
percentage than those who are sure they aren't voting for him.
</P>
<P>
   What these numbers suggest is that Gore's real problem is his
personal favorability. That may be due in part to the familiarity _
and inevitably, fatigue _ that has grown around him over the past
eight years, while Bush remains relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But his difficulties in getting the public to warm up to his
candidacy are not unlike those he had when he ran for president in
1988, when Clinton was still governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for all his faults, is the first Democrat since
Franklin Roosevelt to be elected president twice. His legacy is
infernally complicated, and his personal weaknesses have been a
matter of national obsession for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, he is not Al Gore's problem.

THE ACCIDENTAL PILGRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20) 
 By RAY CORMIER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until I went to Rome this summer, the word pilgrim usually
conjured up images of the dour early arrivals on American shores. I
certainly couldn't conceive of myself as a pilgrim, the kind who
makes a journey to a holy place for religious purposes. I'm a
lifelong Catholic, but I don't have the kind of faith that I
associate with people who go to great lengths to visit the four
major basilicas of Rome for Holy Year indulgences.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rome overflows with both the sacred and the profane, and
there are plenty of reasons to visit the city. And so when my wife,
Eileen, had an opportunity to take a graduate education course at
the Jesuit Curia, the order's headquarters, a block from St.
Peter's Square, we jumped at the chance to finally visit Rome. We
decided to ignore the warnings about how crowded the city would be
for this Roman Catholic Jubilee year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, we more than mingled with those crowds of
special visitors: the trip, organized by Fordham University mainly
for teachers and administrators in Catholic schools, included tours
to all the big basilicas and a papal Mass. Not only would I get a
first-hand look at all those pilgrims but I would also become one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The experience began with our accommodations. An 18-room guest
house, the Fraterna Domus, is run by sisters of the Volunteers of
Christian Social Service. It was spotless, quiet and spartan. Our
small, L-shaped, marble-tiled room had three twin beds (the alcove
with the third bed actually gave us more room than most of the
other guests had), a desk, a small, low table and a closet. Our
compact private bathroom somehow included a sink, a toilet, a bidet
and a shower _ but no shower curtain.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The price was right, though _ $45 apiece a night, including a
minimal breakfast. Do pilgrims need television or wake-up calls? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While friendly and helpful, the sisters were serious about the
11 p.m. curfew. When they gave the key to our group's leader, Dr.
Gerald Cattaro, so some of our companions could try to find some
night life, two who returned separately (in fact, earlier than the
others) knew they had received a scolding from the sister who let
them in, even without understanding a word of Italian.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Fraterna, though, is just a five-minute walk to the
spellbinding Piazza Navona (plenty of nightly entertainment, and
free), and about 10 minutes to the Spanish Steps, the Piazza del
Popolo, the Pantheon and Castel Sant'Angelo. So the secular tourist
in me would have been satisfied even without the group bus tours to
other classic sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Sistine
Chapel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Cattaro kept saying, we were on a pilgrimage, and the
program quickly made us feel it. On guided tours, we eventually
passed through all four Holy Doors, at the basilicas of St.
Peter's, St. Mary Major, St. John Lateran and St. Paul's Outside
the Walls. Cardinal Giovanni Cheli, a friend of Cattaro's who is a
former representative of the Vatican to the United Nations, said
Mass for us at the Basilica of SS. Cosmos and Damian, next to the
Forum. I'd never heard of this church, but it has a colorful mosaic
ceiling so brilliant that it didn't seem possible that it was
almost 1,500 years old.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We also attended a special, intimate Mass in the former living
quarters of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. The 35 in
our group sat and stood in an unadorned whitewashed room with a
timbered ceiling, next to Ignatius' former bedroom, where his desk
and chest of drawers are displayed. It was a casual, warm liturgy,
without pomp. I imagined that it was similar to the gatherings of
the early Christians in the catacombs and the area uncovered in the
fascinating excavations leading to St. Peter's grave under St.
Peter's Basilica (begun in 1939, secretly, out of fear the Nazis
would find out), which we later visited.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At just about every stop, we saw other pilgrims. In fact, a
group had lunch at the Fraterna on our first day _ the sisters
offer one of the best bargains in town: $10 for a home-cooked,
four-course meal, as long as you make reservations before noon and
don't mind a set menu (wine or soft drinks are a little extra). The
diners, Italians but not Romans, wore matching, distinctive
kerchiefs around their necks, like Boy Scouts, and talked and
smiled and laughed nonstop.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we heard groups break into prayer or song, as a cadre
of about 30 did in St. John Lateran. It served to remind me,
surrounded by tourists, that we were in a church, after all, not a
museum.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, however, it was at the evening papal Mass in
St. Peter's Square for the Feast of St. Peter that we were immersed
in pilgrim spirit. The excitement of the crowd, which filled about
three-fourths of the 35,000 seats in the vast space, was almost
frightening. Some had shoved us out of their way to get through the
metal detectors under Bernini's magnificent colonnade in a rush for
the closest seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were so early that we found space in about the 10th row, and
a young American couple sat down next to us. They quickly left,
though, after we told them that Mass was still a couple of hours
away and would probably last that long again.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But their seats were quickly taken and, at one point, the
90-degree heat and crowding had me thinking that perhaps the couple
had made the right decision. But since we were near the front,
shadows from the facade that almost inexplicably hid Michelangelo's
great dome brought us some relief from the blazing sun. That was
around the time the Swiss Guards took up their positions _ they
would not budge for hours _ and formally attired men ushered in
families of the honored guests. These included the church's newest
archbishops, among them New York's Edward M. Egan, who were to
receive their palliums, stoles that signify their ecclesiastical
rank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we waited, the atmosphere was laid back, with people
chattering as they cowered from the sun under umbrellas or stood in
hope of a breeze. Three rows ahead, a man held a radio to his ear
listening to the play by play of the European soccer championships
semifinal between Italy and the Netherlands. Homage was being paid
to both of Italy's national religions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 6:29 it became clear why the crowd was there. The tiny,
hunched-over, red-clad form of John Paul II appeared through the
great door behind the outdoor altar. Applause began, and as the
pope, looking extremely frail, slowly moved toward the altar, the
clapping swept backward in waves across the square.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen archbishops, also in red, huge bunches of red
roses on the steps, and the red-draped altar canopy framed the
pontiff. As we sat for the chanting of the Kyrie (Lord, have
mercy), the people just to our right started waving tiny Polish
flags and red-and-white scarves, trying to get the pope's
attention. Smiling, they half rose in their chairs to see if they
would elicit a glance, a wave, any kind of notice from the altar.
Eileen and I looked at each other, stunned by what seemed behavior
from a football game or concert.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it happened again _ just after the gospel. And again _ after
the archbishops received their palliums. And again _ at the end of
the Mass. The Poles were not alone: a young nun in full habit waved
Peru's flag when the Peruvian archbishop was called up, and the
Croatian archbishop was cheered lustily by a flag-waving group of
about 50 of his compatriots.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And throughout the liturgy, there were muffled sounds of the
soccer match on the radio. Just as Mass ended at sunset, about
8:40, with the pope getting into a jeeplike vehicle to ride among
the crowd that surged to barriers to get close to him, car horns
started blaring in the distance. Italy had won!  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This holy, and worldly, city was ready for another celebration.
</P>

SMALLER CRUISE SHIPS SLIP INTO ALASKA'S NARROW FJORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Also see TRAVEL-ALASKA and TRAVEL-ALASKA-ENVIRON. Second
take is a 300-word information box)  
 (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By JOHN ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard not to be smug when you're on a small-ship cruise of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever my wife, Lisa, and I were not congratulating ourselves
for having chosen our little 84-passenger ship for a journey
through Alaska's Inside Passage last August, somebody else was
doing it for us: the crew, our fellow passengers, even local
residents at the ports of call.
</P>
<P>
   Our boat, the Cruise West Spirit of Discovery, was smaller and
nimbler than the big ships, able to get in and out of narrow
inlets, and at liberty to slow down any time somebody saw a grizzly
bear on shore, or speed up to catch a pod of breaching humpback
whales. It could maneuver through ice floes without disturbing the
seals sleeping on them, and linger at thousand-year-old glaciers.
Unlike some boats, ours had no rigid schedule dictated by the need
to get back into international waters to resume gambling; in fact,
there was no gambling at all.
</P>
<P>
   Never having taken a cruise before, I was concerned that a small
ship would be less stable in choppy waters. I worried that the tiny
cabins and lack of on-board entertainment would drive us stir-crazy
after a few days.
</P>
<P>
   I needn't have worried. Our cabin was small, but cozy. The
simply prepared food _ everything from fresh Alaskan halibut to
barbecued chicken and ribs _ was plentiful. The public spaces,
including a cafeteria-like dining room and a comfortable lounge
with a bar and a shelf of books, were crowded only when rain (or a
brimming platter of snacks) forced everybody indoors. We never
needed our seasickness pills, barely cracked the paperbacks we
brought from home, and rarely tore ourselves from the majesty
outside our window.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's natural beauty is a never-ending spectacle, and our
small ship gave us front-row seats.
</P>
<P>
   We knew we had made the right choice on our arrival in
Ketchikan, where we boarded. At the dock, we were treated to a
side-by-side comparison. To our left stood the 166-foot-long Spirit
of Discovery, no bigger than a Circle Line boat. To our right was a
2,000-passenger megalopolis of the seas. The ship's anchor was
nearly the size of our entire boat. Only after the gargantuan
cruise ship pulled out of port did I realize that its 12 stories
had been blocking out the sun. The four-foot swells created by the
leviathan's wake would be the roughest waters we encountered during
the entire trip.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few days, we nearly forgot about the existence of
the bigger boats as we cruised through inlets too narrow for them
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Our first full day of sightseeing brought us early in the
morning to Misty Fjords National Monument, which was indeed misty.
But by 8 a.m., the fog began to dissipate, unveiling a world of
vibrant evergreens. The steep, forested cliffs on either side of
the fjords presented a landscape like none we had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we cruised through the Wrangell Narrows on our way
to the LeConte Glacier. Lisa and I had tried to see a glacier once
before, in Patagonia, but bad weather had forced us to turn back.
So we were excited the minute we saw the Windex-blue ice floes
mining LeConte Bay. The crackling of the glacial chunks made us
feel as if we were cruising through a bowl of Rice Krispies. The
floes got bigger and bluer as we traveled closer, until we finally
stopped, 400 yards away from the glacier itself, the biggest and
bluest berg of all.
</P>
<P>
   At that distance, you see things happen before you hear them. By
the time we heard the thundering explosion of a huge piece of ice
calving, the event was over. So we scanned the horizon diligently,
hoping to rest our eyes on the exact spot where the next bus-sized
chunk would break off the glacier and plunge into the water below.
</P>
<P>
   In the ship's central corridor, Margie McGregor, the cruise's
coordinator and staff naturalist, posted a list of wildlife seen
during the cruise. For the first few days, it remained fairly
short: a group of orcas as we moved toward LeConte Glacier, a few
bald eagles, and a mountain goat that was hard to see even with
binoculars. But by Day 5, as we cruised through Glacier Bay,
additions came fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   Humpback whales were a major reason to brave the cold on deck.
At first they were identifiable only by their plumes of mist in the
water, but as we got closer, we could make out heads, fins, tails.
None of the whales did a Shamu-worthy leap out of the water, but
dozens breached within gasping distance of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier Bay was where we also got our first grizzly bear
sighting. A mother and her two cubs frolicked on a hill above the
shoreline, oblivious to our presence 200 feet away. Seals and sea
lions were plentiful, often napping atop ice floes. Sea otters
swam, dived, chased each other through kelp, or simply lay on their
backs while eating shellfish off their chests. A family of puffins
floated silently off the starboard side.
</P>
<P>
   Each time an animal was sighted, a crowd jumped up to see, yet
the person who seemed the most excited was Margie, who presumably
had seen all these critters many times before. Only Big Al Carter,
who delivered the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies to the
lounge each afternoon, was more popular.
</P>
<P>
   That morning in Glacier Bay had started out foggy, but by late
afternoon it was sunny and I was in shorts and a T-shirt on the top
deck, working on my tan. The gloriously sunny 75-degree weather
followed us for the last three days of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning in Skagway, Lisa and I went ashore and biked to
the ghost town of Dyea, 10 miles away. During the Klondike Gold
Rush of 1898, this boomtown was the last place where prospectors
could stock up before setting off on the Chilkoot Trail. Two years
later, when the White Pass and Yukon Railroad chose Skagway for its
depot, Dyea literally disappeared. Even the boards used for the
houses and stores were carted up and moved to Skagway. Today, the
Alaska Highway dead-ends in Dyea, so there's little automobile
traffic. All that remains is a cemetery and some historical markers
showing where things used to be.
</P>
<P>
   We pedaled up one finger of the Taiya Inlet and down another,
looping back and forth several times until we reached Dyea. Along
the way, vistas proliferated, each more picturesque than the last,
where the snow-capped purple mountains perfectly framed the
landscape of teal waters and evergreen forest.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to Skagway, we saw that the quaint, sleepy town
(population 806) had been overrun by thousands of shoppers from the
two cruise ships that dwarfed our little boat in port. People
packed stores selling T-shirts, fudge and overpriced gold trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   In Haines, late that afternoon, our timing was more auspicious.
The bigger boats go to Haines too, but they didn't show up that day
until after we left. When our little boat arrived, the port was
empty except for three extremely warm-blooded (some might say
foolhardy) souls bobbing in the 45-degree water around the pier.
Lisa and I chose a rafting excursion through the Chilkat Bald Eagle
Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   This was no death-defying trip through whitewater canyons. The
shallow river's current moved slowly and steadily, while Sarah, our
strong-armed 20-year-old guide, did all the rowing for our
eight-passenger raft, leaving us free to watch for wildlife. Bald
eagles were plentiful _ we saw more than a dozen _ but the heat of
the day scared off wolves, moose and grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   When we disembarked the last day in Juneau, we joined the crowds
of other cruise ship tourists in the stores and restaurants buying
postcards and smoked salmon. But we wanted one more uncrowded
Alaskan experience before we returned home. So we abandoned the
shopping streets in favor of a web of hiking trails, where the
city's water supply cascaded through mossy glens.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-mile hike, I looked at a map of Alaska. Over the
entire nine-day cruise, we had gone fewer than 500 miles. We hadn't
even set foot on mainland Alaska. At our rate of travel, it would
take us more than a thousand weeks to see the entire state. But we
returned home wishing not that we had seen more places, but that we
had had more time to explore the ones we did.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   MORE INFORMATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cruise West has three different tours of the Inside Passage,
leaving from Juneau, Ketchikan, or Seattle. Some tours may be
combined with air, rail and bus transportation through mainland
Alaska (including Anchorage, Fairbanks and Denali National Park),
or with a three- or four-night cruise of Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska ships carry 78 to 102 passengers, the Prince William
Sound ships 52 to 108. All tours are sold out for this year. Prices
depend on size of cabin, size of ship, length of trip and time of
year. For a typical nine-day cruise of the Inside Passage next
year, the costs will range from just under $3,000 a person for the
smallest double occupancy cabin to $4,895 a person for a deluxe
cabin in July. At least one shore excursion (a walk with guides or
sightseeing by bus) is included in each port of call. Call (800)
888-9378 for a video, schedule and rate information, or visit
www.cruisewest.com.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's Glacier Bay Tours and Cruises offers tours similar to
those provided by Cruise West, but the company also has two
itineraries for people who want to be out in the wilderness at all
times. These ships stop not in cities along the way, but in places
where you can drop a kayak off the top deck and paddle near a
glacier, or hike through national forest areas where eagles are
known to nest.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier Bay ships carry 34 to 88 passengers (the smaller boats
are for wilderness cruises). Tours are booked for this year. Rates
for 2001 range from $1,680 a person, double occupancy, for the most
rugged six-night wilderness cruise, to $3,780 for a seven-night
port-to-port trip, shore excursions included. Call (800) 451-5952
for a brochure and video, or go to www &QL;

LEAFING THROUGH THE BOOKS OF AUTUMN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JEFF GUINN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The kings are dead. Long live the new kings _ whoever they turn
out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Fall 2000 finds the book industry at an unexpected crossroads.
For the past few decades, so-called ``entertainment'' fiction
writers have dominated bestseller lists, then disappeared (remember
Arthur Hailey, anyone?), but the mainstays of recognized literary
excellence could always be counted on to sell hundreds of thousands
of books, in addition to garnering ongoing critical kudos.
</P>
<P>
   But while the better-known ``pop'' fiction writers have
continued to flourish _ John Grisham's ``The Brethren'' sold 2
million copies and J.K. Rowling's ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' has sold 3.8 million and counting _ the old heavyweights
have begun to stumble. In recent months, literary lions Philip Roth
(''The Human Stain'') and John Updike (''Gertrude and Claudius'')
have had first-rate novels published _ and neither sold well. Other
longtime reliables like Thomas Sanchez (''Day of the Bees'') and
the late Joseph Heller (''Portrait of an Artist, As a Young Man'')
have also failed to ring many cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it's time to wonder just who will be proclaimed the
next ``great'' writer. Several candidates, including Jane Hamilton,
Ha Jin, Barry Lopez, Kazuo Ishiguro, William Gay, David Hollander,
Terry Kay and Rick Moody all have books being published between
Sept. 1 and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, veteran ``literary'' writers will be fighting for
attention as well in the coming months _ Tom Wolfe, Margaret
Atwood, Gore Vidal, Alice Walker, Larry McMurtry, Barbara
Kingsolver and Armistead Maupin all have imminent titles. Updike,
not one to give up easily, is back for another try.
</P>
<P>
   Historians Stephen Ambrose, Richard Ben Cramer, David Levering
Lewis and William J. Cooper, among others, deliver much-anticipated
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the highbrow is crowding out the mass-market offerings.
Bestseller list perennials Anne Rice, Patricia Cornwell, John
Sandford, Dave Barry and Jonathan Kellerman are back this fall.
More professional wrestlers have penned their memoirs. Even the
Beatles have a book they'd like you to buy.
</P>
<P>
   So it's going to be an interesting, if uncertain, literary
winter. Here's our annual guide to the books that are heading for
the shelves, with special attention to the best and the most
promising.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST OF THE OLD GUARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Way Forward Is With a Broken Heart'' by Alice Walker
(Random House, October). It seems odd to think that a former
Pulitzer Prize winner could be in a make-or-break situation. But
many critics _ as well as many of her loyal readers _ believe
Walker hasn't really offered much since 1982's ``The Color
Purple.'' (Quick: Name even one of her subsequent books.) A look at
the galley proof of ``The Way Forward Is With a Broken Heart''
indicates that Alice Walker did, indeed, have more than one great
book in her. It's a mesmerizing collection of short fiction based
on experiences in the author's life.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Boone's Lick'' by Larry McMurtry (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
November). Whether McMurtry wants to face it or not, what the
reading public wants from him is western fiction. After some time
off from his signature genre for two first-person ruminations
(''Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen'' and ``Roads'') and an
excellent, if overlooked, novel (''Duane's Depressed''), McMurtry
has another western yarn to offer. This one follows the lives of
the Cecil family as fate draws them toward the Fetterman Massacre
of 1866.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Hooking Up'' by Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux,
October). No, it's not another meganovel. Instead, ``Hooking Up''
comprises reprints of novellas originally published in magazines,
plus some essays. After ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ``A Man
in Full,'' it's easy to forget that Wolfe cut his literary teeth
with groundbreaking magazine work. ``Hooking Up'' will remind you
that Tom Wolfe is an author of ``great'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The Blind Assassin'' by Margaret Atwood (Doubleday/Nan A.
Talese, September). Every Atwood book has some specific theme, some
point it intends to make. But while ``The Blind Assassin'' isn't
going to be as easy to decipher as, say, ``The Handmaid's Tale,''
this convoluted novel-within-a-novel _ the protagonist wants to
find out if her sister's death was really accidental, only to have
her story eclipsed by a seemingly unrelated second story _ will
reward readers who stick with it.

   Honorable mentions ``The Golden Age'' by Gore Vidal (Doubleday,
September): another installment in the saga of the fictional
Sanford family. ``Pagan Babies'' by Elmore Leonard (Dell,
September): A priest may not be a priest _ so, what is he?. ``The
Night Listener'' by Armistead Maupin (HarperCollins, $26): Radio
writer bonds with an abused child. ``Licks of Love'' by John Updike
(Knopf, November): short stories and ``Rabbit Remembered,'' a coda
on Harry Angstrom.

   CONTENDERS FOR THE THRONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Disobedience'' by Jane Hamilton (Doubleday, October). Too
many critics have dismissed Jane Hamilton as simply the product of
Oprah's Book Club. Reverse snobbism being what it is,
anti-Oprahites have failed to see the immense quality of ``A Map of
the World'' and ``The Book of Ruth.'' But ``Disobedience'' may just
put an end to such carping. In this compelling story, 17-year-old
Henry Shaw reads his mother's e-mail, with disastrous results. Life
will never be the same again _ and, in Hamilton's gifted literary
hands, how Henry changes and why is a story to be savored.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Bridegroom: Stories'' by Ha Jin (Pantheon, October).
Last year, Ha Jin was a surprise National Book Award winner for the
novel ``Waiting.'' Now he returns with short fiction about Chinese
men and women adjusting to life in the West. The literary quality
cannot be denied, but will a large audience of non-Chinese readers
really go out and buy the book? Let's hope so, because Ha Jin
deserves to be a major literary figure.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Demonology: Stories'' by Rick Moody (Little, Brown &AMP; Co.,
December/January). You'd be hard-pressed to find any critic or
fellow writer who wouldn't praise Moody's ``Garden State'' or ``The
Ice Storm.'' The man is simply a marvel; his prose yanks audiences
into odd reading rhythms that somehow turn out just right _ sort of
like Miles Davis experimenting with the limits of jazz. Yet Moody's
quirky and complex work hasn't built a large audience.
``Demonology: Stories'' probably won't change that, and we should
be glad he hasn't compromised his unique voice for greater sales.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mentions ``L.I.E.'' by David Hollander (Villard,
September): interwoven stories about riders on the Long Island
Expressway. ``When We Were Orphans'' by Kazuo Ishiguro (Knopf,
September): After being orphaned there at age 9, man returns to
Shanghai 20 years later. ``Taking Lottie Home'' by Terry Kay
(Morrow, October): Ex-ballplayers meet a woman who changes their
lives. ``Light Action in the Caribbean'' by Barry Lopez (Knopf,
November): short fiction from a master writer. ``Provinces of
Night'' by William Gay (Doubleday, December): After 20 years, a man
returns to backwoods Tennessee and the family he abandoned.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CERTAIN BESTSELLERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Prodigal Summer'' by Barbara Kingsolver (HarperCollins,
November). It's time to come out and say it: Circa 2000, Barbara
Kingsolver is the best writer currently dominating the bestseller
list. That doesn't mean she's the best writer, period, but she's
certainly the finest craftsman to sell in the hundreds of
thousands. ``Prodigal Summer'' is more of what her legion of fans
expect _ a solid story about Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist who
finds more than her work to think about in Southern Appalachia. If
that sounds like an outtake of a Nora Roberts novel, think again.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Devil's Code'' by John Sandford (Putnam, October).
Sandford has made his bestseller mark with cop Lucas Davenport and
the ``Prey'' mystery franchise, but his other ongoing series _
following artist/computer whiz/professional criminal Kidd _ is even
better. High-tech high jinks abound here as Kidd tries to crack a
case where the bad guys are linked to government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down'' by Dave Barry
(Crown, October): One of the subjects is low-flow toilets _ hence
the title. Yes, the humor is often sophomoric, but that doesn't
prevent it from being laugh-out-loud funny and often right on
point. Sales of the last few collections of Barry's newspaper
columns have dipped; this one should mark his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mentions ``Merrick'' by Anne Rice (Knopf, October): A
new tale that ``weaves the witches' world with the vampires'
world.'' ``The Last Precinct'' by Patricia Cornwell (Putnam,
November): Kay Scarpetta tries to solve an ages-old mystery. ``Dr.
Death'' by Jonathan Kellerman (Random House, December): When a
doctor famed for assisting suicides dies himself, Dr. Alex Delaware
gets involved.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BALLYHOOED NONFICTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life'' by Richard Ben Cramer
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, November). There is simply no other nonfiction
writer like Cramer. His ability to get inside the heads of his
subjects is uncanny. That's why this book, all about the
ultra-reclusive Yankee Clipper, is one of the most highly
anticipated titles of the fall.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``W.E.B. Du Bois: The Fight for Equality and the American
Century'' by David Levering Lewis (Henry Holt, October). This is
the second installment of a three-part biography, and Part I won
the Pulitzer. As Lewis continues to demonstrate why W.E.B. Du Bois
was surely one of the greatest Americans of any era, he also makes
it clear that a second Pulitzer isn't out of the question. It would
be wise, though, to pick up a copy of volume one before tackling
volume two.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Sex &AMP; Power'' by Susan Estrich (Putnam, September). Guess
what _ women still aren't getting an even break. What makes
Estrich's book different is that she doesn't waste pages and
chapters bemoaning the obvious. Rather, Estrich focuses on women
themselves and asks what mistakes they may be making that lead to
ongoing prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``A Life in the Twentieth Century'' by Arthur M. Schlesinger
Jr. (Houghton Mifflin, November). Schlesinger, the former JFK aide
who has won two Pulitzers for previous books, finally views past
decades through the lens of his own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Rabbi Jesus'' by Bruce Chilton (Doubleday, October).
Chilton, a professor/priest, presents Jesus here as a man and a
teacher of his time. This is the sort of book that gets discussed
on radio talk shows; no matter what your personal religious
leanings, or lack of same, you'll probably find much here to talk
about with your own family and friends. It's safe to predict that
those who insist every word in the Bible is absolute historical
fact won't be praising ``Rabbi Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mentions ``The Prince of Tennessee: The Rise of Al
Gore'' by David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
September): Maraniss, whose biography of Bill Clinton is considered
one of the best and most objective, takes on Gore. ``Nothing Like
It in the World'' by Stephen Ambrose (Simon &AMP; Schuster, September):
the story of the transcontinental railroad. ``Off Camera: Private
Thoughts Made Public'' by Ted Koppel (Knopf, September):
supposedly, all the things he didn't mention on TV. ``Natural
Blonde'' by Liz Smith (Hyperion, September): Fort Worth's own
celebrity chronicler tells her life story. ``Singing Him My Song''
by Malachy McCourt (HarperCollins, October): second
autobiographical installment from Frank McCourt's brother. ``A
Short Guide to a Happy Life'' by Anna Quindlen (Random House,
October): Columnist says she's going to explain ``how to fully
engage our days.'' ``King: The Photobiography of Martin Luther King
Jr.'' by Charles Johnson and Bob Adelman (Viking, November):
Advertised as great prose illuminated by equally great photography.
</P>
<P>
   THE WRASSLERS: The last two autobiographies of World Wrestling
Federation superstars _ Mick Foley and Dwayne ``The Rock'' Johnson
_ both hit No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, and Chyna
plans to be the third with Chyna (HarperCollins, September). Also
from the grunt brigrade, ``Do I Stand Alone?'' by
grappler-turned-governor Jesse Ventura (Pocket, September) and
``I'm Next'' by Goldberg (Crown, November).
</P>
<P>
   THE GREAT UNKNOWN: Putnam's fall catalog promises a new novel by
the very talented Amy Tan _ but details aren't available because
Tan is going to be working on it right up until the presses begin
to roll.
</P>
<P>
   MOST INTRIGUING BOOK: Stephen King's ``On Writing: A Memoir of
the Craft'' (Scribner, October) is rumored to be as much a
confessional as a how-to.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BOOK BY AN UNKNOWN AUTHOR: You heard it here _ ``The Blood
Runs Like a River Through My Dreams,'' a memoir by Native-American
writer Nasdijj (Houghton Mifflin, October), is going to be huge.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOST PERSONAL MEMOIR: The author of the justly praised ``The
Liar's Club'' continues with the story of her teen years, including
``the thrills and terrors of her sexual awakening,'' with
``Cherry'' by Mary Karr (Viking, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH, ALREADY: ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of
Richard Nixon'' by Anthony Summers (Viking, September). It seems
legislation will be needed to stop the endless flow of books about
the alleged misdeeds of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   THE SADDEST BOOK: ``Never Die Easy'' by Walter Payton, with Don
Yaeger (Villard, September). The Chicago Bears all-time great
running back died of liver cancer before this book hit print. Much
of his message here is a lesson in courageous acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   SERPENT'S TOOTH AWARD: Margaret A. Salinger, daughter of J.D.,
offers ``Reflections on Reclusion'' (Pocket, September). First an
ex-lover, now a daughter. Can't a reclusive genius writer trust
``anybody?''
</P>
<P>
   A BOOK EVERYONE SHOULD READ: ``An American Story'' by Debra J.
Dickinson (Pantheon, September) is about growing up under difficult
racial and emotional circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE _ AND A FAT WALLET: After so many books
about them, the three surviving Beatles tell their own stories in
``The Beatles Anthology'' (Chronicle Books, October). There's no
telling how much is ghostwritten, though, and it's pricey _ $60.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOOK WE NEEDED LEAST: ``All That Glitters Is Not Gold'' by
Marla Maples (ReganBooks, $24). Another ex-wife of The Donald
spills her guts.

 &HT;    'Creative economy' may become the new economy
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The ``new economy'' some day will be the old economy.
By that time, the new economy will be the ``creative economy,''
according to Business Week (Aug. 21-28).
</P>
<P>
   The magazine takes a stab in its cover story at predicting what
the corporation of the 21st century will be like, with the aim of
helping existing companies ``thrive in the decades ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many surprises pop up in Business Week's forecast, but the
ones that do are attention-grabbers. For one, the magazine suggests
that investors are likely to lose influence. That's because the
``commodity they supply _ money _ is no longer scarce,'' Business
Week offers. ``What's scarce are the good ideas,'' the magazine
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Business Week: Too much of a good thing is hurting the
reputation of Stanford University's MBA program. So many grads are
starting their own businesses or taking jobs in Silicon Valley that
some major companies have given up trying to recruit at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate entertainment
</P>
<P>
   Wired (September) has something for anyone with a passing
interest in Time Warner or America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine suggests that Time Warner brings more than content
and delivery systems to its planned merger with America Online.
According to Wired, the little extra involves ``a long history of
amazingly expert corporate infighting, ankle-biting, and all-around
backstabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's advice to Chairman Steve Case of America Online
is fairly simple: confiscate the long knives.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune's annual list of fastest growing companies shows up in
the Aug. 14 issue. Companies are ranked on earnings per share
growth, revenue growth and total return _ change in stock price
plus any dividends. The magazine measures the companies over a
three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Three Atlanta-based companies made this year's list: Profit
Recovery Group International is 59th, down from 40th a year
earlier; AHL Services is 71st; and Nova is 98th. Neither of the
latter two was ranked last year.
</P>
<P>
   4Kids Entertainment _ a beneficiary of Pokemon _ took the top
spot on the Fortune list.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell
</P>
<P>
   Looking for the next sure thing? Kiplinger's (September) offers
some bets _ not for this quarter or this year _ but for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine claims to have spotted nine companies ``standing on
the brink of enormous gains in revenue and profit.'' Kiplinger's
goes on to acknowledge that there are on guarantees in investing,
but says the nine it picked ``are as close as it gets to slam dunks
in coming years.'' The nine are Applied Biosystems, Genentech,
Medimmune, Flextronics, American Tower, Maxim Integrated Products,
VeriSign, Charles Schwab and Capital One Financial.
</P>
<P>
   More change is afoot
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout of Internet incubators has eliminated some of the
exuberance investors in the industry felt not long ago, notes the
Economist (Aug. 12-18). The magazine looks at some of the weakness
in the industry and at how some incubators are changing.

 &HT;    A refreshing dive into some of Florida's freshest, coolest
waters
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ginnie Springs
</P>
<P>
   7300 N. E. Ginnie Springs Road, High Springs. Phone: (904)
454-2202.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A second-magnitude spring, Ginnie has a
flow of 29 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 72 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: While kids floated in bright-colored inner tubes and
boats, divers searched the caves below. We could see the bubbles
from the air tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Ginnie Springs is an extremely pretty place, with its turquoise
waters and its shady campgrounds. It's easy to understand why
divers from all over the world come here.
</P>
<P>
   You actually get seven springs for the price of one (Deer, Twin,
Dogwood, Ginnie and three that are part of the Devil Spring
system). All of them dot the Santa Fe River. The clear, blue spring
water provides a stark contrast to the dark, tannin-stained river.
When the two mix, as they do at the river's edge, the results are
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: More divers learn to cavern and cave dive at
Ginnie Springs than anywhere else, according to the Ginnie Springs
Web site. Be warned: If you want to explore the caves, you must be
certified. Cave diving can be dangerous. At least 27 divers have
lost their lives here.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Swimming, diving, tubing, canoeing, kayaking,
hiking, camping, picnicking.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $7 per person, per day.
</P>
<P>
   Homosassa Springs
</P>
<P>
   4150 S. Suncoast Blvd, Homosassa. Phone: (352) 628-5343.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Homosassa has a
flow of 113.8 million gallons per day
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 75 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Unless you swim with them, you're probably not going
to get any closer to a manatee than you will inside the ``fish
bowl,'' a sort of reverse aquarium. The bowl allows visitors to go
below the surface of the water and watch the manatees as they munch
on carrots and lettuce and swim inches away from the glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also see turtles and a variety of saltwater and
freshwater fish that can travel unrestricted between the headwaters
and the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Also fun: the zoo, which features a 40-year-old hippo, a couple
of American bald eagles, a silver fox, a Florida black bear,
alligators galore, lots of flamingos and other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: The park is a rehabilitation center and refuge
for endangered West Indian manatees that have been orphaned or
injured in the wild. Most of the birds and animals living at
Homosassa could not survive in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Educational programs about manatee, alligators, and
wildlife encounters. Picnicking, hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $7.95 for adults (age 13 and over), $ 4.95 for
children ages 3 through 12; free for kids under 3.
</P>
<P>
   Manatee Springs State Park
</P>
<P>
   11650 N.W. 115 St., Chiefland. Phone: (352) 493-6072.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Manatee has a
flow of 116.9 million gallons per day
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 72 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Surrounded by cypress, gum, ash, and maple trees,
Manatee Springs is an ideal place for canoe rides.
</P>
<P>
   The morning we visited, the swimming area was beginning to fill
with children and their mothers. A trio of moms were doing some
serious toe-dipping and then retreating up the stairs to warm up on
the park benches. The kids didn't seem to mind a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: Located on the Suwannee River just 23 miles
upstream from the Gulf of Mexico, the park consists of 2,075 acres.
It opened to the public in 1955. At this spring, you need to visit
in fall or winter months to see the manatee.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Picnicking, fishing, swimming, canoeing, hiking and
biking on the 8.5-mile north end trail system, scuba diving, nature
study and camping.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $3.25 per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Poe Springs
</P>
<P>
   28800 N.W. 182 Ave., High Springs. Phone: (904) 454-1992
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A second-magnitude springs, Poe has a flow
of 60 million gallons per day
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 73 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: A cypress nature walk leads you through the woods to a
splendid, blue-green swimming hole. The day we arrived, it was full
of summer campers. The trek to the spring is long, but a dip in the
cool swimming hole makes up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Poe is along the winding course of the Santa Fe River. It is
owned by Alachua County and managed by the North Central Florida
YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: Moonlight canoe trips are routinely scheduled
(Sept. 16, Oct. 14 and Nov. 11) on the Santa Fe to Poe Springs
park. Tiki torches light the bank of the river. Tickets are $25 and
includes a picnic lunch.)
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Swimming, boating, picnicking, hiking, camping.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $4 per person
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Springs
</P>
<P>
   9158 S.W. 81st Pl. Road, Dunnellon. Phone: (352) 489-8503.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude springs, Rainbow has a
flow of 493.2 million gallons per day
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 70 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Rainbow is a good description for these multi-colored
waters. We sat outside of the snack bar sipping lemonade and
watching swimmers and canoers in the magnificent waters below. The
view is awesome.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Springs State Park drew 112,000 visitors in 1999. With
the park's elegant gardens and three waterfalls built in the '30s,
tourists and locals love it. We did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: In the 1930s at the spring, a lodge,
bathhouses, gift shop, boat dock and picnic pavilion were built. A
glass-bottom boat launched in 1934. In 1939 came a reptile exhibit,
alligators, monkeys and tropical birds. By 1967, after a few more
owners, Sperry &AMP; Hutchinson (of S&AMP;H Green Stamp fame) and Holiday
Inns bought the attraction and pumped money into it. In 1990,
Marion County paid $1 million and the state of Florida $9.26
million to buy the 55-acre, long-closed family attraction and 910
surrounding acres off U.S. 41 in Dunnellon.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Swimming, snorkeling, tubing,diving, hiking,
canoeing, picnicking.
</P>
<P>
   Admission cost: $1
</P>
<P>
   Silver Springs
</P>
<P>
   5656 E. Silver Springs Blvd., Silver Springs. Phone: (352)
236-2121. www.silversprings.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Silver spews 532
million gallons per day _ the largest known flow in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 76 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: In 1859, an archaeologist, John LeConte, wrote that
the most remarkable feature of this place was ``the truly
extraordinary transparency of the water ... surpassing anything
which can be imagined.'' His assessment holds true today, not only
for Silver Springs, but all of the springs we visited.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, swimming is allowed only on weekends. And,
since we arrived on a Friday, we spent the day taking a
glass-bottom boat ride, a jungle cruise and strolling through the
gardens and the petting zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Local legend has it that if people have their picture taken
standing surrounded by the trunk of the horseshoe palm tree at the
water's edge, they will have five years of good luck. We stuffed
lottery tickets in our pockets and posed with the lucky tree. (No
winners, to date, but we have have our fingers crossed.)
</P>
<P>
   Interesting facts: The glass-bottom boat, invented in 1878 by
Hullam Jones, made its debut here in 1910 and has been a popular
attraction ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Weismuller came here to film Tarzan movies. But he
wasn't the only star to work in Silver Springs. Others include
Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman for Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' ``The
Yearling''; Esther Williams for ``Jupiter's Darling,'' Gary Cooper
for ``Distant Drums,'' and Lloyd Bridges for more than 100 episodes
of ``Sea Hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Reptile shows, boat rides, petting zoo, monkey
island, playland for kids, an antique and race car show, swimming,
and concerts. There's a large water park near the springs. The park
also hosts a concert series with country acts.
</P>
<P>
   Admission cost: $30.95 for adults; $21.95 for kids 3-10.
</P>
<P>
   Wakulla Springs
</P>
<P>
   550 Wakulla Park Drive, Wakulla Springs, 32305. Phone: (850)
224-5950.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Wakulla has a
flow of 252 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 73 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Tarzan movies were filmed here and Old Joe (a
12-foot-long, 650-pound, 200-year-old dead alligator) is enshrined
in the lodge. There's a great swimming hole, diving ramps, and a
1937 lodge with marble floors, an ornate lobby ceiling, antique
furniture and what looks like one of the first elevators ever made.
</P>
<P>
   But what really lifted our spirits was the glass-bottom boat
ride. The guide, clearly a fan of fishing, diving and tale-telling,
had us applauding Henry, the pole-vaulting fish.
</P>
<P>
   After the guide hollered out to the reel star, (Hen-REEEEE!) we
watched as the black bass, less than a foot long, sailed out and
flopped over a cypress pole several feet under water. Henry, or his
descendants, have been doing the stunt since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: Wakulla has been a tourist favorite since the
1930s. The park has the world's largest and deepest freshwater
springs and is surrounded by 3,000 acres of virgin forest. Ponce de
Leon discovered the springs in 1513 and thought it was the fountain
of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Hiking trails, picnic areas, swimming, diving, boat
rides ($4.50).
</P>
<P>
   Admission cost: $3.25 per vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Warm Mineral Springs
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between Sarasota and Fort Myers. Take U.S. 41 to Ortiz
Road right to the springs. Phone: (941) 426-1692
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A third-magnitude spring, Warm Mineral has
a flow of 9 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 87 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: People come here believing that the high mineral
content restores vigor. They say it helps people with muscular
problems, arthritis and rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
   The bathers we saw were elderly. There's a gift shop with terry
cover-ups, bathing caps, knickknacks and a lot of pamphlets on
staying healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say Warm Mineral Springs was Ponce de Leon's destination
when he came to this country in search of the fountain of youth in
1513. We thought the resort, which is privately owned, looked like
it needed a face lift.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: Warm Mineral Springs, which is listed in the
National Register of Historic Places, is Florida's only truly warm
spring open to the public. The water has five times more mineral
content than all other famous spas in the world, including Hot
Springs, Ark., and Baden Baden, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the spring was founded in the 1800s, although
archaeological evidence shows that people lived here more than
10,000 years ago. The resort was built in the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Bathing, swimming, picnicking.
</P>
<P>
   Admission cost: No charge just to look, but if you want to swim,
or even stick your toes in the water, you'll pay $10 ($5 for kids).
</P>
<P>
   Weeki Wachee
</P>
<P>
   45 minutes north of Tampa at the intersection of U.S. 9 and
State Road 50. Phone: (877)-GO-WEEKI or www.weekiwachee.com
</P>
<P>
   How big is the boil? A first-magnitude spring, Weeki Wachee has
a flow of 113 million gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   Average water temperature: 75 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Our view: Although The Little Mermaid show in the Weeki Wachee
amphitheater is geared to kids, adults will be amused. The high
school boy, who seemed to run the show, not only sold popcorn, but
played the tambourine during the performance and made sure kids
weren't clogging up the stairways. On the other side of the glass,
the mermaids swam and lip-synched to recorded songs, taking breaths
of air from hoses.
</P>
<P>
   We recommend the wilderness river cruise, or the ``geezer''
cruise, as I like to call it. Our grandfatherly guide, with his
Rodney Dangerfield delivery, told silly jokes that fell on mostly
deaf ears because most of the passengers were kids or from foreign
countries. You had to be over 45 to get his punch lines. But more
than the funny old man, the cruise was a delight because pelicans
and egrets guided the boat down the river. We saw dozens of birds
in such a very short time. Most of them were healthy, but we saw
some wounded guys, as well, at the pelican orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   Also spotted: a pair of manatee and a raccoon.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting fact: Mermaids began performing at Weeki Wachee in
1947 when Navy frogman Newton Perry built the underwater theater 45
minutes north of Tampa. Some of the famous guests the mermaids have
entertained include Elvis Presley, Esther Williams, Don Knotts and
Howard Cosell.
</P>
<P>
   Activities: Live mermaid shows, nature boat tour, swimming,
diving, canoeing, water slides, petting zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Admission cost: $14.95 for adults; $10.95 for children 3-10

   What is a spring?
</P>
<P>
   A spring is an opening at or near the surface of the earth where
water from underground sources flows. Florida's springs are formed
because of the porous limestone topography.
</P>
<P>
   After it rains, the water infiltrates the earth and seeps down,
replenishing the aquifer below. Some of the water moves slowly
through spaces the size of grains of sand. Other water moves
quickly down through sinks and swallet holes.
</P>
<P>
   Deep underground, this water then moves horizontally along
bedding planes and fractures. This is where the moving water
dissolves the rock, creating a network of underground conduits.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's springs are especially large and productive because of
the tremendous size of the aquifer that supports them. The springs
here are artesian, rising from an artesian aquifer that holds water
trapped beneath impermeable clay or nonporous bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Florida's springs are in the north-central part of the
state, where the aquifer is near the surface and where rivers have
gnawed through confining clay beds.

ALASKA TOURISM IS HOT, AND SO IS THE DEBATE ABOUT ITS EFFECTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not so long ago that most of Alaska was cloaked in
anonymity, and the idea that more than half a million people a year
would pay money to visit a waterlogged fishing village or come
within smelling distance of a grizzly bear was laughable. Towns
that had seen their last mines sealed, their timber mills shuttered
and their fishing docks empty huddled against the elements, the
people wondering whether one last boom would come their way.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many outsiders, Alaska was too cold, too wild,
too remote. But those very words have become the selling points of
a $1 billion tourism industry that has exceeded even the wildest
projections. Visits have tripled since 1980, and tourism has caught
up with fishing to become the state's second largest industry,
behind oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   But even as cash registers clank and whirr from Deadhorse, in
the far north, to Sitka, in the southeastern rain forest, an effort
to rein in explosive growth has taken hold and appears to be
gaining momentum. Some of the people who live in the coastal towns
that have had their economies transformed by the cruise ship
industry are trying to limit visits.
</P>
<P>
   In the national parks, which used to be some of the loneliest
places on the planet, the number of visitors has doubled in 10
years, and officials say the crowds at some sites are threatening
the very thing that is their draw _ the sense of wildness.
Backpackers, kayakers and sports fishers are complaining about
excessive helicopter flights, Jet Skis and group fishing tours.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism itself is not under fire. There is nary an Alaskan
village, from the Bering Sea to the roadless interior, that does
not welcome visitors. What bothers many Alaskans is the onslaught
of ``industrial tourism,'' a term coined by the environmental
writer Edward Abbey to describe mass tourism and its effects _ in
Moab, Utah, for example, the crush of visitors has damaged the
fragile desert and forced federal officials to limit visitation to
some areas. People also fear that the singular character of the
state is changing as Alaskans conform to the expectations of large
tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that the people coming to see Alaska ultimately
won't see it,'' said Kelley Weaverling, a former mayor of the
fishing village of Cordova, on Prince William Sound, who runs a
bookstore in the town. ``When I first came here, this place was
almost prehistoric. Now, it's in danger of becoming very
Disneyfied.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cordova is the kind of town where dogs fall asleep in the middle
of the road and relentless rain wraps the town in a towel of
moisture nine months a year. It is known for the fleet that brings
in the first wild salmon of the year, from the nearby Copper River.
But its quirky charms have been discovered by some of the biggest
tourism operators in the world _ to mixed reception.
</P>
<P>
   When Princess Cruises and Tours recently announced that it would
be building a $10 million, 100-room lodge on 200 acres of the
Copper River, a wild expanse of glacial runoff that feeds one of
biggest wetlands in the Western Hemisphere, it was hailed by the
company as a new frontier in Alaska tourism. The lodge would border
the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve _ at 13 million
acres, the largest unit in the National Park system. Princess
officials described the lodge plan as a way for visitors to
experience ``one of the state's best-kept secrets,'' and said it
would not harm the marine ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   But while new lodges are welcomed for the construction and
service jobs they bring, small tour operators and wilderness
advocates fear that much of the state's tourism is being ceded to
foreign-owned interests. Princess, a subsidiary of the London-based
shipping company P&AMP;O, runs four big lodges in Alaska, 10 private
rail cars between Fairbanks and Anchorage, numerous buses, and a
fleet of ships carrying more than 200,000 people a year to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruise ships are kind of like colonists,'' said Weaverling,
referring to the companies that run the lines. ``They come in their
own large ships. They put people on their own tour buses. They
build their own lodges. Until, finally the cruise ship visitor
never sees an actual Alaskan unless it's somebody who made their
bed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dean Brown, an executive vice president at Princess, scoffs at
such characterizations. Alaska cruise ship passengers, he said,
defy the stereotype of sedentary seniors tied to the cocoon of the
cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people used to come to Juneau or Sitka, they wanted to
ride a tour bus,'' said Brown. ``Now they want to kayak, or
ice-climb or canoe or hike to a glacier _ and we don't own any of
those attractions or the services built around them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for fears of Alaska's being loved to death, the solution,
according to state tourism officials and some cruise line
executives, is to spread out the visitors. ``People forget that
Alaska is a huge land mass, and we have a million visitors a year _
just a fraction of what Hawaii gets,'' said Ginny Fay, director of
tourism for the state. ``We just need to disperse our visitors
more.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown pointed to the plan to build a lodge on the Copper River
as an example of how the major tour operators were trying to move
visitors out of crowded areas.
</P>
<P>
   The most vocal and organized opposition to the growth of the
cruise ship industry is in Juneau, the state capital, where more
than 630,000 passengers are expected this year, in a town of 30,000
_ a nearly 50 percent increase over the last five years. The
biggest of the 540 ships that will tie up in Juneau this summer is
the 10-story Sea Princess, which is taller than the highest
building in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   Juneau residents complain about excessive noise, air and water
pollution, and crowds from the cruise ships, which usually dock in
the morning and leave in the evening of the same day. Helicopter
and small-plane sightseeing tours, working with the cruise ships,
have made the skies around Juneau a zone of noise and air clutter
in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `Apocalypse Now,''' said Kimberly Metcalfe-Helmar, a
Juneau resident who has helped to promote two ballot initiatives to
limit tourism related to cruise ships. ``You just can't get away
from the noise. If you're on your favorite hiking trail, there may
be six helicopters overhead. People are fed up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the outrage, voters in Juneau last year bucked the
cruise ship industry and Alaska's political leaders. Seventy
percent of voters agreed to put a $5 a person tax on every arriving
cruise ship passenger. The money is used for hospitals, parks,
roads and other parts of the city that are burdened by heavy
visitation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Juneau residents are likely to vote on the so-called
Peace and Quiet Initiative, which would restrict helicopter flights
in the area. It is being promoted by some bed-and-breakfast owners,
who stress that they are not against tourism but are unhappy at the
growth of mass tourism. A Web site run by Crondahls' Bed &AMP;
Breakfast in Juneau (www.juneaucrondahls.com) has links to the
campaign, with pictures of ships belching smoke into the sky above
the clear harbor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   North of Juneau, the town of Haines voted last year to limit the
number of cruise ships that can dock. But in nearby Skagway, a
former ghost town that had its glory years during the Gold Rush,
the ships are welcome, as they bring more than 8,000 passengers a
week to a village of 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry responded to the campaigns in Haines and
Juneau by cutting donations to the arts and canceling some visits.
Princess pulled out of Haines, and Holland America reduced its
charitable donations. And while this cutback has prompted many in
Alaska to label the industry arrogant, it has spurred merchants to
fight future efforts at restricting tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ship passengers spend more than $160 million a year in
southeast Alaska, according to Alaskan tourism officials and
studies sponsored by the industry. To towns like Ketchikan and
Sitka, which saw their big timber-processing mills close in recent
years, the cruise ships are the key to prosperity. Cruise industry
officials say they oppose head taxes, because they already pay in
excess of $10 million a year in local sales tax and fees.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong for the industry to ignore or dismiss
complaints from the towns most affected by heavy growth, said Fay,
the Alaska tourism director. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of these residents as the canaries in the coal
mine, the fact that they are complaining is a good indication that
visitors may soon start complaining,'' she said. ``The message from
Juneau was: `I'm trying to tell you something.' And I'm not sure
the response of the industry was as constructive as it could have
been because it has not calmed down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another concern is that the growth of large-scale tourism will
come at the expense of not just individual communities but also of
Alaska's largely pristine environment, and the many small outfits
who cater to the growing eco-tourism market.
</P>
<P>
   These critics point to the dumping of toxic waste water by Royal
Caribbean Cruise Lines during the mid-1990s, and recent citations
of other lines for violating air pollution levels. Royal Caribbean
agreed to pay $6.5 million in criminal fines _ a record for a
cruise ship operator in U.S. waters _ for the discharges at sea.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The industry promotes itself as environmentally clean, and says
it processes solid waste on board and then disposes of it ashore.
The water used in showers, dishwashing and laundry is still dumped
at sea, but cruise ship operators say it is harmless and in
compliance with federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Torok, the Environmental Protection Agency's senior
representative in Juneau, and Capt. Ed Page, chief of marine safety
for the Coast Guard in Alaska, said the only regulations for this
so-called gray water is that it comprise solely waste water from
showers, food preparation and laundry. Yet there have been
violations over the years, they added, because hazardous materials
were mixed with the waste water and dumped. As a result, Page said,
spot-testing of such water began this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond pollution concerns, some critics say Alaska's wild lands
and formerly empty fiords and inlets have simply become too
crowded. Twenty years ago, President Carter more than doubled the
size of the national park and wildlife refuge systems in the state.
The move outraged members of Alaska's congressional delegation, who
said the new parks and refuges would not attract sufficient
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have people flocked to these federally protected lands,
but Alaska's powerful representatives in Congress have become the
biggest promoters of the expanded tourism industry that has
resulted. In the mid-90s, the delegation pushed through a change in
the law allowing cruise ship traffic to nearly double _ to 184 _ in
June, July and August in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve,
the nation's largest protected marine ecosystem. A compromise
eventually set the limit at 139.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen have also promoted plans to build a 90-mile road
through the wilderness of Denali National Park, and have quashed
efforts to limit visitors around the falls where brown bears gather
to eat salmon in Katmai National Park. Sens. Frank Murkowski and
Ted Stevens, R-Ala., say Denali needs more development and Katmai
can accommodate more visitors without affecting the behavior of the
big bears.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Chip Dennerlein, director of the Alaska office of
the National Parks Conservation Association, which is opposed to
many of the new development plans in or near Alaska's parks,
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come all the way to Alaska to experience the wild,'' he
said, ``and what you see is a free-for-all to watch bears, or you
go to pristine camp site and there are 35 helicopter flights over
your head, that's going to give you second thoughts.''

WILL THE REAL AL GORE PLEASE STAND UP? &HT;    By MARIANNE MEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore's father once told a
reporter that his son was so nervous when he announced his
candidacy for Congress in 1976 that he hastily fled afterward to a
bathroom to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the cool, distant, disciplined Al Gore who has been
at President Clinton's side the past eight years. The Gore the
public sees is something like the new J. Paul Getty Museum in the
Santa Monica Mountains near here _ all sharp angles, hard rock and
steel, handsome, efficient and impressive, but not warm and cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   The upchuck episode happened a quarter century ago, when Gore
was very much a novice at the political game he would gradually
come to master.
</P>
<P>
   But just who is the real Al Gore these days? Most voters
indicate that despite his long-running national role, they don't
have a sense of his inner self and find his public personality
stiff and unfriendly. He suffers by comparison with Clinton, the
Democrats' best people-pleaser, and with Gov. George W. Bush, whose
shirt-sleeve approach to issues is widely appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention gives Gore his greatest
opportunity to let the nation get to know him. It is his last
chance for prolonged massive exposure until the debates with Bush
in October, by which time his image may be frozen and incapable of
change.
</P>
<P>
   He fully recognizes the importance of this moment. ``I don't
think I'm well-known as a person and as a presidential candidate,''
he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions stick. And for many voters this will be the
first impression they will have of Gore the man, speaking by
himself, of himself, for himself. They may aleady have heard he's a
serious fellow, but will they like him?
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem is similar to that of another vice president a
dozen years ago, who was also forced to confront doubts about his
personality and leadership ability when he sought to move up to the
presidency. That 1988 candidate was the current Republican
nominee's father, George H. W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He had labored silently for eight years in the shadow of a
popular president, much as Gore has, and he was not seen as a
strong, independent figure capable of carrying on in the grand
tradition of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. To some extent, every
vice president suffers from this second-banana syndrome. The
Democrats had a jolly good time chanting ``Where was George?'' at
their own convention that year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the elder solved his problem by taking a substantial share
of the credit for the peace and prosperity of the Reagan years and
promising even better times to come. He delivered a more forceful
acceptance speech than many delegates had expected, attacking
Democrats as dangerously liberal, vowing to run hard and fight hard
and thundering, ``I am that man'' who could lead the GOP to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   His speech was a tremendous hit with the conservative delegates,
and it wrapped him in the aura of leadership that had been missing,
although his reckless pledge of ``no new taxes'' would later come
back to haunt him. Bush then went on to wage a relentlessly
negative campaign, smearing his rival Michael Dukakis as
unpatriotic and weak. It worked and Bush won.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush formula sets an appropriate example for Gore to follow.
Gore should ignore advisers who demand that he condemn Clinton for
the Monica Lewinsky affair. After all, the younger Bush failed to
mention the last big scandal of the Reagan administration, the
Iran-contra affair. This is the time for Gore to be positive, to
look forward rather than back and to stamp his own identity upon
his party.
</P>
<P>
   It is also time to stop the silly pretense that he will never
again say ``a single unkind word'' about his rival. A presidential
candidate who does not counter the charges of his opposition is a
loser. But Gore is concerned that he has gained a reputation as an
attack dog, which voters tell the pollsters they do not like. So he
has been trying to show a kinder face. The other day he vowed that
in his acceptance speech ``there will be no negative points about
Governor Bush or Mr. Cheney, either overt or covert, either direct
or implied.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats can only hope that this pledge does not apply to the
rest of the campaign once his speech is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans keep saying they won't go negative, either, but
of course they have. Their convention was loaded with snide remarks
about the need to ``uphold the honor and dignity'' of the White
House supposedly lost by the behavior of the Democrats. George W.
Bush said, ``This administration for seven years has squandered the
political capital of the previous administration'', that of _ guess
who? _ his father, who presided over huge national deficits and a
recession. And Bush tried to bait Gore by noting,``Either you're
part of an administration or you're not part of an administration.
If Al Gore has differences with the president, he ought to say loud
and clear what they are.'' Actually, Gore has already pointed out
many differences, including his dismay at Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky. Bush just hasn't been listening.
</P>
<P>
   It is incumbent upon Gore to answer this garbage. His running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, can do some of it, but ultimately only
the presidential candidate carries the clout to make his case to
the public. In politics, politeness is often mistaken for weakness.
This is Gore's time to show us his muscle. If Bush the elder could
do it, so can Gore.

 &HT;    PRO-BUSH TEXAS DEMOCRATS TEE OFF ON GORE
 &HT;    Attn: Texas pointsBy KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was supposed to be four days of Democratic
peace, love and understanding. Then the Texans showed up.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more discordant notes on the opening day of the
Democratic National Convention, Texans loyal to Al Gore, who will
get the party's presidential nomination here this week, clashed
with Texans who have crossed party lines to back GOP nominee George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It made for some harsh words among folks usually on the same
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really just think it's outrageous how the Gore campaign has
tried to trash Texas,'' said former Texas Supreme Court Chief
Justice John Hill, a Bush supporter. ``That's very offensive to me
and I think to just about everyone, Democrat and Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Bush Democrats, none of whom are convention delegates,
did their show Monday at a Republican Party office across the
street from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand why the Democratic Party is trying to
trash one of the states of our union,'' House Appropriations
Chairman Rob Junell, a San Angelo Democrat backing Bush for
president, said about Gore's attack on the Texas record on
education, the environment and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Junell, here on the Bush campaign's tab, said he made the trip
so he could discuss ``the wonderful job Governor Bush has done in
the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like Washington, D.C., if you like partisan gridlock,
if you like talking to one another through press conferences as
opposed to sitting down and trying to reach consensus ... then you
shouldn't vote for Governor Bush. You ought to go vote for the guy
across the street,'' he said, referring to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a former state attorney general who was the Democrats'
unsuccessful 1978 gubernatorial candidate, said Bush has ``done a
marvelous job'' as governor. Bush appointed Hill to the Texas
Lottery Commission, a post he no longer holds.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hill and Junell, state Sen. Ken Armbrister of Victoria and
Sandy Kress of Austin, who represents educational interests, said
they were asked to come out here by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It behooves me to try to understand why my party thinks the
way that you elect somebody to the highest office in the land is to
identify one state out of 50'' and attack it, said Armbrister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed when it is my party saying these things about
my great state,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston, a Gore backer posted outside
the office building where the Bush backers held their event, said
there is nothing non-Texan about pointing out the state's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the problem-solvers in the Texas Legislature, not the
people who try to sweep those problems under the rug,'' said
Coleman, who was joined outside the Republican Party office by Rep.
Scott Hochberg of Houston and Sen. Mario Gallegos of Galena Park.

GORE SPEAKS IN TRUMAN'S HOMETOWN 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editors please note: A longer version will move later.)
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ Al Gore came to Harry Truman's adopted
hometown Monday to claim the mantle as defender of senior citizens
and Medicare, the health-care program that Truman championed half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told a crowd of several hundred mostly senior citizens that
if elected president, he would use the nation's projected budget
surpluses to expand the Medicare program to cover prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to strengthen Social Security, to improve benefits
for long-term care for seniors and to establish full health
insurance for all children within the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need step by step to get to Truman's goal of universal
health care coverage,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance was part of a weeklong campaign swing leading
up to his nomination Wednesday at the Democratic National
Convention. He has talked about tax cuts to spur economic
development in Connecticut, children's health care in Cleveland and
cleaning up the environment in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He chose senior issues for Monday's forum because President
Johnson came to Independence 35 years ago to sign into law the
legislation that created the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Before the law, about half of the nation's elderly had health
insurance, Gore said. After the law, 95 percent were covered.

CAMPING IN ALASKA: JUST ROUGH ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 By MATT NESVISKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm uncomfortable around animals that stand taller than I do and
can eat me. I don't water-ski and I don't enjoy riding in tiny
airplanes that do. I'm wary of icy sidewalks, so the thought of
having lunch on a mountain of ice 1,000 feet thick tends to chill
my appetite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, Alaska is the kind of place that intimidates me.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet a camping trip to Alaska last summer _ including excursions
on seaplanes, encounters with wildlife, even a picnic atop a
glacier _ turned out to be an excellent way for a first-time
visitor to experience in two weeks a good helping of this
preposterously huge and nearly roadless state. And a local touring
outfit called CampAlaska was up to the logistical task, providing
an invaluable driver-guide, good food, transportation and all
camping equipment besides personal gear and sleeping bags.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our 14-day Sourdough package took my wife and me to some of
Alaska's loveliest and most memorable sites: Denali National Park,
where we rafted down a glacial river; the little-visited
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, with its fields of
summer wildflowers; and Childs Glacier on the salmon-rich Copper
River. In between our wilderness adventures, we visited Seward,
Valdez, Cordova and other Alaskan towns.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mixed lot that assembled for various itineraries Sunday
morning at our hotel near Anchorage International Airport, in
couples and singles, ranging from their late 20s to their late 50s.
From throughout the United States and from Germany, Japan and
India, all had done some camping and hiking, but most were visiting
Alaska for the first time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our personable, knowledgeable guide was Bill Dyke, at 32 a
veteran member of the 15-year-old CampAlaska company. After a trip
to Anchorage's largest supermarket for last-minute perishables, our
group of five headed south in a 12-passenger van on the Seward
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the 108-mile route we stopped at Beluga Point, where
we failed to see any of the whales that purportedly frolic in the
Turnagain Arm of the Cook Inlet. We also passed through no fewer
than three locations called Moose Pass _ but at each one, the moose
apparently had already passed. Later Bill excitedly braked at the
foot of a high slope of the Chugach National Forest to point out
tiny white specks he claimed were dall sheep. Through my binoculars
the tiny white specks appeared only as larger white specks. I felt
fated to be the first visitor to Alaska to encounter no wildlife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I certainly had no complaints when we stopped near Seward for
our first hike along a level, three-mile trail. Here in the Kenai
Fjords National Park we came within 20 yards of the startlingly
blue, 150-foot-high Exit Glacier, part of the great Harding
Icefield.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We didn't linger long in Seward, a not-especially-attractive
fishing and ferry port at the head of Resurrection Bay on the Kenai
Peninsula. Seward was largely destroyed by a tsunami caused by the
1964 Alaska earthquake. Nothing in Seward commanded attention as
much as the surrounding mountains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We set up for our first night's camping at Miller's Landing, on
the bay two miles south of town. The site offered few amenities,
but the choice was felicitous for its thick and fragrant spruce
forest and for the bald eagles that favor the area. After patiently
instructing his tenderfoot charges in assembling the company's
two-person tents, Bill prepared our dinner of fresh halibut with
pesto baked in a Dutch oven and salad (wine was provided by
individual campers), we cheerfully made the coffee and did KP; Bill
usually refused help with the cooking itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite this happy picture, camping in Alaska has its downside.
One is rain; parts of Alaska record annual precipitation in feet,
not inches. Fortunately, only twice during our two weeks did it
rain, and never enough to interfere with our activities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more certain camping discomfort is mosquitoes; like everything
else in the state, the mosquitoes we encountered were oversize, if
lethargic. We were never entirely free of them, but only once _ on
the Copper River delta _ were we forced to don head nets at our
campsite.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A third irritant is the perpetual summer daylight. While the
constant light allows for nonstop sightseeing, it largely obviates
one of camping's great pleasures, the campfire. We dutifully built
a fire every night, but darkness never arrived to justify it. Most
nights remained light enough for reading inside the tents.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, I was up hours before what would have been sunrise
had the sun ever set. After a breakfast of cold cereal, pancakes,
fresh fruit and coffee, we campers had a choice of activities out
of Seward, and my wife and I chose the seven-and-a-half-hour cruise
and salmon bake with Kenai Fjords Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy seas prevented the boat from venturing into other inlets
of the Kenai Fjords National Park. But we did sail for four hours,
and the tour operators cheerfully refunded all passengers a third
of their fares. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the salmon bake on Fox Island, we thrilled to the thickly
forested mountainsides of the bay, still spattered with snow in
midsummer. And we saw abundant wildlife, including puffins, Steller
sea lions and _ most spectacularly _ a humpback whale, which we
could photograph at close range for nearly an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in camp for supper, Bill treated us to two-inch-thick
steaks, baked potatoes, salad and apple crumble baked in the Dutch
oven. In the long light of evening we were able to observe the
eagles, stroll the beach, or sit in the campsite office where we
could sample pickled halibut from an iron pot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heading north of Seward the next day, we stopped at the Portage
Glacier Recreation Area in the Chugach National Forest. The
glacier, which lurks behind an ice-filled lake, is one of the most
popular tourist sites in Alaska. By noon we were having a tailgate
lunch as our van stood in line for loading onto a train from
Portage to Whittier, which is one fjord over the mountains.
Passengers stayed in their vehicles, which were carried on flatbed
railway cars through funhouse mountain tunnels _ the only darkness
we would experience in two weeks. (Vehicles can now make the trip
through the tunnels without using the train.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Whittier, where all 300 residents live in one huge apartment
building, Bill drove the van into the belly of a Marine Highway
System ferry, and for the rest of the day we relaxed topside,
photographing the 35-mile-wide Columbia Glacier as icebergs drifted
by.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We debarked at the port of Valdez, historically one of the major
gateways to Alaska's gold fields and today the shipping terminus of
the 800-mile Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. After setting up the tents
on the edge of town at the Eagle's Rest campground, we ventured
into one of the numerous waterfront saloons. This was the sort of
place that featured wailing country music, Harley-Davidson devotees
at the pool table, and a poster that read: ``Earth First! We'll Log
the Other Planets Later.'' From what I can recall, a good time was
had by all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day was devoted to hiking the mountains and admiring
the Bridal Veil Falls in nearby Keystone Canyon. The following
morning we drove to Robe Lake, seven miles out of town, and flew in
a float plane over stunning mountains, lakes and fjords to the port
of Cordova, where another CampAlaska van met us. We were delighted
that Bill, our guide, remained with us for this leg.
</P>
<P>
   Inaccessible by road, Cordova is less visited (and much more
charming) than either Seward or Valdez. One largely unpaved road,
the grandly named Copper River Highway, does lead out of town, but
after 48 miles it abruptly terminates in the wilderness. We took
that road because it is widely considered the most beautiful drive
in Alaska, skirting a half-dozen glaciers, the most spectacular of
which is Childs Glacier. Here even Cordovans turn up with their
lawn chairs to watch the calving, in which Wal-Mart-size slabs of
ice crack off the glacier and explode into the silty but
salmon-rich Copper River, causing sizable waves.
</P>
<P>
   It was along this road, too, that we saw our first beavers,
moose, trumpeter swans, willow ptarmigans (the quail-like Alaskan
state bird). And a black bear bounded across the road right in
front of the van. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a second day's hiking, we boarded a plane at the minuscule
Merle K. (Mudhole) Smith Airport in Cordova for a one-hour flight
to Anchorage. Rejuvenated by a night in hotel beds, we rose the
next morning for the second half of the camping trip. Now we headed
north 235 miles to see Mount McKinley, at 20,320 feet North
America's highest peak, and to spend three days at Denali National
Park and Preserve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 6 million acres, Denali has almost as much land as
Massachusetts. The group _ we numbered 10 this time _ camped at the
nearby Grizzly Bear campsite, which proved aptly named: During our
stay we saw at least a half dozen grizzlies. The bears were usually
at a distance of a quarter-mile, encounters quite close enough for
me. Caribou, however, ambled right across our path.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I later spent two hours on a white-water rafting
trip ($55), offered by the Denali Outdoor Center, through a canyon
on the glacial Nenana River, which disorientingly runs south to
north. Shooting through Class III and IV rapids (on a scale of I to
VI, with the latter being unnegotiable), with such endearing names
as Train Wreck, Razorback, Royal Flush and Ice Worm, this novice
paddler was hurled once into the center of the raft, but not into
the 45-degree water. Our reward at dinner was Bill's Alaskan king
crab legs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as Denali was, the highlight of the trip was our
three days at the much larger (13.2 million acres) Wrangell-St.
Elias National Park and Preserve. Six times the size of
Yellowstone, Wrangell-St. Elias is chiefly wilderness. The Wrangell
Mountain Range is snowcapped and volcanic, and Mount St. Elias
(18,008 feet) is the second highest peak in North America. Many of
the mountains in both ranges remain not only unclimbed, but
unnamed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park itself is penetrated, but only slightly, by two gravel
roads. Its ``urban center'' is McCarthy, which has a year-round
population of about 30 and is reachable only by air or by a
footbridge across the furious Kennicott River. We left the van at
the footbridge and carried personal gear across for two nights at
the rustic McCarthy Lodge. The remains of the town, which earlier
this century entertained hundreds of miners from the adjacent
copper mine with saloons and brothels, have a discarded and forlorn
air. Melancholy, too, is the 14-story Kennicott mine and mill,
which was abruptly shut just before World War II. But our hikes in
the spruce and birch forests, full of alpine aster, lupine, berry
shrubs and fireweed, were exhilarating, as was a four-hour glacier
walk led by St. Elias Alpine Guides, which is headed by Bob Jacobs,
a veteran of Everest and polar expeditions. While on the glacier we
came across a moulin _ a corkscrew opening in the translucent blue
ice _ carved by a melting water channel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One last night on our way back to Anchorage was devoted to
tenting at Lake Louise, where we spotted a solitary loon on the
placid water. As I saw how adept we were at setting up our tents, I
realized I had become a happy Alaskan camper. &QL;

ADVERTISING: FRENCH AD BUSINESS ENJOYING CAFE LIFE _ AND
PROFITING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PFANNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Siemens, the German electronics giant, has reserved
8,000 of the choicest tables in France this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Foie gras and fine wines, however, are not on the menu. Siemens
is more interested in consumer eyeballs. It is using the tables _
modified versions of the ubiquitous Parisian bistro table _ to
display advertisements for a new line of cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get very original promotions where our
competitors are not,'' said Christine Blanc Montmayeur, a
spokeswoman for Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   Risking the wrath of a society that takes its cafes very
seriously, a French startup company introduced the advertising
medium this spring, altering the traditional small, round French
cafe table to put marketing on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Impact Diffusion, was formed last year by two
entrepreneurs, Akim Rezgui and Jacques Delavault, with 20 million
francs, about $3 million, in backing from a private investor.
Rezgui and Delavault developed a new tabletop, adding a
snare-drum-like enclosure. Underneath a glass cover, there is room
for a three-dimensional display.
</P>
<P>
   Since spring, Impact Diffusion has run campaigns for everything
from beer companies to florists to Internet service providers.
Impact Diffusion charges 750,000 francs, or just over $100,000, to
rent out the network of tables for two weeks. Out of that revenue,
Impact said it pays cafe and nightclub owners a fee based on the
size and locations of their businesses, but declined to be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corp., used the tabletop
advertising to introduce a nonstop route linking Paris and Los
Angeles. The advertisement showed a paper-cutout plane making its
way down a runway paved with the stars of the Hollywood Walk of
Fame. ``Because United Airlines was one of the first, that gave it
extra visibility,'' said Geoffroy Epron, a media consultant at
Young &AMP; Rubicam, which handles United's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the advertisements _ including one for Max, a young
men's magazine with covers that feature barely covered models, and
one for a brand of cigarette-rolling paper _ appear only in tables
placed in nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, whose campaign started July 29 and is scheduled to run
through the end of August, is trying to take the medium a step
further, giving it an interactive element. Customers seated at the
tables are supposed to get coasters with their drinks that work in
conjunction with the advertisements. The coasters include a
mini-quiz; clues to the answers are provided on the tabletops.
Customers also can mail in their coasters to participate in a
lottery for prizes varying from vacations in Spain to wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good to entertain the customer when he is very
relaxed,'' Blanc Montmayeur explained.
</P>
<P>
   Parisian waiters appear to be approaching the game with the same
relaxed nonchalance they sometimes employ when asked for the check.
At a cafe in the Latin Quarter, the waiter simply shrugged when
asked recently why the coaster was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Parisians, however, are anything but relaxed.
Globalization, and the host of evils attributed to it, have been a
hot topic here. Jose Bove, a sheep farmer turned anticorporate
crusader who is accused of trashing a McDonald's restaurant in the
south of France, has become something of a celebrity. Is Impact
Diffusion the cutting edge of a further commercial incursion?
</P>
<P>
   ``What a horror,'' said Camille Mouries, a librarian at the
National Audiovisual Institute, pointing to the colorful Siemens
advertisement with a mobile phone protruding prominently under the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a store closes in Paris, it is replaced by one
selling portable phones,'' she said, adding that the profusion of
marketing for digital gadgets in Paris made her uneasy. ``It's
everywhere. That and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Delavault argued that France is changing; market research showed
that 70 percent of people liked the new advertising format. And
advertising is not new to French cafes: Logo-laden umbrellas,
ashtrays and other promotional materials have long been a part of
the scene, though the Impact enterprise is the first to sell
advertising space to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Delavault said, the tabletop advertisements are far
less intrusive than other forms of outdoor advertising, like
billboards. ``We have the chance to show advertisements in the
heart of the city without destroying the environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, added Delavault, the advertisements serve a useful
purpose in a country where whiling away spare time in a cafe is
part social ritual, part therapy. ``When I'm all alone, I can look
at that, not at my neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business is going well, Rezgui said, though he would not provide
figures on sales or profitability. In June, he said, Impact
Diffusion even had to turn away potential advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the six-person company, which built its advertising
network by going door-to-door to approach cafe owners, has placed
its tables in more than 50 cafes and nightclubs in 14 cities across
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 62,000 cafes in France,'' Rezgui said. ``That gives
us a great opportunity.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Monday, intense thunderstorms developed over northern Minnesota
as a jet stream disturbance passed over the upper Middle West.
Tuesday, a stronger disturbance escorting a cold front across the
eastern Great Lakes region will pose a greater threat.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms, a few capable of spawning severe
weather, will erupt over Michigan and parts of Ohio and move into
western New York and western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Beryl, which intensified suddenly Monday
southeast of Brownsville, Texas, may become a hurricane and brush
the south Texas Coast Tuesday. Squally thunderstorms in the outer
bands of Beryl could produce tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will affect New England as a
sluggish upper-level low pivots northeastward.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: A TOUCH OF AUTUMN
</P>
<P>
   A dry air mass reminiscent of midautumn soothed the
traditionally sultry Deep South and Gulf States on Sunday. The
refreshing, autumnlike humidity did not come from Canada. Instead,
the dry air originated several thousand feet above the surface.
During the day, heating of the ground incited rising currents of
hot air. In compensation, air subsided, transporting drier air
toward the ground. Sunday's autumnlike dryness was short-lived,
however. By Monday morning, the amount of water vapor in the air
over Houston had nearly doubled from Sunday afternoon.

RESEARCHERS TURN BONE MARROW CELLS INTO NERVE CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Ill., Mass.)   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have spurred bone marrow cells to turn into nerve
cells, raising the tantalizing possibility of an easily accessible
source of replacement cells to treat brain and nerve injuries and
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But the work is just beginning, experts say, and it remains to
be seen whether the newly created nerve cells can correct such
things as spinal cord injuries or brain diseases like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's, even in animals.
</P>
<P>
   The research is described in an article in the current issue of
the Journal of Neuroscience Research. The lead author, Dr. Ira
Black, is a professor and the chairman of the neuroscience and cell
biology department at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in
Piscataway, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   Black said he began the research with the thought of studying
how the body's cells, each of which has the same set of genes,
determine whether they will become blood cells, brain cells, liver
cells and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other researchers, he wondered what signaled a cell to
become one type or another. And he wanted to know how easy it was
to redirect cells to develop into the type needed. The research is
a new field with potentially revolutionary implications, including
the possibility of correcting even the most intractable health
problems with cell replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exciting thing is the idea that the adult body has cells
in it that can divide and differentiate and can potentially be used
for cellular replacement,'' said Dr. Fred Gage, a neurobiologist at
the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In Black's study, the investigators removed cells from the bone
marrow of rats _ and of humans _ that normally would develop into
tendon, cartilage, bone, muscle and fat, and grew them in the
laboratory in shallow dishes. Then they added an antioxidant, beta
mercaptoethanol, which Black had discovered in his previous work,
seemed to be a sort of biological double negative. It appeared to
block chemicals that prevent cells from becoming nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course literally of minutes, the cells converted from
rather pedestrian, flat, undistinguished stem cells into absolutely
typical neuron-looking cells,'' Black said, explaining that they
looked like bright spheres surrounded by halos. Then the cells
began growing long fibrous extensions, just like nerve cells. ``We
were disbelieving,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   As the cells continued to change their type, they matured into
cells that appeared, by all the chemical tests that Black applied,
to be nerve cells. By tinkering with the chemical signals he used
to stimulate the conversion, Black and his colleagues were able to
turn 80 percent of the bone marrow cells into nerve cells. He said
he transplanted the rat nerve cells to the brains and spinal cords
of rats and found that they survive, for months so far.
</P>
<P>
   Other neurobiologists said they were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really beautiful,'' said Dr. William Greenough, a
neuroscientist at the Beckman Institute for Advance Science and
Technology of the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. While
many researchers are working with tissue from embryos or with
animal cells to develop replacement cells for the human body, and
others are trying to redirect mature cells from other body organs
to become replacement cells, Black's approach has some potential
advantages: Bone marrow cells are easy to obtain and they could
theoretically be obtained from the very patient to be treated,
obviating the problem of adding foreign tissue that the immune
system could attack. ``I see this as a truly significant step along
the way toward developing new technologies for the repair of the
damaged brain,'' Greenough said.
</P>
<P>
   But experts emphasized the huge amount of work that has yet to
be done. Dr. Evan Y. Snyder, a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical
School, said that it remained to be seen whether cells that looked
and acted like nerve cells when they were grown in a dish in a
laboratory would look and act like nerve cells when they were
transplanted into the body. ``The level of proof is going to be
incredibly high,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. J. William Langston, who is president of The Parkinson's
Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that while he was excited by
the possibility of creating brain cells from bone marrow, he
wondered if the new cells would be specific enough to treat a
disease like Parkinson's. With that disease, Langston said,
patients need not just nerve cells but brain cells that will make
the nerve chemical dopamine. They also need cells that would remain
brain cells and not revert to fat cells or bone cells, he added.
And, he said, it is important that the transplanted cells not
overproduce dopamine. ``If those cells make too much dopamine, you
could throw the patient into overdrive,'' he said. ``How do you
make sure that they make the right amount?''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Greenough said, ``the important thing to realize
is that going from basic science to effective clinical treatment is
a pathway that invariably has many steps.''

 NEW MICHELIN SERIES HEADS IN ALL DIRECTIONS; DORIS DUKE'S SUMMER
PLACE OPENS FOR TOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michelin has come up with a new recipe for a series of
guidebooks: To an exotic destination add one part Red (as in the
Red Guide listings of recommended hotels and restaurants) and one
part Green (descriptions of places of major and minor interest),
then fold in a generous helping of practical information and
vignettes about the local culture.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a series called NEOS, with volumes about Tunisia;
Guatemala and Belize; Reunion, Mauritius and the Seychelles; Syria
and Jordan, and Turkey. Due in December are guides to Indonesia,
Rajasthan, and Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
   The name NEOS is drawn from the four compass points in French _
Nord, Est, Ouest, Sud.

   Doris Duke's Summer Place Opens for Tours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rough Point, the Newport, R.I., summer ``cottage'' of the
tobacco heiress Doris Duke, has opened to the public for the first
time. But the owners, the Newport Restoration Foundation,
established by Duke in 1968, are restricting visits to three
24-person tours a day, Tuesday to Saturday, through Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The 1889 granite mansion takes its name from a jagged promontory
on the famous Cliff Walk in Newport. Its original owner was
Frederick W. Vanderbilt, grandson of Commodore Cornelius
Vanderbilt. The architects were Peabody &AMP; Stearns; Frederick Law
Olmsted landscaped the 10-acre grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The English Manorial style house was purchased in 1922 by James
Buchanan Duke and his wife, Nanaline. Horace Trumbauer, a
Philadelphia architect, enlarged it to its present 30,000 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was an ardent art collector, a passion shared by his only
child, Doris. The tours allow viewers time to admire the art and
antiques in all the main parts of the roughly 70-room mansion.
Furnishings from France, England, Italy, Spain and China fill the
drawing, music, morning and dining rooms, and the solarium on the
first floor. On the second floor is Duke's room, with its
mother-of-pearl bedroom set. Nearby is the Pine Room, where she
practiced the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Ming Dynasty garden seats and jars are seen throughout the house
as are many paintings, mostly portraits, by Renoir, Van Dyck,
Reynolds, Gainsborough, Bol and others. In the Great Hall, with its
circa 1510 Brussels tapestries and English paneling, flags hang
from staffs above, creating a baronial effect.
</P>
<P>
   The grand staircase is lighted by large windows on the landing
that are decorated with stained-glass coats of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for Rough Point must be bought the day of the tour at
the Gateway Center, 23 America's Cup Ave., (401) 845-9130. The
office opens at 9 a.m. and the tours are at 10 a.m. and 12:30 and 3
p.m. Admission is $25; $22 for ages 65 and up and 3 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Parking, which costs $1.75 an hour or $10 a day, is available at
the center; no cars are allowed at the house. A free shuttle bus
takes visitors to and from Rough Point. The first floor is
wheelchair accessible.

RENTING IN CRETE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE STICKNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q.  &UR; Next spring my family and I would like to rent a house on
Crete, but I am having difficulty finding information. Do you have
any suggestions? _ Anne Zachos, Manchester, N.H. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Spring is usually a wonderful time to visit Crete, with fewer
crowds and typically glorious weather. You should have no problem
finding accommodations, with prices often 20 percent to 40 percent
lower than in high season, according to one agent who rents houses
there.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, director of Villas International in San Rafael,
Calif., in business for 21 years, says his company works with three
or four agents on Crete and concentrates on two main areas of the
island: Canea, also known as Chania or Hania, at the foot of the
White Mountains west of Iraklion, the capital, and Agios Nikolaos,
to the east. Accommodations include everything from simple studios
to five- or six-bedroom villas, a few on the water, some with
private pools.
</P>
<P>
   In Canea, a good base for hiking into the Samaria Gorge or
relaxing on the sandy beaches stretching to the west, and in the
seaside town of Rethimno, 20 miles to the east, two-bedroom houses
cost $1,000 to $1,250 a week (prices quoted are rates for next
spring). At the high end, and near the resort of Agios Nikolaos at
the other end of the island, a three-bedroom house on a cliff
overlooking Mirabello Bay with a private cove starts at $3,500 a
week, depending on the number of occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Villas International also has a few properties on the southern
and eastern coasts of the island, where there are secluded beaches
and small fishing villages. Generally, a minimum stay of seven days
is required.
</P>
<P>
   For information, contact Villas International, 950 Northgate
Drive, Suite 206, San Rafael, Calif. 94903; (800) 221-2260, fax
(415) 499-9491; www.villasintl.com; e-mail info(at)villasintl.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another company offering a few rentals (it has more houses for
sale) goes by its Web site name, www.a-house-on-crete.com;
telephone and fax (30-831) 72668. A new two-bedroom house in
Roumeli, near Rethimno, with a pool and garden, a mile from the
beach, costs $500 a week (April through October). A 250-year-old
restored villa in Hamalevri, a tiny village seven miles east of
Rethimno, with three large bedrooms, two baths, a garden and sea
and mountain views, costs $800 a week. There is a 10 percent
discount for stays of more than two weeks. Mark Last, the owner,
says more houses will be available for rent by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek National Tourist Organization in New York suggests you
look at the listings of houses, villas and apartments on the Web
site of Crete Tournet, at www.crete.tournet.gr. The site includes
address, telephone and fax for each property, with descriptions of
accommodations and facilities, color photographs, location
(distance from the beach and from the nearest town) and last
renovation.
TOURING THE BALTICS
</P>
<P>
   Q.  &UR; I am interested in touring the Baltic States (Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia) and parts of Russia next May or June. Are there
any tour agencies that arrange these trips? _ L.B., Glen Head,
N.Y. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Next year will be a particularly good time to visit the
Baltics, as Latvia is celebrating its 800th anniversary. There will
be a wide range of competitions, festivals, exhibitions and special
events in Riga and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One agency handling Baltic tours, in business for 70 years, is
Uniontours, 245 Fifth Ave,, New York, N.Y. 10016, (212) 683-9500 or
(800) 451-9511; www.uniontours.com; e-mail
travel(at)uniontours.com. Exact itineraries and dates have not been
set for next spring but should be similar to this year's. Prices
would be somewhat higher, said Stephanie Horton, the president,
because accommodations will be in Radisson hotels in Vilnius, Riga
and Tallinn.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-night tour of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia that costs
about $1,695 this year would include air fare between New York and
Vilnius, Lithuania ($599 land only). Two days are spent in Vilnius
touring the modern and medieval city, followed by an afternoon
exploring the resort town of Trakai, with an excursion to a
14th-century island castle, now an art museum. In Riga, Latvia,
visitors are taken to see the magnificent 18th-century Rundale
Palace, the Old Town and its churches and cafes and the Art Nouveau
district. If you go in mid-June you will be in time for Riga's
Opera Festival, June 8 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   In Sigulda, known as the Latvian Switzerland, visitors explore a
13th-century castle and a cave covered by inscriptions dating from
the 17th century. The trip includes a drive along the Baltic coast
to the Estonian resort town of Parnu, and then on to Tallinn, with
its old fortification walls, cobblestone streets and massive
14th-century town hall. The company also offers tours of Moscow and
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Another company specializing in the Baltics is Baltic Design
Tours, 5650 Yonge St., North York, Ontario Canada M2M 4G3; (888)
226-3628 or (416) 221-9212, fax (416) 221-6789;
www.baltic-design-tours.on.ca.
</P>
<P>
   Its seven-day Baltic Panorama tour begins and ends in Helsinki
and includes Tallinn, Vilnius and Trakai, the former capital Kaunas
and its Old Town, Riga and the university town of Tartu; this year
the cost is $1,100. Prices and itineraries are not yet set for next
year. The eight-day Baltic Highlights tour includes two days in St.
Petersburg with a visit to the Hermitage ($900 this year). Prices
do not include air fare.
Trains in Tuscany
</P>
<P>
   Q.  &UR; I want to use the train as my mode of transportation for a
vacation in Tuscany from Sept. 21 to Oct. 12. Do you know how I can
buy tickets for travel to several cities (Florence to Siena to Pisa
to Lucca to Florence) before I depart the United States? _ L.P.,
Portland, Ore. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can buy train tickets through C.I.T. Rail, a division of
C.I.T. Tours, at (800) 248-7245. The company will send the tickets
by standard two-day Federal Express. Schedules and prices can be
found at the company's Web site, cit-tours.com. The cost of the
two-hour trip from Florence to Siena is $20 first class, $14 second
class; the two-hour trip from Siena to Pisa, with a change at
Empoli, is $23 and $16; the half-hour trip between Pisa and Lucca,
$12 and $9; and the hour-and-a-half leg from Lucca to Florence, $18
to $12. Trains between each city run frequently, with between 17
and 25 a day.

IRAN CRACKS DOWN ON TWO MORE REFORMIST WRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Ataollah is CQ.) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The crackdown on reformers in Iran continued over
the weekend with the detention of two writers. A popular satirist,
Ibrahim Nabavi, and a newspaper columnist, Mohammad Qoochani, were
interrogated by a hardline court and detained.
</P>
<P>
   Both men wrote for a banned daily, Asr-e Azadegan, and won
awards from their peers on Saturday in an annual press festival.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, the government has closed the
reformist newspapers that supported the moderate president,
Mohammad Khatami. Five journalists have been jailed in the last 10
days, and the last major reform newspaper, Bahar, was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The newly elected Parliament, which has a preponderance of
reformers, suffered a setback last week when Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, ordered it to drop a bill
for press reform. The bill was a centerpiece for Parliament, which
opened in late May.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was meant to counter the hardline crackdown on the
press, under which almost 25 newspapers have been closed and a
dozen journalists jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a moderate deputy judiciary chief, Hadi Marvi,
said Monday that some of the newspapers might be allowed to publish
again because there was disagreement over the closings within the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the judges believed that the interpretation of
existing law under which the newspapers had been shut down was
``not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The reformist minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Ataollah
Mohajerani, a close ally of President Khatami and the official who
has issued newspaper licenses for three years, was summoned to
court Monday to answer questions about his ministry's expenses for
cultural projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mohajerani, who is also the government spokesman, escaped a
dismissal vote last year by the previous Parliament, which was
dominated by hardliners.
</P>
<P>
   The current crackdown appears to be an attempt to slow down the
reform movement after its strong showing in the parliamentary
elections this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamid Reza Jalaipur, the publisher of five of the banned
newspapers, said the cost of closing the papers would be greater
for hardliners than for reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new era in which one cannot rule without popular
support,'' he said. ``Hardliners have lost their credibility among
the people by these radical measures. The heart of reform is the
votes of the people, which cannot be stopped by closing newspapers
and jailing journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous pressure, 161 reformist members of the 290-seat
Parliament renewed their pledge to their constituents in a
statement read on the floor on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honorable people should know that their representatives
are faithful to the oath they took to protect their rights and will
take all necessary measures to fulfill them,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It warned the opponents of reform to ``quit their attempt aimed
at disappointing people,'' and be aware that such acts would not
affect ``people's decision in pursuing reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad-Sadeq Javadihesar, the publisher of the banned daily
Tous, said the statement indicated that the reformers ``will not
give up because of such obstacles but will only change their
approach and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said: ``Reformers and the people should not
expect all plans to succeed. What matters is that the reform
movement moves forward.''

MARROW CELLS BECOME NERVE CELLS   IN LAB EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a finding that may offer hope to people with brain and spinal
injuries, researchers say they have found a way to turn bone marrow
cells into nerve cells, possibly creating a plentiful supply of
cells to repair nerve damage once thought irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be proven that the new nerve cells have all the
capabilities of normal nerve cells, or neurons, said other
researchers. There are many types of neurons that transmit
information in the body.
</P>
<P>
   However, if they do mimic ordinary neurons, bone marrow stem
cells taken from a person might be converted into nerve cells and
implanted to heal a disease in the same person, like Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's or Lou Gehrig's disease, a spinal cord injury, the
scientists are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   And the researchers are confident that they can make the nerve
cells both rapidly and efficiently, potentially bypassing the
controversy about using stem cells from days-old human embryos in
nerve cell regeneration research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were simply astounded by the rapidity of the response,''
said Dr. Ira B. Black, a neuroscientist and senior author of the
paper, ``so that even within an hour we could see it in front of
our eyes. The cells converted from a rather flat, mundane looking
appearance and rounded up into neuron-like form.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80 percent of the bone marrow cells changed into
nerve cells in the experiment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are described in an article in the Journal of
Neuroscience Research by scientists from The University of Medicine
and Dentistry of New Jersey and from Hahnemann University in
Philadelphia. The lead author is Dale Woodbury from the New Jersey
medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the researchers cultured the bone marrow cells in
dishes along with a mixture of chemicals that nudged the cells into
changing their ``fate,'' or final function. They added chemicals
including antioxidants that they hoped would resemble the chemical
environment of brain cells, and that would coax the bone marrow
cells into becoming nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   The report is one in a string of stunning findings over the past
year or two suggesting that various kinds of stem cells in the body
_ including the ``embryonic stem cells'' that form all the body's
tissues _ can be directed to become very different types of cells.
For example, blood-forming cells have changed into muscle cells,
and neural stem cells have given rise to liver cells in recent
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments that would use embryonic stem cells are problematic
because of ethical considerations: harvesting the stem cells kills
the human embryo.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the new report is encouraging because it
suggests bone marrow cells could be taken from adults to treat
their own disease, circumventing the ethical issues. And, said the
researchers, the marrow cells would be easier to obtain than
another type of repair cell that's being studied, which has to be
harvested from deep within the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The work was supported in part by the Christopher Reeve
Paralysis Foundation and in part by the National Institutes of
Health. The actor Christopher Reeve is paralyzed from a spinal cord
injury in a riding accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are most excited about the future potential this finding
holds for patients with spinal paralysis, stroke and degenerative
brain disease,'' said Black in a statement issued by the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   However, some other scientists in the young and turbulent field
of stem cell research said the claims in the report were premature.
They questioned whether the experiment really produced fully
functioning neurons, and they said that just because it could be
done in a laboratory dish didn't mean it would work in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way to go to even say that these are neurons,''
said Fred Gage, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in Southern
California. He agreed that many experiments are suggesting that
immature cells in the organs of adults can be induced to take on
different functions, but he said this can't be done reliably and
predictably yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald McKay, a molecular biologist at the National Institute of
Neurologist Diseases and Stroke, also expressed reservations
because the work had only been done in the laboratory. He said
scientists really know very little about how these dramatic
conversions take place. But, he added, ``There's all kinds of stuff
coming out in the next three to six months that will make your hair
stand on end.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ross Lee Finney III, a mathematician whose textbooks have
instructed millions of high school and college students, died Aug.
3 in Carmel Valley, Calif. A former resident of Lincoln, Mass., he
was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cancer-related illness, according to his
publisher, Addison-Wesley of Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Finney wrote many texts on the various functions of calculus,
and he wrote book chapters, articles and research papers throughout
his career. For nearly 25 years he collaborated with Dr. George B.
Thomas of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce a
highly successful text, ``Calculus and Analytic Geometry,'' which
recently went into its 10th edition.
</P>
<P>
   A third edition of his ``Calculus'' was issued by Addison-Wesley
just last year. Finney also wrote parts of a widely used calculus
text for advanced-placement programs in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Finney, a son of the composer Ross Lee Finney, was born in
Springfield, Mass., and received his undergraduate and Ph.D.
degrees at the University of Michigan in the '50s and '60s. He was
a Fulbright scholar at the Poincare Institute in Paris in the
mid-'50s and started his teaching career at Princeton in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while teaching at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign from 1966 to 1980 he developed texts and curricula
for schools in Africa for the African Mathematics Program, which
was financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   At Illinois he helped train Peace Corps volunteers for teaching
positions in Ghana and other countries, and he traveled extensively
to Africa. He also worked to improve the teaching of mathematics in
China.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at MIT from 1980 to 1990. He also served as a senior
mathematics editor and consultant at the Education Development
Center in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Finney is survived by his wife, Laura; a son and a daughter,
Nathaniel and Dorthea Finney of San Diego; and a brother, Henry
Finney of Los Alamos, N.M.

   For several days, negotiators for Verizon Communications and its
two striking unions have been locked in debate over an issue many
working Americans can surely identify with: overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by more than 85,000 telephone workers entered its
eighth day Tuesday, with an announcement that the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers would launch mobile picketing at manholes, cable
installation sites, and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA, which represents 72,000 telephone operators and
customer service employees, said the protests would continue until
the company agrees to ease mandatory retirement procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by a state waiver that will permit Verizon trucks to
travel along Massachusetts roadways for unlimited hours, the CWA
also announced plans to protest outside the Massachusetts State
House on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said the company is
trying to find a balance between the strikers' demands and the
company's need for overtime during peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that work in our call centers is tough,'' Rabe told
reporters. ``The question is `How can we address legitimate issues
of job stress and still provide the service that customers want and
deserve?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That question has resounded throughout corporate America as
employers have instituted policies designed to increase or decrease
hours according to production or consumer demand. Not surprising,
workers in health care, manufacturing, and now telecommunications
have spoken out against such policies.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 535 registered nurses walked off jobs at St. Vincent
Hospital in Worcester, Mass. after negotiations between Tenet
Health Care and their union, the Massachusetts Nurses Association,
broke down. The reason for their anger: a contract proposal
mandating overtime when patient admissions were high.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, more than 500 workers at a Coca-Cola Bottling plant in
Massachusetts walked off their jobs after voting down a contract
their labor union had approved. One of the issues on the table:
mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the United Auto Workers union settled a contract with
General Motors Corp that forced GM to close six assembly plants in
the United States and Canada. In all, 2,800 workers struck the
Warren, Mich., powertrain plant. Among other things, the union
wanted the company to hire several hundred workers to make up for
retirements and reduce overtime stress among workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mandatory overtime is one of the most important issues in
American workplaces today, especially among professional or skilled
workers,'' Tom Juravich, director of the labor center at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that work forces are being pared down to a minimum, people
are being asked to work longer and employers are using mandatory
overtime to help achieve their goals. This is what we are seeing at
Verizon.''
</P>
<P>
   While federal statistics do not document the overtime hours of
telecommunications workers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports
that the average work week of telephone workers was 42 hours in
January 2000, up from 38 in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the percentage of families in which both spouses
worked more than 40 hours per week increased from 3.6 percent in
1969 to 10.1 percent today, according to the agency's current
population survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back and look at the average number of hours worked
by middle-class couples with children in 1979, you will find that
they worked the equivalent of a part-time job and a full-time
job,'' said Eileen Appelbaum, research director at Economic Policy
Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``But between the two of them there was someone at home
half-time. That is gone, and people are feeling much more
pressured.''
</P>
<P>
   The CWA, the largest of the two striking Verizon unions, is
demanding more flexible work schedules for its members. IBEW
represents about 13,000 telephone technicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be able to refuse unreasonable amounts of
overtime, particularly when it is mandated week after week and
month after month,'' CWA representative Steve Early. ``In New
Jersey, where there is no cap on overtime, it can mean an extra 20
hours per week. In New England, we have a cap of 10 hours of
overtime per week, except in certain months when a person could be
asked to work 12 hours. Those workers want people with serious
medical or personal issues to be excluded from overtime entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   CWA also wants a guarantee that people who have had an approved
transfer to another department will be allowed to leave. Many have
been forced to stay in their old jobs because the company is short
staffed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle McCormack, a 31-year-old mother of three, joined
Verizon Communications eight years ago. Now, employed as a customer
service representative in the company's Andover facility, she says
she is constantly juggling her schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to keep your fingers crossed because you never
know until noon whether you're going to have to work the extra
hours or not,'' McCormack said. ``I've been late for picking up the
baby at daycare, late for doctor's appointments, late picking up my
husband at the train. I've had to find someone at the last minute
to pick up my son at daycare.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Verizon's Rabe said the company is doing all it can
at the bargaining table to return its striking employees to work.
``Managing overtime is linked to the ability to shift demand (for
workers) among our call centers,'' he said. ``Reducing stress is
directly linked to our ability to manage call center volume.''

POLITICS TAKES A BEATING IN COMEDY CENTRAL'S CONVENTION COVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by CVN-DAILY SHOW-CORRESPONDENTS)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TODD CAMP 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedy Central's coverage of the 2000 Republican Convention was
best summed up by Jon Stewart, the star of the network's mock news
broadcast ``The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a fake news organization and this (convention) is a fake
news event. So I think we're the only people who should be here,''
Stewart said at a news conference before the convention began.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates showed up anyway, even though the nominations were
set in stone and there was very little room left for surprises of
any sort. The only thing on display were a bunch of politicians
delivering carefully scripted speeches and lots of people in funny
hats.
</P>
<P>
   The Comedy Central response to this, for Democrats as well as
Republicans: Why not make fun of it all?
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central's ``Indecision 2000'' for the Philadelphia
Convention, dubbed by the network as ``the most important
convention coverage ... ever,'' included nightly ``live'' ``Daily
Show'' broadcasts from their digs at the University of
Pennsylvania, with five correspondents reporting from the
convention floor. There was political commentary from former
presidential candidate Bob Dole, former Clinton Cabinet member
Robert Reich and former Nixon speechwriter-turned-game-show-host
Ben Stein. There were interviews with Sen. John McCain,
congresswoman Mary Bono and ABC news anchor Peter Jennings, and a
``Nightline''-style debate on gay conservatives featuring elderly
fringe presidential candidate Charles Doty, ``space-alien
ambassador'' Jody Pendarvis and singing psychic Fran Baskerville.
``Indecision 2000'' continues Tuesday night when the ``Daily Show''
team reports from the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea, because this is my
first convention, but I gotta say, it's awful boring,'' Stewart
told Dole the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions are a lot of fun ... for delegates,'' Dole said.
``And some people watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many, but some. And more and more of those watching are
tuning in to Comedy Central's coverage as viewership declines on
the networks. The networks, in fact, are paying less attention to
the conventions than they have in years past. ABC leads the Big
Three in coverage, but it was still tiny in comparison to the cable
news presence. CNN devoted more than 100 hours to the convention
(up 25 from 1996), and led the cable ratings, followed by Fox News
Channel and MSNBC. Of course, that didn't make it any less dull.
Which is why political humor outlets like Comedy Central, HBO's
``Dennis Miller Live'' and ABC's ``Politically Incorrect With Bill
Maher'' have been able to mine comedy gold with viewers' general
disinterest in the convention process.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central seems to be making the biggest splash. The cable
channel first stepped into the political melee in 1992, when Al
Franken hosted ``State of the Union: Undressed,'' live comedic
coverage of President Bush's State of the Union Address _ only
after the network successfully pressured ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN to
provide access to the pool feed of the speech. ``Indecision '92''
followed with nightly reports from the Republican and Democratic
conventions, and an in-depth election night special. Bill Maher and
his then-Comedy Central show, ``Politically Incorrect,'' continued
the legacy in '96 with correspondents Al Franken, Arianna
Huffington and Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   And this year's coverage proves that the network is continually
sharpening its claws. To help you decide whether Comedy Central's
snarky, no-holds-barred coverage of this week's Democratic
Convention is for you, here's a look back at some of the highlights
from this year's coverage of the Republican Convention:
</P>
<P>
   Stewart kicked off the week saying, ``... delegates from the
gated communities of New York to the gated communities of
California gathered at the First Unity Center to celebrate
diversity, inclusion and the obligatory nod to American Samoa.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the opening night speeches, Stewart said, ``George W.
Bush actually introduced Colin Powell live last night from a
classroom in Ohio. Now what that tells us is that Bush is committed
to education. So much so he's willing to keep people in school till
10:30 p.m. ... in August.''
</P>
<P>
   When accused by U.S. Rep. Mary Bono of obviously being a
Democrat, Stewart replied, ``No, I'm not. Honestly, I'm just
disgusted by the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Daily Show'' version of the Bush tribute film, ``George W.
Bush: From Wealth to Riches,'' featured candid photos of the Texas
governor with a voiceover telling the story of a man who ``has
overcome an incredible lack of obstacles, but behind the successful
man of today lies a soft-luck tale of perseverance and dogged
determination to not die young.''
</P>
<P>
   The mock film also included barbs such as, ``He later put
himself through Yale after being awarded the coveted Barbara Bush
scholarship,'' and ``For five turbulent years of Vietnam he served
as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard, singlehandedly keeping
the Lone Star State free of Charlie.'' It ended with the summation,
``George W. Bush, the kind of man who has traditionally been
elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   George W., however, often took a back seat to coverage of the
inner workings of the convention itself. Bob Dole offered this
insight: ``It's so boring that even some of the protesters are
trying to get a job for the first time in their lives. We haven't
been this excited since David Eisenhower married Julie Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Black said while watching footage of Hispanic singer Jon
Secada's performance opening night, ``I assure you this is the
first time Republicans have heard Jon Secada's music when it wasn't
blaring from their gardener's truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Black on another convention favorite, Lee Greenwood's song
``Proud to Be an American'': ``Of course we all know that
`American' is code for `I'm proud to be a wealthy, white,
middle-aged Caucasian in a stupid ... hat who still thinks he's
master of the universe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In summing up, Nancy Walls offered this incisive take on what
the convention is all about for the delegates: ``Beer, plus too
much time on your hands, equals elephant balloon hats.''

<P>
   For years, tourists visiting Los Angeles have bypassed Los
Angeles itself. Or at least its core.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing excursions generally have been confined to
attractions on the outskirts of the city: Disneyland, Hollywood,
the beach, Beverly Hills, Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown district? No, thanks. It might have been the center
of commerce for the nation's second-largest city _ and presented a
pleasing skyline for those passing through at a comfortable
distance _ but there was otherwise little to recommend it. It was
grimy and about as inviting as a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, downtown has enjoyed quite a renaissance _
and it was just in time for the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to L.A. now find they don't have to stray too far from
the city's core to enjoy some excellent attractions. Are are 10
suhc downtown gems _ including just a couple of reliable chestnuts
on the fringe of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   1. Music Center
</P>
<P>
   It was Woody Allen who said that Los Angeles' sole cultural
contribution was a right turn on a red light, but on a drive up
Figueroa from the Staples Center, you'll only make one such turn en
route to this impressive complex of three performing arts venues.
(It takes up a city block bounded by Grand, First, Temple and
Hope.)
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous but elegant Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The
intimate Mark Taper Forum. The recently renovated Ahmanson Theatre.
Even if you can't free up time for one of the programs here, the
Music Center, which is situated on some of downtown's highest
ground, is still an intriguing place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, its plaza is popular with brown-baggers from
nearby skyscrapers and court buildings, and Jacques Lipchitz's
syncopated fountain, ``Peace on Earth,'' can make even a searing
August day seem a trifle cooler. Young people in particular squeal
in delight as they try to time the fountain's irregular rhythms and
dash through in its brief, teasing instances of dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Free tours are conducted of the complex, usually around midday
during the week (11:30 a.m., noon, 1 p.m.); they form at the
entrance to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a production of ``Finian's Rainbow'' fell through at
the Ahmanson, but it might be L.A.'s gain. The replacement show is
``The Dead,'' the Tony Award-winning musical based on the James
Joyce short story. It might seem odd timing _ the story is set in
Dublin at Christmastime _ but we've never taken ourselves too
seriously when it comes to culture in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   At the Taper is ``Expecting Isabel,'' a comedy about how the
decision to have a baby can throw a monkey wrench into the marriage
of 30-somethings. (Imagine that.) The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
meanwhile, will be dark this week _ the Philharmonic is busy at the
Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Museum of Contemporary Art
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are all black and white. And universally
sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Two such exhibits are running concurrently at MOCA, half a block
south of the Music Center (at 250 S. Grand Ave.). The most
compelling is surely ``The Social Scene,'' an exhibition that is in
its final week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the museum's permanent collection (but not always on
display), ``The Social Scene'' is a look at America from the 1930s
to the '70s through the lenses of nine notable photographers. It's
a frank, unblinking and often ironic gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frank focuses on small-town and rural life from the '50s
and '60s, allowing us to peer in at scenes in coffee shops, public
parks, barber shops, African-American funerals. Diane Arbus offers
fascinating character studies.
</P>
<P>
   And Garry Winogrand, once you get past his shots of young women
that border on voyeurism, provides views of subjects such as
anti-war and abortion-rights rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibit that just opened is ``John Gutmann: Culture
Shock.'' He was a Jew in Germany in the 1930s before fleeing to San
Francisco, and on display here is the photographer's documentary
work, mostly shot in America.
</P>
<P>
   3. Grand Central Market/Angels Flight
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Bunker Hill from MOCA is a downtown
treasure that dates to 1917 _ a vast public market where visitors
can celebrate cultural diversity ... with a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Your appetite is likely to be activated the instant you step
through its warehouse-like doors and begin breathing in a rich
convergence of cooking aromas. (The market is bordered by Hill,
Broadway, Third and Fourth). You'll find L.A.'s full ethnic mix at
the casual food stands here: Chinese, Salvadoran, Thai and, of
course, a generous complement of Mexican outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The food at L.A.'s suburban Mexican restaurants tends to be
toned down for the gringos, but you'll find fare here so authentic
that you might not recognize some of the featured items, you could
have trouble comprehending the English of the counter man, and
you're likely to need that extra napkin to wipe your eyes during
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lively, vibrant place, with a light dusting of sawdust on
the concrete floor, and even if you're not hungry, it's fun just to
stroll and gaze through the display windows. You'll find produce,
flowers, ice cream, booze, bread, health food, delis (they still
make luncheon loaf?), a fish market and a giant machine that cranks
out fresh tortillas at Chapalita Tortilleria.
</P>
<P>
   The place is pleasantly scruffy, but most of the food stands
seem to be displaying the county health department's highest
cleanliness rating: ``A.'' For Mexican food that shames the chains
of Southern California, you can't go wrong at Tumbras, Ana Maria,
Maria's or Roast to Go (yes, that's the actual name of the
establishment).
</P>
<P>
   To or from the market, sample another throwback to the early
1900s: the Angels Flight funicular railway, which traverses the
short but steep climb between Hill Street (catty-corner to the
market entrance) and Olive. This relic from L.A.'s past was
recently reassembled after being in storage for nearly 30 years. It
costs a whole quarter to ride it.
</P>
<P>
   4. L.A. Conservancy walking tour
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Conservancy has taken the lead in celebrating
the city's past and offers some stellar walking tours on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Its regular schedule includes an examination of L.A.'s art deco
architecture, the old movie palaces along Broadway, and the
Pershing Square landmarks. Program coordinator Annie Laskey
explained that the tours meet at the Biltmore Hotel, which will
house convention honchos, and there was fear that conditions would
be too hectic.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradbury Building, included on one of the tours, is always
worth a look, though. At 304 S. Broadway, it is a Victorian wonder
whose exotic atrium features lacy black ironwork, tiers of open
stairwells, cage elevators and polished wood, all lit naturally
through a glass ceiling. When the makers of the 1982 movie ``Blade
Runner'' needed a futuristic look for L.A. in 2020, they ventured
back in time to this place.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular tour is of Union Station. It explores the
architecture, art work and history of one of the last great railway
stations, an L.A. landmark that features 52-foot ceilings above
marble floors _ all now wasted on Amtrak. Reservations for the 10
a.m. tour are a must: (213) 623-2489.
</P>
<P>
   5. Olvera Street
</P>
<P>
   This blatantly touristy site, a few steps uphill from Union
Station, is included only because it's where it all began for this
city. In the 1700s, some Spanish soldiers pitched camp in a flood
plain and came up with a name that was probably longer than their
settlement: El Rio Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles de
Porciuncula.
</P>
<P>
   A pueblo followed, and the name was edited down so that it would
fit on campaign buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Olvera Street has been conquered by the souvenir traders,
and they don't exactly stand on tradition _ framed photos of
pro-wrestling stars are offered among the sombreros and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the buildings along the plaza date to the early
1800s _ which is old for Los Angeles. Wander through the U-shaped
Avila Adobe (circa 1818), which features wood floors, open beams
and a broad, pre-air-conditioning overhang rimming the inner patio.
Find shade beneath mature olive trees. Survey grape vines that have
overtaken lines tied overhead.
</P>
<P>
   With the imagination unleashed, you might acquire a sense of
L.A. long before it represented a fourth of California's electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Little Tokyo
</P>
<P>
   This region a few blocks south of Olvera Street was beginning to
boom when its residents were shipped off to internment camps during
World War II, but it since has made an impressive comeback, all the
more so in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Its jewel is the 8-year-old Japanese American National Museum
(369 E. 1st St.). Currently among its exhibits is ``Common Ground:
The Heart of Community,'' which addresses the issues of
assimilation for this country's first Japanese immigrants and their
American-born children. It deals frankly with wartime
incarceration, and the word ``concentration'' is subbed for
``internment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other exhibits explore the athletic participation of
Japanese-Americans, notably as an assimilation vehicle in the 1920s
and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Across First Street from the museum is the Japanese Village
Plaza, whose brick walkway features waterfalls and shady trees and
is lined with sidewalk cafes and shops. You can seek out an
acupuncture treatment. Or, at Tawa's Spa, get a shiatsu massage
(steady, Mr. President).
</P>
<P>
   7. Exposition Park
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League viewed this complex as an urban war
zone when Los Angeles was seeking an expansion team recently.
Obviously, the league's billionaires hadn't visited it recently _
at least during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The area directly north of the Coliseum is emerging as a
treasure and thrives with activity most days. Among its offerings
are the California Science Center, the Natural History Museum, an
expansive rose garden and the California African American Museum.
(The California Aerospace Museum will be added to the mix when its
refurbishment is completed.) All of this lies exactly two miles
down Figueroa from the front door of the Staples Center _ don't
walk; no one in L.A. does.
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center is free ($5 donation suggested),
although there is a charge for several rides and features, and it
is proving to be a wonderland for inquisitive kids. Hear the sounds
of human digestion (right down to the belches), feel what it's like
to be in an earthquake (at least an extremely mild one), take a
high-wire bicycle ride, observe various magic acts (shoehorned into
the theme of the building under the subtext ``The Science of
Illusion'').
</P>
<P>
   The facility also features no fewer than four IMAX movies.
</P>
<P>
   The African American Museum (also free) currently has a terrific
exhibit titled ``Rhythms of the Soul,'' which is in its final week.
It displays ancient African instruments _ lutes, bow harps, bata
drums _ while also tracing black music on this continent through
calypso, blues, ragtime, jazz, be-bop and hip-hop. Put on a set of
headphones, for example, and hear a 1933 recording of Bessie Smith
singing ``Gimme a Pigfoot.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's no fun to spend all your time indoors on a sunny,
summer day. That sprawling rose garden has bushes that were planted
72 years ago, and when the breeze is up, a stroll here is like a
visit to a perfumery.
</P>
<P>
   8. Hollywood Bowl
</P>
<P>
   This is the farthest flung of the 10 attractions, but it is an
L.A. institution that shouldn't be missed. Nothing can match a
summer night of classical or popular music in the open-air splendor
of this hillside amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rare venue that will allow you to bring in your own
food _ and even your own alcoholic drink. Up and down the rows, and
in the boxes closer to the stage, patrons sup from their picnic
baskets and sip from their bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also sneak off to the Bowl for daytime rehearsals.
They're conducted from about 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. for all
performances except Wednesday's jazz show (sound check held in the
afternoon, undoubtedly to accommodate night-owl musicians). There
is no charge to attend them.
</P>
<P>
   9. Griffith Observatory
</P>
<P>
   This represents another delightful slice of L.A.'s past, but it
also offers an unsurpassed view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was built high on a knoll in the Hollywood Hills in 1933,
long before the glare of millions of incandescent bulbs rendered it
worthless for serious astronomical study. Particularly on summer
nights, when cooler temperatures allow the city's snuggly brown
blanket to lift, the observatory provides a sweeping view from
downtown to the ocean, with Hollywood sprawling in between.
</P>
<P>
   So many lights. So many miles of streets. So many houses. So
many registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   There's no charge to look through the observatory's 12-inch
Zeiss telescope, which is usually trained on a heavenly body that
is big enough to be distinguishable through all the light
pollution. The planetarium theater, meanwhile, features nightly
shows for modest admission rates _ the current feature examines how
Earth's dinosaurs were wiped out by the globe-wide cataclysm that
followed collision with a massive asteroid or comet.
</P>
<P>
   10. Dodger game
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but many teams in major-league baseball have declared
their 1960s-era stadiums obsolete and clamored for new facilities.
Dodger Stadium, despite being built in 1962, still seems to gleam
as if it just opened.
</P>
<P>
   And after a heretical lapse a few years ago when stadium
management started (ITAL)steaming(END ITAL) the hot dogs, the air
is once again filled with the unmistakable aroma of foot-long
Dodger dogs being cooked on an open grill.
</P>
<P>
   When buying tickets, avoid the outfield bleachers. That way you
can enjoy an experience that probably contributes to the stadium's
timeless charm: Look out over the bright-green field of play,
through the palm trees beyond center field; enjoy the glow of the
setting sun on the Elysian Hills and the cool of gathering dusk.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this, who needs Disneyland? &QL;

THE LATIN LOVER LIVES, AT LEAST DURING ITALY'S NEWSLESS DOLDRUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The peak of summer, Italian-style, was reached in banner
headlines in several of Monday's leading newspapers, which rated
beach resorts by the likelihood of vacationers' having sex there.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a possible 100 points, middle-class Viareggio scored a
smoldering 98, while the jet-set island of Capri received a tepid
rating of 31. Stromboli, despite its associations with the
scandalous 1949 love affair between Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid
Bergman, rated a mere 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Eros Report, as it was quickly dubbed, was based on a public
opinion survey of 1,000 listeners conducted by an Italian radio
station, Rete 105 Network. Both the Rome-based newspaper La
Repubblica and La Stampa, a Turin daily, cited unidentified
sexologists to supply a frisson of scientific certainty to their
identical headlines: ``VIP Beaches Kill Eros.''
</P>
<P>
   The myth of the Latin lover is as enduring in Italy as it is,
well, mythical. What is more reliable is the Italian addiction to
summertime sex surveys, which fill the holiday vacuum of political
intrigue and soccer championships.
</P>
<P>
   No country is exempt from a weakness for news stories about sun
and sexuality, particularly in August. But Italy is perhaps the one
most adept at crafting bold headlines from the slimmest scientific
findings. This August, when 52 percent of Italians, a record
number, left home for a summer holiday, creativity is at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surveys are not believable, but they are perfectly
understandable,'' said Franco Ferrarotti, a sociologist at the
University of Rome. ``The Latin lover is our Loch Ness monster, a
legend that keeps cropping up to boost tourism and our self-image.
Italian pollsters have a way of confecting interesting results from
surveys that Americans do not understand. I am not saying the
results are false, exactly; they are just organized to make a
particular point.''
</P>
<P>
   The harbinger of summer arrived with the May 4 cover of the
newsmagazine L'Espresso, which carried a picture of a woman gazing,
awestruck, down the jeans of a bare-chested Italian man under the
headline: ``Males of Italy. Better than the Americans. Here is the
proof.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-page cover story was based, rather loosely, on
statistics gathered by the Health Ministry that suggested that
Italian men reported fewer instances of impotence than their
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   By July, however, alarmed newspaper headlines in Italy had drawn
the opposite conclusion about Italian machismo. A study by Pfizer,
the company that makes Viagra, suggested that 59.2 percent of
Italian men confessed to insecurity about their sexual performance,
and 42.6 admitted to sexual difficulties. ``It was a happy
surprise,'' Maria Pia Ruffilli, head of Pfizer Italia, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Deflating stories based on the Pfizer survey were quickly
eclipsed by other reports on why wives' infidelity can help their
marriages, how pasta improves sexual performance, and whether
sunglasses make Italian men even sexier.
</P>
<P>
   A full-page article on wives' infidelity in the July 26 issue of
the Roman daily Il Messaggero appeared next to a picture of a
couple embracing passionately on the beach below the headline,
``Summer Infidelity Helps the Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The story reported that 51 percent of women believed that a
lighthearted affair was healthy, so long as they did not really
fall in love. This fact turned out to be culled from an article in
the Italian edition of the German women's magazine Burda, which had
surveyed marriage counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Anna, an Italian women's magazine, published
conflicting evidence, noting that in its survey most spouses
reported having fewer opportunities to stray on vacation, when
surrounded by their families, than during the rest of the year.
This drove the Italian news agency ANSA to gravely report on the
death of the ``scapatella,'' an Italian word for ``fling.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian media outlets are not the only ones to leap to
conclusions, however. Agence France-Presse recently ran an article
reporting, ``The sex-appeal of the quintessential Latin lover is
largely determined by his sunglasses, a survey found.'' The article
gleaned a sexual charge that was missing in the original results.
Actually, the survey of 400 people, conducted in May by a Milan
cosmetics firm, Emy Heater Institute, for an international
opticians fair, suggested that famous people looked more
authoritative in sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Some 22 percent of the people surveyed said they would like to
see Prime Minister Giuliano Amato don sunglasses, and 12 percent
said they would like Pope John Paul II to wear them. Though widely
respected, neither leader is seen by Italians as a quintessential
Latin lover.

EMERY WORLDWIDE WILL SHIP LARGE PACKAGES TO POST OFFICES  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide plans to announce a partnership Tuesday with the
Postal Service to offer residential delivery service by parcel post
to manufacturers and catalog companies.
</P>
<P>
   Emery, the express freight unit of CNF Transportation, will ship
items like computers and monitors weighing up to 70 pounds from
warehouses to post offices. The items will then by delivered by
mail carriers on their regular rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will permit Emery to expand from
business-to-business delivery to the business-to-home market, said
Douglas J. Brittin, vice president for marketing and business
development. Emery will focus on electronics manufacturers, who
have been reluctant to use the post office because it requires
payment in advance. Under the partnership, Emery will bill the
manufacturers after the shipments have been delivered. Emery will
receive a discount from the service for delivering the packages
directly to post offices. Earlier this year, Emery sued the post
office, accusing it of breaching a contract for Emery to handle the
service's Priority Mail service. Brittin said the new agreement was
separate, was not a contract and did not guarantee any volume of
service. The post office has a similar deal with Airborne Express,
which uses it for lighter packages.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, tourists visiting Los Angeles have bypassed Los
Angeles itself. Or at least its core.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing excursions generally have been confined to
attractions on the outskirts of the city: Disneyland, Hollywood,
the beach, Beverly Hills, Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown district? No, thanks. It might have been the center
of commerce for the nation's second-largest city _ and presented a
pleasing skyline for those passing through at a comfortable
distance _ but there was otherwise little to recommend it. It was
grimy and about as inviting as a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, downtown has enjoyed quite a renaissance _
and it was just in time for the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to L.A. now find they don't have to stray too far from
the city's core to enjoy some excellent attractions. Are are 10
suhc downtown gems _ including just a couple of reliable chestnuts
on the fringe of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   1. Music Center
</P>
<P>
   It was Woody Allen who said that Los Angeles' sole cultural
contribution was a right turn on a red light, but on a drive up
Figueroa from the Staples Center, you'll only make one such turn en
route to this impressive complex of three performing arts venues.
(It takes up a city block bounded by Grand, First, Temple and
Hope.)
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous but elegant Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The
intimate Mark Taper Forum. The recently renovated Ahmanson Theatre.
Even if you can't free up time for one of the programs here, the
Music Center, which is situated on some of downtown's highest
ground, is still an intriguing place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, its plaza is popular with brown-baggers from
nearby skyscrapers and court buildings, and Jacques Lipchitz's
syncopated fountain, ``Peace on Earth,'' can make even a searing
August day seem a trifle cooler. Young people in particular squeal
in delight as they try to time the fountain's irregular rhythms and
dash through in its brief, teasing instances of dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Free tours are conducted of the complex, usually around midday
during the week (11:30 a.m., noon, 1 p.m.); they form at the
entrance to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a production of ``Finian's Rainbow'' fell through at
the Ahmanson, but it might be L.A.'s gain. The replacement show is
``The Dead,'' the Tony Award-winning musical based on the James
Joyce short story. It might seem odd timing _ the story is set in
Dublin at Christmastime _ but we've never taken ourselves too
seriously when it comes to culture in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   At the Taper is ``Expecting Isabel,'' a comedy about how the
decision to have a baby can throw a monkey wrench into the marriage
of 30-somethings. (Imagine that.) The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
meanwhile, will be dark this week _ the Philharmonic is busy at the
Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Museum of Contemporary Art
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are all black and white. And universally
sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Two such exhibits are running concurrently at MOCA, half a block
south of the Music Center (at 250 S. Grand Ave.). The most
compelling is surely ``The Social Scene,'' an exhibition that is in
its final week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the museum's permanent collection (but not always on
display), ``The Social Scene'' is a look at America from the 1930s
to the '70s through the lenses of nine notable photographers. It's
a frank, unblinking and often ironic gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frank focuses on small-town and rural life from the '50s
and '60s, allowing us to peer in at scenes in coffee shops, public
parks, barber shops, African-American funerals. Diane Arbus offers
fascinating character studies.
</P>
<P>
   And Garry Winogrand, once you get past his shots of young women
that border on voyeurism, provides views of subjects such as
anti-war and abortion-rights rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibit that just opened is ``John Gutmann: Culture
Shock.'' He was a Jew in Germany in the 1930s before fleeing to San
Francisco, and on display here is the photographer's documentary
work, mostly shot in America.
</P>
<P>
   3. Grand Central Market/Angels Flight
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Bunker Hill from MOCA is a downtown
treasure that dates to 1917 _ a vast public market where visitors
can celebrate cultural diversity ... with a knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Your appetite is likely to be activated the instant you step
through its warehouse-like doors and begin breathing in a rich
convergence of cooking aromas. (The market is bordered by Hill,
Broadway, Third and Fourth). You'll find L.A.'s full ethnic mix at
the casual food stands here: Chinese, Salvadoran, Thai and, of
course, a generous complement of Mexican outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The food at L.A.'s suburban Mexican restaurants tends to be
toned down for the gringos, but you'll find fare here so authentic
that you might not recognize some of the featured items, you could
have trouble comprehending the English of the counter man, and
you're likely to need that extra napkin to wipe your eyes during
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lively, vibrant place, with a light dusting of sawdust on
the concrete floor, and even if you're not hungry, it's fun just to
stroll and gaze through the display windows. You'll find produce,
flowers, ice cream, booze, bread, health food, delis (they still
make luncheon loaf?), a fish market and a giant machine that cranks
out fresh tortillas at Chapalita Tortilleria.
</P>
<P>
   The place is pleasantly scruffy, but most of the food stands
seem to be displaying the county health department's highest
cleanliness rating: ``A.'' For Mexican food that shames the chains
of Southern California, you can't go wrong at Tumbras, Ana Maria,
Maria's or Roast to Go (yes, that's the actual name of the
establishment).
</P>
<P>
   To or from the market, sample another throwback to the early
1900s: the Angels Flight funicular railway, which traverses the
short but steep climb between Hill Street (catty-corner to the
market entrance) and Olive. This relic from L.A.'s past was
recently reassembled after being in storage for nearly 30 years. It
costs a whole quarter to ride it.
</P>
<P>
   4. L.A. Conservancy walking tour
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Conservancy has taken the lead in celebrating
the city's past and offers some stellar walking tours on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Its regular schedule includes an examination of L.A.'s art deco
architecture, the old movie palaces along Broadway, and the
Pershing Square landmarks. Program coordinator Annie Laskey
explained that the tours meet at the Biltmore Hotel, which will
house convention honchos, and there was fear that conditions would
be too hectic.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradbury Building, included on one of the tours, is always
worth a look, though. At 304 S. Broadway, it is a Victorian wonder
whose exotic atrium features lacy black ironwork, tiers of open
stairwells, cage elevators and polished wood, all lit naturally
through a glass ceiling. When the makers of the 1982 movie ``Blade
Runner'' needed a futuristic look for L.A. in 2020, they ventured
back in time to this place.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular tour is of Union Station. It explores the
architecture, art work and history of one of the last great railway
stations, an L.A. landmark that features 52-foot ceilings above
marble floors _ all now wasted on Amtrak. Reservations for the 10
a.m. tour are a must: (213) 623-2489.
</P>
<P>
   5. Olvera Street
</P>
<P>
   This blatantly touristy site, a few steps uphill from Union
Station, is included only because it's where it all began for this
city. In the 1700s, some Spanish soldiers pitched camp in a flood
plain and came up with a name that was probably longer than their
settlement: El Rio Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles de
Porciuncula.
</P>
<P>
   A pueblo followed, and the name was edited down so that it would
fit on campaign buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Olvera Street has been conquered by the souvenir traders,
and they don't exactly stand on tradition _ framed photos of
pro-wrestling stars are offered among the sombreros and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the buildings along the plaza date to the early
1800s _ which is old for Los Angeles. Wander through the U-shaped
Avila Adobe (circa 1818), which features wood floors, open beams
and a broad, pre-air-conditioning overhang rimming the inner patio.
Find shade beneath mature olive trees. Survey grape vines that have
overtaken lines tied overhead.
</P>
<P>
   With the imagination unleashed, you might acquire a sense of
L.A. long before it represented a fourth of California's electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Little Tokyo
</P>
<P>
   This region a few blocks south of Olvera Street was beginning to
boom when its residents were shipped off to internment camps during
World War II, but it since has made an impressive comeback, all the
more so in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Its jewel is the 8-year-old Japanese American National Museum
(369 E. 1st St.). Currently among its exhibits is ``Common Ground:
The Heart of Community,'' which addresses the issues of
assimilation for this country's first Japanese immigrants and their
American-born children. It deals frankly with wartime
incarceration, and the word ``concentration'' is subbed for
``internment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other exhibits explore the athletic participation of
Japanese-Americans, notably as an assimilation vehicle in the 1920s
and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Across First Street from the museum is the Japanese Village
Plaza, whose brick walkway features waterfalls and shady trees and
is lined with sidewalk cafes and shops. You can seek out an
acupuncture treatment. Or, at Tawa's Spa, get a shiatsu massage
(steady, Mr. President).
</P>
<P>
   7. Exposition Park
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League viewed this complex as an urban war
zone when Los Angeles was seeking an expansion team recently.
Obviously, the league's billionaires hadn't visited it recently _
at least during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The area directly north of the Coliseum is emerging as a
treasure and thrives with activity most days. Among its offerings
are the California Science Center, the Natural History Museum, an
expansive rose garden and the California African American Museum.
(The California Aerospace Museum will be added to the mix when its
refurbishment is completed.) All of this lies exactly two miles
down Figueroa from the front door of the Staples Center _ don't
walk; no one in L.A. does.
</P>
<P>
   The California Science Center is free ($5 donation suggested),
although there is a charge for several rides and features, and it
is proving to be a wonderland for inquisitive kids. Hear the sounds
of human digestion (right down to the belches), feel what it's like
to be in an earthquake (at least an extremely mild one), take a
high-wire bicycle ride, observe various magic acts (shoehorned into
the theme of the building under the subtext ``The Science of
Illusion'').
</P>
<P>
   The facility also features no fewer than four IMAX movies.
</P>
<P>
   The African American Museum (also free) currently has a terrific
exhibit titled ``Rhythms of the Soul,'' which is in its final week.
It displays ancient African instruments _ lutes, bow harps, bata
drums _ while also tracing black music on this continent through
calypso, blues, ragtime, jazz, be-bop and hip-hop. Put on a set of
headphones, for example, and hear a 1933 recording of Bessie Smith
singing ``Gimme a Pigfoot.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's no fun to spend all your time indoors on a sunny,
summer day. That sprawling rose garden has bushes that were planted
72 years ago, and when the breeze is up, a stroll here is like a
visit to a perfumery.
</P>
<P>
   8. Hollywood Bowl
</P>
<P>
   This is the farthest flung of the 10 attractions, but it is an
L.A. institution that shouldn't be missed. Nothing can match a
summer night of classical or popular music in the open-air splendor
of this hillside amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rare venue that will allow you to bring in your own
food _ and even your own alcoholic drink. Up and down the rows, and
in the boxes closer to the stage, patrons sup from their picnic
baskets and sip from their bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can also sneak off to the Bowl for daytime rehearsals.
They're conducted from about 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. for all
performances except Wednesday's jazz show (sound check held in the
afternoon, undoubtedly to accommodate night-owl musicians). There
is no charge to attend them.
</P>
<P>
   9. Griffith Observatory
</P>
<P>
   This represents another delightful slice of L.A.'s past, but it
also offers an unsurpassed view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was built high on a knoll in the Hollywood Hills in 1933,
long before the glare of millions of incandescent bulbs rendered it
worthless for serious astronomical study. Particularly on summer
nights, when cooler temperatures allow the city's snuggly brown
blanket to lift, the observatory provides a sweeping view from
downtown to the ocean, with Hollywood sprawling in between.
</P>
<P>
   So many lights. So many miles of streets. So many houses. So
many registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   There's no charge to look through the observatory's 12-inch
Zeiss telescope, which is usually trained on a heavenly body that
is big enough to be distinguishable through all the light
pollution. The planetarium theater, meanwhile, features nightly
shows for modest admission rates _ the current feature examines how
Earth's dinosaurs were wiped out by the globe-wide cataclysm that
followed collision with a massive asteroid or comet.
</P>
<P>
   10. Dodger game
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but many teams in major-league baseball have declared
their 1960s-era stadiums obsolete and clamored for new facilities.
Dodger Stadium, despite being built in 1962, still seems to gleam
as if it just opened.
</P>
<P>
   And after a heretical lapse a few years ago when stadium
management started (ITAL)steaming(END ITAL) the hot dogs, the air
is once again filled with the unmistakable aroma of foot-long
Dodger dogs being cooked on an open grill.
</P>
<P>
   When buying tickets, avoid the outfield bleachers. That way you
can enjoy an experience that probably contributes to the stadium's
timeless charm: Look out over the bright-green field of play,
through the palm trees beyond center field; enjoy the glow of the
setting sun on the Elysian Hills and the cool of gathering dusk.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this, who needs Disneyland? &QL;

WWP GROUP REPORTS SURGE IN PROFITS AND REVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ WPP Group, which will become the world's largest
advertising firm with its acquisition of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.,
reported a surge in profits and revenue Monday and forecast that
the boom in advertising spending would last through the end of the
year, buoyed by the Olympics and the presidential elections in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts, however, said the climate for big advertising
firms like WPP is currently as good as it will get.
</P>
<P>
   WPP, based in London, said operating profit for the first six
months of the year grew 22 percent, to 146.5 million pounds ($220
million), or 12 pence a diluted share, compared with 120 million
pounds, or 9.8 pence a diluted share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 18 percent, to 1.2 billion pounds, driven by new
accounts, like SAP AG, and increased spending from existing clients
like the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Including Young &AMP; Rubicam, which WPP is buying for $4.7 billion
in stock, and excluding one-time merger costs, revenue increased 19
percent while operating profit jumped 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, said shareholders
would vote on the merger in September. Calling his company a proxy
for the new economy, Sorrell sought to counter concerns that an
expected slowdown in Internet advertising spending would dent WPP's
growth prospects. He said that online spending tripled to (PS)90
million, or about $135 million, during the first half of the year.
What has changed, he said, is who is buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big traditional companies are spending more on the new
economy, while new economy companies have had difficulties due to
stock market falls and are spending less,'' Sorrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, analysts said the currently vibrant conditions
for all types of advertising spending were unlikely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, you won't have the presidential elections or the
Olympics or anything particularly big,'' said Gareth Thomas, an
analyst with Commerzbank. ``Even if the economy stays strong, the
top line will slow. And the margin enhancements we've seen to date
won't be replicated.''
</P>
<P>
   WPP has been preparing for an eventual slowdown by paying more
of its employees on a bonus schedule and hiring more staff on
contracts. Sorrell said such flexible costs, which are equal to 7
percent of revenue, could be easily reduced in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of WPP, which owns the J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Worldwide advertising agencies along with the public
relations firm Hill &AMP; Knowlton, rose as much as 2.4 percent on the
earnings news, but fell back at the close of London trading to end
down 0.11 percent at 907 pence, or about $13.60.

BRADLEY FACES TOUGH CROWD FOR LAST HURRAH

<P>
   What Bill Bradley and his legions of supporters have wanted ever
since they realized back in March that he would not be the party's
nominee -- a chance to talk to a national audience about the issues
he considers important.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night he gets that chance. It will be Bradley's last
hurrah of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During prime time, the former New Jersey senator will offer his
support of Al Gore, the man who soundly defeated him in the Iowa
caucuses, the New Hampshire primary and 16 other contests held
March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, whose previous national convention speeches in 1988
and 1992 failed to ignite the partisan Democratic crowds, might
have a hard time getting a convention united for Gore to give him
anything but polite consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he is sharing the spotlight with a group of
speakers who may overshadow him.
</P>
<P>
   On an evening some have dubbed ``liberal night,'' Bradley will
appear onstage along with the keynoter, Tennessee Rep. Harold Ford;
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; and two of the party's best orators,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said the former senator is
looking forward to addressing the convention. And whether or not
his oratory matches the others, Hauser said, Bradley believes it is
``more important for the record than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley certainly would have preferred to be delivering
the acceptance speech Thursday night as the party's nominee, his
spokesman said he has ``no regrets'' about his campaign, is over
his disappointment and without any hesitation will reinforce the
endorsement of Gore that he finally made last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Bradley finally released his 359 delegates, freeing
them to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley will talk ``about his support for Al Gore
and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and the basis for that
support,'' said Hauser. ``He will tell why Gore will make a
significantly better president than George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Bradley surfaced after four months of political
seclusion and offered a belated and minimalist endorsement of Gore.
During a rally in Green Bay, Wis., where he was unavailable to
answer any questions, Bradley essentially told the crowd that Gore
was far preferable to Bush, the Republican presidential candidate,
and as a Democrat, he wanted to see his party win in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, Bradley used his July endorsement speech to talk
about the agenda of his unsuccessful presidential primary campaign,
including his commitment to erasing child poverty, expanding health
care coverage to everyone and enacting campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser said Bradley will talk about these issues again Tuesday,
noting that ``these challenges haven't gone away.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, an adviser to the Gore campaign in California, said
Gore is hopeful Bradley will rise to the occasion and put his stamp
of approval on the Democratic ticket ``in a way that appeals to the
voters he was aiming at in the primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore may have bashed him easily, but he's still an important
national figure and he could be an effective campaigner in the
Northeast and in Missouri where he was born,'' said South. ``He
could be helpful if he wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the primaries, Bradley did not cloak his disdain for
Gore, accusing the vice president of distorting the impact of his
universal health care plan and aspects of his record as a New
Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had made his deep commitment to racial unity a central
campaign theme and was particularly upset when Gore charged his
health plan would hurt blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe you will tell the truth as president if
you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley asked Gore on
Jan. 26. That's a question the Republicans used to criticize Gore
during their convention and are likely to use again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he and Bradley have put the primaries behind
them, and added he would welcome the former senator's help in the
fall. Bradley has said he is willing to campaign for the Democratic
standard-bearer, but he has already scheduled a tour in September
and October for his latest book, ``The Journey From Here,'' which
explores the issues of his own presidential campaign.

speakers who may overshadow him.
</P>
<P>
   On an evening some have dubbed ``liberal night,'' Bradley will
appear onstage along with the keynoter, Tennessee Rep. Harold Ford;
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; and two of the party's best orators,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said the former senator is
looking forward to addressing the convention. And whether or not
his oratory matches the others, Hauser said, Bradley believes it is
``more important for the record than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley certainly would have preferred to be delivering
the acceptance speech Thursday night as the party's nominee, his
spokesman said he has ``no regrets'' about his campaign, is over
his disappointment and without any hesitation will reinforce the
endorsement of Gore that he finally made last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Bradley finally released his 359 delegates, freeing
them to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley will talk ``about his support for Al Gore
and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and the basis for that
support,'' said Hauser. ``He will tell why Gore will make a
significantly better president than George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Bradley surfaced after four months of political
seclusion and offered a belated and minimalist endorsement of Gore.
During a rally in Green Bay, Wis., where he was unavailable to
answer any questions, Bradley essentially told the crowd that Gore
was far preferable to Bush, the Republican presidential candidate,
and as a Democrat, he wanted to see his party win in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, Bradley used his July endorsement speech to talk
about the agenda of his unsuccessful presidential primary campaign,
including his commitment to erasing child poverty, expanding health
care coverage to everyone and enacting campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser said Bradley will talk about these issues again Tuesday,
noting that ``these challenges haven't gone away.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, an adviser to the Gore campaign in California, said
Gore is hopeful Bradley will rise to the occasion and put his stamp
of approval on the Democratic ticket ``in a way that appeals to the
voters he was aiming at in the primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore may have bashed him easily, but he's still an important
national figure and he could be an effective campaigner in the
Northeast and in Missouri where he was born,'' said South. ``He
could be helpful if he wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the primaries, Bradley did not cloak his disdain for
Gore, accusing the vice president of distorting the impact of his
universal health care plan and aspects of his record as a New
Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had made his deep commitment to racial unity a central
campaign theme and was particularly upset when Gore charged his
health plan would hurt blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe you will tell the truth as president if
you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley asked Gore on
Jan. 26. That's a question the Republicans used to criticize Gore
during their convention and are likely to use again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he and Bradley have put the primaries behind
them, and added he would welcome the former senator's help in the
fall. Bradley has said he is willing to campaign for the Democratic
standard-bearer, but he has already scheduled a tour in September
and October for his latest book, ``The Journey From Here,'' which
explores the issues of his own presidential campaign.

 &HT;    Cancer experience begins with frightening choices
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Jim Morris is the outdoor reporter for the Dayton Daily News.
Morris, 55, spent the past three years battling Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma. In a two-part series, he recounts his struggle and shares
his insights about this fight for his life. Today, Morris writes
about his initial diagnosis, treatment and the news that he didn't
want to hear.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - I was scared to death.
</P>
<P>
   There really isn't any other way of putting it. I could look
back at the experience and say it was a ``piece of cake,'' now that
it's several months in my rear view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   But I won't. No cake here. If you want cake, go find Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrifying experience. It was, and continues to be, a
life-or-death situation. I don't really know when cancer ceases to
be life or death. They say five years. I don't know. I'm not there
yet. I look forward to it, although I suspect it will never leave
my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a doctor at the James Cancer Hospital in Columbus put it
in the simplest of terms: ``The only choice you have is to take
this treatment or die of your disease.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for take it or leave it?
</P>
<P>
   I have been told I have cancer twice. The first time was on a
winter day in early 1997. Don't let anybody tell you differently,
it has to be the worst day in a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   I wince when I hear of a person finding out he or she has
cancer. You go through your daily life and don't think about it.
Me? Cancer? Naw.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is my particular brand of the nasty
stuff. As cancers go, it's ``better'' than some and ``worse'' than
others. You don't want it. But I will say, it's probably better to
have it now than, say, 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best days of a person's life is the day when someone
tells you it's gone. After seeing friends die from cancer, one type
or another in recent years and months, you count yourself very
lucky at every little milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tumors are reduced 70 percent,'' I heard after my second
or third CAT scan. Then later that same year, after many weeks of
chemotherapy, two doctors seemed overjoyed to be the ones to tell
me their tests found no more lymphoma in my body.
</P>
<P>
   My good days lasted about 18 months. No more cancer, right?
What's this remission stuff? It's gone. I refused to use the term
remission.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day in May 1999 I woke up with my right leg about twice
the size of my left. A quick call to my doctor brought a quick
ultrasound test. Every doctor in the hospital knew what it was
without looking: a nasty little condition called deep vein
thrombosis. A blood clot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I don't think the doctors were as concerned about
treating the condition (they knew what they were doing with blood
thinners, etc.) as what caused it. Another CAT scan confirmed their
diagnosis and hit me like the proverbial ton of bricks: The
lymphoma was back.
</P>
<P>
   A tumor was pressing on a vein, causing the restricted blood
flow in the leg and creating the condition for a clot. And there
were other tumors, too, ones that had grown since my last checkup
scan a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Another bad day, maybe worse than that day in 1997. I really
thought it was gone. I thought all those toxic chemicals I had
pumped through my body for about eight months had cured me. How
foolish to think that. I know now.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't go home to think about what to do next. My oncologist
and cardiologist sat with me and said the best course was to go on
the attack again, right away. The next round of chemotherapy would
begin the next day, a 24-hour drip.
</P>
<P>
   I had been told when I ``had cancer'' the first time that there
was a program at several of the nation's top cancer hospitals
called a bone marrow transplant. The doctor said it was being used
more and more for people with lymphoma. I heard even more about it
during a second-opinion visit to the Cleveland Clinic in early
1997. Only there, they went into more detail, saying the procedure
was being done by capturing the patient's own ``baby cells'' and
later returning them to his body.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great fortunes for me was that it was determined
early, by a most painful test, that my marrow was clean. Good
stuff, my marrow. The only problem was I was 52 and had diabetes. I
might not be a good candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the last day of my chemotherapy in late 1997, I had a
heart attack. That's all I needed, right? I won't go into the
details, but it was an MI (myocardial infarction). The doctors
didn't believe it had anything to do with the chemotherapy, but
I'll always wonder. My arteries were clean. Doctors didn't see any
kind of heart operation or procedure in my future, just diet and
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Now I had two battles to fight _ make it three, with the
diabetes. But the cancer was gone, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   As I gained some strength back, I began a program that has, I
believed, changed my life for the better _ cardiovascular
rehabilitation at Upper Valley Medical Center, the hospital nearest
my home. (It began at Stouder Memorial Hospital in Troy, before
that facility closed.)
</P>
<P>
   Having a heart attack, no matter how well I survived it,
certainly didn't do anything for my chances at a stem cell
transplant. I think my doctor realized that, too.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed, too. After early treatments proved successful
on the lymphoma the second time around, the doctor had brought the
idea of a transplant back into the picture. He set up an
appointment in Columbus, at the James Cancer Hospital at Ohio State
University, and we were all talking about a ``stem cell
transplant.'' The old ``bone marrow transplant'' wasn't in my
future.
</P>
<P>
   When I walked into the Columbus hospital for my first interview
with a transplant doctor, it was, no question, a scary experience.
Remember, no cake here.
</P>
<P>
   That doctor _ and all the others who would review my case _
literally held my life in their hands. They could reject me, and
with all those strikes against me, who could blame them? I was over
50, diabetic, had a partially functional heart and lymphoma that
came back once after I was ``cured'' (my term). My father had died
of a heart attack at 54 and my mother died of cancer at about the
same age. Oh, and one other thing, I was overweight and had been
since high school.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight isn't good. I know it, you know it and every doctor
in the world knows it. But in a strange way, it might have done me
some good, because I didn't look sick. Despite what I had been
through with diabetes, cancer, chemotherapy, heart attack and
cancer again, I didn't really look all that sick. Yes, my stride
was slower, but tmail at jimmorris(at)coxohio.com or by phone at

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The folks back in Texarkana, Texas, should be proud of Marjorie
Scardino. True to her Lone Star State roots, Scardino, the chief
executive of Pearson PLC, thinks big.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1997, when she took charge of Pearson _ a British
publisher whose holdings include Penguin Books, The Economist, The
Financial Times and a major educational publishing operation _
Scardino has overhauled the formerly sleepy company, engineering
major acquisitions and asset sales as well as smaller deals.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Scardino contends, is a media company poised for
growth by extending its books, newspapers and magazines into
online, interactive communications. But the dizzying pace of change
has made it difficult for even some sophisticated financial
analysts to gauge the impact of the makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyzing how the existing businesses are performing is very
difficult, which makes it tough to evaluate management,'' said
Michael Nathanson, a publishing industry analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investors in Britain seem to love Scardino's attempt to
propel a stodgy company into the new economy. Since she took the
reins, the stock, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, has
risen more than 160 percent _ nearly triple the performance of
Britain's main index, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Marjorie factor,'' one analyst said. ``They think
she can do magic.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company is so confident of investor support that Pearson
has secured a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where its
shares will begin trading in September.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month Scardino announced Pearson's purchase of
National Computer Systems, based in Minneapolis, for $2.5 billion
in cash. The purchase is meant to let Pearson expand its electronic
educational business to include testing services and the connection
of schools to homes.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is raising the money for the deal through a rights
offering that creates roughly 25 percent more shares _ a move that
worried some investors because the shares were sold at below-market
prices. Nonetheless, investors and analysts generally supported the
deal. And despite some concerns that Pearson was making yet another
high-priced acquisition, analysts generally found it a good
strategic fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think education will change, and technology has
given people the way to change it,'' an enthusiastic Scardino said
in a telephone interview last week. ``It gives us the way to
integrate the assessment portion of education in our school
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthy as the deal may be, though, it goes on a Pearson plate
already heaped with acquisitions still waiting to be digested _
including the educational book division of Simon &AMP; Schuster, which
Pearson bought for $4.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Scardino has been unflinching in selling high-profile,
but peripheral, operations, like the group that owns Madame
Tussaud's wax museum, Pearson's stake in various Lazard Freres
investment arms, and its holdings in the BSkyB satellite
broadcasting business. But at some point, analysts say, Pearson's
chief will need to demonstrate her ability to manage the company
she has recast in her image.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Picker, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, wrote
last week in a report that recommended holding, but not buying, the
stock that ``management is increasingly important, as publishers
attempt to shift from a preservation focus to a growth focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating Pearson's management skills is particularly difficult
at a company that is undergoing change at such lightning speed.
Even a key measurement _ profits or losses from continuing
operations _ tends to be a floating figure on such a fluid ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Profits and losses generated by one-time transactions have
accounted for an unusually large _ and varying _ chunk of operating
profit before taxes. In 1998, for example, the company reported 250
million pounds in operating profits. That represented 37.4 percent
of profits before taxes and interest. Last year, it posted 318
million pounds in operating profits, which accounted for about 50
percent of the 627 million pounds in profits before taxes and
interest. The balance was asset sales that included 348 million
pounds from the sale of Pearson's stake in the BSkyB satellite
broadcasting business.
</P>
<P>
   This year, analysts' estimates vary, but a new Morgan Stanley
report projects Pearson's profits from continuing operations at 357
million pounds, or 62 percent of profits before restructuring
charges and interest.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce it all to the simplest numbers: net per-share earnings
rose from 6 pence in 1997 to 74.1 pence in 1998 and fell back to
48.2 pence last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company whose financials change so dramatically with
acquisitions and sales, as evidenced by the huge percentage of
profits generated by transactions, makes it impossible with any
certainty to see what is happening to the performance of the
underlying operations,'' said Bruce Greenwald, a professor of
finance and economics at Columbia University's business school.
``That issue is crucial to the future because acquisition activity
only makes sense if supported by strong operating abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In any acquisition, a buyer has some flexibility about writing
down costs in the year of the purchase. With publishing companies,
for example, those costs may include a portion of the expenses of
creating educational reading programs, paying writers' advances and
carrying inventory. Depending on how the numbers are recorded,
future profit projections can look better than they might have
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's publishing operations represented 52 percent of its
$5.37 billion in 1999 sales. But while the company provided pro
forma comparisons for sales between 1998 and 1999, to reflect the
acquisitions, it did not provide pro forma numbers for 1998
operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's Nathanson expressed his frustration over this issue
in a recent report. ``Pro forma historical comparisons are
difficult to make, to say the least,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even some bottom-line estimates are particularly complex. For
example, Pearson releases three different per-share earnings
figures _ earnings per equity share, earnings after removing
one-time charges but before Internet investments, and earnings per
share after one-time charges and after Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   A Pearson spokesman, John Phallon, contends that such numbers
illuminate, rather than obscure, its financial performance because
they distinguish performance before and after acquisitions. Still,
Nathanson and a second analyst who insisted on anonymity said that
separating out Internet spending implies that Pearson wants
outsiders to view it is a mere extra. ``The reality is that
Internet spending is not an option,'' Nathanson said. ``It is a
necessity, given their businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Phallon added that the company also provided ``underlying sales
growth, trading margins'' and other measures to help investors. And
he said that providing 1998 pro forma figures for the Simon &AMP;
Schuster unit would have been difficult since its former owner,
Viacom, treated costs differently than did Pearson. Still,
Nathanson said those comparisons would have been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Several other analysts said they too found the numbers
exceedingly complex. But they said they were leery of being
critical for fear that Pearson could make access more difficult.
Phallon contends he has found no difficulty among analysts ``in
understanding how we present our financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   Some deals, experts acknowledged, have been extremely clever.
Nathanson cited Pearson's television programming units, which were
worth about $1.5 billion before Scardino formed an alliance with
Bertlesmann and CLT-UFA, the big European broadcaster, to create
Audiofina. Pearson's 22 percent of Audiofina currently has a market
value of $4.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the premium prices paid for some recent acquisitions
have put extra pressure on Pearson's management to make them pay
off. Pearson paid $460 million, or about 1.6 times annual sales,
for the small children's book publisher Dorling Kindersly _ a high
multiple by traditional standards, according to industry
executives. The price for National Computer Systems was 50 times
annual profits, which analysts have also generally characterized as
top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And while Pearson's expansions may bring many advantages, size
alone is not magical. Even after combining Pearson's existing
educational businesses with the Simon and Schuster unit, the
company has had mixed results in getting schools to use its books.
Though Pearson has done well in California, for example, its
performance in Texas has been mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jovanovich, president of Pearson Publishing, said he was
pleased that educational sales were up 15 percent, but added, ``I
wish we had done better in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   And not all publishing experts are impressed by Pearson's heavy
investment in the education market. ``Why couldn't Pearson have
done a joint venture with NCS,'' one industry expert said of the
National Computer deal. ``Why did they need to buy it?''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovich said that National Computing's software programs for
helping parents and teachers assess students' classroom performance
could be complementary to Pearson's textbook business and online
testing operations.
</P>
<P>
   And while Pearson says that it can find $50 million in cost
savings by combining with National Computer, gaining additional
revenues could be a far trickier route to increased profitability.
To one expert in the educational technology field, the issue will
be getting two different cultures to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating educational content is different from building and
testing administrative software for the schools,'' this person
said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid riling Pearson in
a field in which the company holds increasing power. ``The question
is whether they can integrate the educational experience and
combine it with the assessment business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson itself had initially considered only an alliance with
National Computer and had even discussed that possibility with the
company. But when National Computer's chairman, Russ Gullotti, said
he was going to retire, he approached Jovanovich about assuming his
position. Scardino _ always on the lookout for a deal _ chose to
buy the company, perhaps, in part, because she was concerned about
losing Jovanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while Jovanovich and other Pearson managers toil to
incorporate this latest acquisition, investors and analysts will
have their work cut out for them, too _ trying to get a fix on
Scardino's ever-changing company. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wearing that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Political junkies, chew on this demoralizing fact: Al Gore and
George W. Bush have already spent $150 million, and their campaigns
get built-in coverage from the networks, yet not only have they
failed to produce a spectacle as compelling as the World Wrestling
Federation's ``SmackDown!'' they can't even muster the ratings of
``The King of Queens'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   The first law in the modern entertainment state is that you have
to know how to put on a really big show. We are a nation devoted to
extravaganzas. Americans voraciously watch pageants and quiz shows;
they fork over fat cash for rock concerts, Tony Robbins seminars
and ``Riverdance''; they even tune in dutifully for such admittedly
boring events as the Academy Awards. Winning a devoted audience
doesn't seem to require any special Hollywood magic either.
</P>
<P>
   Every self-respecting pro sport can put on playoffs and a
championship that mesmerizes millions of viewers. Even the military
was able to stage-manage the Persian Gulf war _ a blowout by the
first inning _ so that Americans were enthralled for more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
   But all the ``genius'' political consultants, all the hard and
soft money and all the free media still produce a presidential
campaign that goes down like cod-liver oil, featuring speeches that
no one listens to and photo ops that no one wants to see. A
population that won't miss a weekly election on ``Survivor'' can't
be bothered to notice the world's most important political contest.
</P>
<P>
   Several explanations for this dismal failure present themselves.
The snobs' conclusion: American voters are stupid. Faced with
weighty policy debates, the theory goes, the average stupefied
citizen simply crashes.
</P>
<P>
   This is nonsense, of course. Anyone who believes the campaign is
too smart for voters isn't following it. Gore and Bush spend a lot
less time discussing Medicare Part B than they do posing with
Latina grandmothers in front of American flags. The campaign isn't
too hard. It's too dull.
</P>
<P>
   Others have argued that the candidates themselves seem too
remote, their lives of power and privilege too far removed from the
everyday people whose interest they are courting. Which is just as
far off base as the snobs' argument.
</P>
<P>
   Modern politics is infested with a ridiculous, phony populism.
The candidates _ the smartest, savviest pols in the nation _ prove
their presidential fitness by wearing jeans, flipping pancakes,
reading to schoolkids and generally wallowing in their own
mundanity. Gore can't stop being dull. Bush willfully suppresses
his charisma in order to seem serious.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of aversion to stardom and celebrity isn't just
impractical; it's downright un-American. A more compelling argument
is that the campaign ignores the three fundamental requirements of
drama: conflict, uncertainty and a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like to pretend campaigns are mano-a-mano death
struggles, but in truth they are eerily devoid of direct conflict.
The guiding principle is not clash of the titans, but parallel
play. The business of flinging mud and whispering accusations is
outsourced to campaign spokespeople and, on occasion, to the
candidates' family members. But the candidates themselves don't
squabble or wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore won't meet till the debates in October, and even
those encounters will be carefully sterilized. This disengagement,
say the pundits, gives them ``stature.'' The candidates are staying
above the fray _ but as a result, there's no fray and little worth
watching. It is possible to stage a spectacle without conflict _
see ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _ but it's hard to reject
both conflict and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Any first-time producer knows to cut away at the moment of
highest tension, to keep the audience on tenterhooks, ready to tune
in next week. But the presidential campaigns leave nothing to
guessing. Speeches are distributed in advance. Even the
vice-presidential nomination, which should be the campaign's grand
surprise, leaks out slowly and deliberately, allowing the campaign
a no-risk preview of voters' response to any possible choice.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions are scripted to the second. Dissenting voices, if
not entirely banished, are consigned to low-visibility venues like
the South Dakota delegation at a 7 a.m. prayer breakfast. It's not
a weeklong celebration of democracy. It's the North Korean
Communist Party Congress. Is it any wonder no one wants to watch?
</P>
<P>
   Without conflict and uncertainty, a shapely narrative becomes
crucial. Any tale that you care about arcs from beginning to middle
to end. But the campaign doesn't manage to tell any story at all,
and that is the fatal blow.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story: A young orphan discovers that he has magical
powers and sets off to a school for wizards. He learns that the
evil wizard who killed his parents is back, looking for a magic
stone. Through a series of tests and puzzles, the orphan vanquishes
his nemesis and is celebrated as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a story: Al Gore gives a speech in Clayton, Mo., on
children's health; Al Gore gives a speech in Niles, Ill., on health
care; Al Gore gives a speech in Bridgeville, Pa., on women's
health. Wash, rinse, repeat till November.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, there is no solution in sight, for these
relentlessly disappointing performances are governed by an iron
logic. Now that cable, satellite, VCRs, the Internet have
fragmented the American audience into 260 million pieces, national
entertainment depends on narrowcasting. But national politics
can't. Presidential candidates must appeal to a majority of all
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Insurgents and third-party candidates can afford dramatic,
erratic campaigns. They don't mind offending because they know
they're going to lose. That's why the 1992 Republican convention,
dominated by the culture warrior Pat Buchanan, was by far the most
interesting convention in decades. It delighted conservative
activists and drew good ratings _ and it was a monumental disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major parties, any variation from the script is seen
as a risk, in which the danger of alienating any voters outweighs
the possible advantage of shaking things up. For now, campaigns
remain boring because they have to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety First campaign will win Gore or Bush the election,
but at a cost. The nation lives by the agenda of sports and
entertainment. A president who can't understand that risks
irrelevance. He won't know how to speak to his constituents, and we
won't take the trouble to listen. Maybe it's time for another movie
star in the White House.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the Democrats gathering in Los Angeles for their
national convention don't know yet who John Witchel is. But he and
his friends are planning to crash the Democrats' party with a
straightforward message: they want in. ``We already drive every
significant sector of the economy,'' Witchel says. ``The keys to
the kingdom are squarely in our hands. I'm here to say there's a
next generation of Internet executives, and we're ready to become
national political players.''
</P>
<P>
   John Witchel is a big, driven man, a former Stanford jock with a
booming voice. At 32, he is running his third successful company,
the San Francisco-based Red Gorilla, while serving on the boards of
seven other Internet start-ups. But Witchel's current obsession is
not business but politics - an arena he feels is ripe for the
attention of entrepre-neurs. ``Priced today,'' he says, sounding
slightly surprised by his dis-covery, ``politics is the bargain of
the century. For $10 million you could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Witchel is interested in buying politicians. What he
wants, simply, is to be a political somebody, ``one of a small
handful of trusted people,'' as he puts it, ``who can be helpful
when needed.'' So Witchel has just helped start a new enterprise,
PAC.com, a political action committee aimed at centrist Democrats.
Along with Witchel, the main organizers include his Red Gorilla
colleague Wade Randlett, Tim Newell of E*Offering, Joe Kraus of
Excite &LR; home, Chris Larsen of E-Loan and E. David Ellington of
NetNoir. While these power brokers lack the star power of
Hollywood, they have an even more glamorous currency that they plan
to start handing out: equity.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, PAC.com's 20 members will each contribute $1,000 a
month in plain old cash to politicians who meet with them for
dinner and conversation. (This year, they're focusing on Congress,
where a small group has more ``leverage,'' and not on the
presidential race.) That's the traditional part; what's new is that
members will also give stock in their pre-I.P.O. or newly public
companies to PAC.com to put into a kitty and disburse over time.
``We can cash it out and give it to a politician,'' explains
Randlett, ``and say here's five grand. Or we can say here's $5,000
worth of shares; you hang on to it and see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of equity could have vast implications for the world
of politics. If Joe Kraus of Excite, for example, had contributed
just $1,000 worth of stock to a senator right when the company went
public in April 1996, three years later, even after some scary
losses and plunges, that senator would have had $15,992 to spend on
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty tempting proposition, though even tech-friendly
politicians express reservations. Representative Adam Smith, a
Democrat from Washington and the campaign chairman for the New
Democrat Network, which has worked hard to forge links to high
tech, believes that few candidates will be willing to play the
market with their campaign budgets. After all, the stock could just
as easily be eToys as Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does believe, however, that the identification with
PAC.com and its pool of stock might ``help brand candidates a
little bit further'' by linking them to the New Economy. Senator
Patrick Leahy of Vermont doesn't accept money from PAC's himself,
but he, too, sees the appeal of the idea. ``I think it's an
intriguing way for young dot-com people to participate,'' says
Leahy, who has long championed Internet issues. ``It makes sense to
them. As far as ethics, the bottom line is, whenever you take any
donation, it's reported, it's public knowledge. Whether you take
cash from or stock in Polluters-``R''-Us.com, if you're voting
against an environmental issue, the public will know.''
</P>
<P>
   If politicians are cautious, campaign-finance reformers have
already made up their minds. ``A sweetheart deal in pre-I.P.O.
stock has a back-room stench to it, even if it's legal,'' charges
E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan Center for Justice
at the New York University School of Law, which has been studying
campaign finance. ``If you believe contribution limits mean
anything, then making a contribution that explodes in value within
a few days is a blatant subversion of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Turovsky, a partner at Manatt, Phelps &AMP; Phillips in Los
Angeles and the election-law specialist who is advising PAC.com,
sounds unconcerned, however, and asserts that he has ``no doubt''
that it's appropriate for politicians to receive stocks. ``There's
nothing in the F.E.C. regulations or statutes that would prohibit
it,'' he says. In fact, in correspondence with PAC.com, officials
at the Federal Elections Commission affirmed the plan to give out
stock.
</P>
<P>
   While PAC.com is a small, start-up operation, it is undoubtedly
what its founders like to call, in Internet jargon, ``scalable'':
other PAC's and individuals from around the country can borrow the
idea and take it where they want to. For better or worse, the world
of campaign finance is likely to change. Like so much else in
American culture, politics will be pulled even further into the
orbit of the stock market and the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   And along with it, the influence of men like John Witchel stands
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   when microsoft first got into trouble with the justice
department, the established tech companies, who used to keep their
distance from national politics, swiftly beefed up their lobbying
operations and began playing the Washington game. PAC.com, however,
represents a different trend; its members have little patience for
doing government affairs by the book and tend to see the big
computer companies as hopelessly old-fashioned. ``The CEOs who
ruled Silicon Valley five years ago are middle-aged and
corporate,'' Witchel says disdainfully. ``Our guys are in their 20s
and 30s. They have 25 employees. They don't have lobbyists. They
don't go to Business Roundtable meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Witchel and his allies don't even look like traditional Silicon
Valley types; they're more frat boy than geek. At 40, Tim Newell
calls himself ``the old man'' of the group; a husky Vermonter, he
towers over most Internet executives like a football player among
chess-club nerds. Newell, a former White House aide turned
investment banker, runs E*Offering, which enables individuals to
invest in I.P.O.'s online. Joe Kraus, a founder of Excite, is a
goateed 29-year-old; his company, begun in a burrito shop during
his senior year at Stanford, had a market value early this month of
$5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   David Ellington, the cigar-smoking, 40-year-old CEO of NetNoir,
runs the Web's leading black-oriented site. Chris Larsen, 39, a
windsurfing enthusiast, is the founder and CEO of E-Loan, an online
lending service whose original interface he programmed himself.
Wade Randlett, 35, who favors tailor-made suits, was a Democratic
political consultant who helped found Silicon Valley's first PAC,
the Technology Network, in 1997 - ``hands-down the single person
who defined high-tech fund-raising,'' says Newell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like NASA was in the '60s,'' claims David Ellington.
``Then, everyone wanted to hang out with the astronauts. Now
everyone wants to be down with the future.''
</P>
<P>
   These self-styled ``astronauts'' are largely democrats. They
made their fortunes on Bill Clinton's watch and became natural
allies of his centrist, pro-trade, ``New Democrat'' agenda. Of
course, plenty of Internet entrepreneurs remain Republicans; George
Bush has raised millions in Silicon Valley, and Republican
congressmen like J.C. Watts of Oklahoma have made pilgrimages there
to court high-tech supporters. But Witchel and his fellow PAC.com
members share a Northern California ethos that makes them
culturally out of tune with traditional Republican values.
PAC.commers say they care about choice and the environment. They
don't want the Ten Commandments posted in schools. They love making
money and are perfectly comfortable doing it alongside homosexuals
and foreigners. What they see in Gore and the New Democrats are
politicians who will not only respect their style but who will also
make sure that their industry stays as unregulated, un-unionized
and untaxed as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Already, PAC.com has established what Randlett calls ``a
strategic co-marketing agreement'' with the New Democrat Network, a
group of pro-business Capitol Hill Democrats who borrow freely from
the metaphors and values of the New Economy in their quest to
modernize their party and wean it away from the labor unions and
old-line liberals. In just four years, billing itself as ``a
venture capital fund for the Democratic Party,'' the group has
become the largest caucus in the House, with 65 members. It now has
14 New Democrat Senators as well, and it runs its own PAC and
recruits, promotes and finances promising centrist candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rosenberg, 35, the president and founder of the New
Democrat Network, has made alliances with Silicon Valley a central
part of his political strategy from the beginning. Rosenberg
recognizes that Internet entrepreneurs need politicians, as Newell
says, in order ``to be in the conversation.'' They want access,
relationships and connections in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of issues on the table in Washington right now
- Internet taxation, privacy regulations, export controls, visas
for high-tech immigrant workers - that Witchel and his group might
want to weigh in on. But the PAC.commers insist that they're less
interested in short-term lobbying for a specific agenda than in
building networks of influence. ``Look at where the great power
bases of the world are,'' argues Witchel. ``One is in venture
capital. Another is in Washington, D.C. Just as I spend an enormous
amount of time getting to know investment bankers before I actually
need their money, I do the same with politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Witchel's approach is a firm belief that Internet
businesses are models for how all social and political institutions
can work more effectively. The young entrepreneurs of PAC.com tend
to use the buzz words of the Internet economy to describe every
facet of life. They want to ``disintermediate'' political
go-betweens and substitute their own networks for established
political machines. They want to ``identify an expanded target
market'' and then ``aggregate high-net-worth individuals'' to
change the base of support for the Democratic Party. As Newell
boasts, PAC.com's modest goal is to ``transform the business of
politics and the politics of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Newell says, politics is the same as investment
banking: ``You have a product, you have to go out and raise
money.'' He chuckles. ``PAC.com is just old-fashioned grass-roots
politics _ grass-roots organizing of millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   PAC.com, for the moment, eschews soft-money donations _ the
uncapped gifts to political parties rather than individual
candidates _ but other high-tech figures have begun experimenting
with the system. Marc Andreessen, the 29-year-old founder of
Netscape, chairman of Loudcloud and Uber-geek, is part of PAC.com's
broader network. He has been hanging out with Vice President Al
Gore for years and recently dropped a quarter of a million dollars
on the Democratic National Committee. It is, Andreessen admits, ``a
lot'' by the standards of politics. ``But in my world,'' he adds,
``if I invested just $250,000 in a new company, they might think I
wasn't all that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the value of money in Silicon Valley and
in Washington - what Andreessen calls ``arbitrage'' - gets the
attention of young entrepreneurs.``If you think there's a lot of
money in politics now,'' Andreessen says, ``you haven't seen
anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world view of PAC.com, that's nothing to be afraid of;
politicians are merely the last ones to get dealt into the game.
After all, in the New Economy, argues Witchel, everyone from
receptionists to CEOs is getting paid in stock already. ``It's just
the way we do business,'' he declares. ``Doesn't it make sense for
everyone to participate in the same system?''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign-finance watchdogs certainly don't think so. At a time
when the market's reach into every corner of civic life seems
almost unchecked, critics ask, why make politics, too, dependent on
stock prices? ``Candidates are already treated as commodities to be
invested in; we might as well slap logos on them,'' says
Rosenkranz. ``Contributing stock is the perfect completion of the
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Witchel himself is torn. He'll exalt the power of skyrocketing
stock options one minute, then turn around and critique the culture
that has grown up around them. ``The thing about Silicon Valley
that's a problem for me,'' he says, ``is when it's just about
money. It's spiritually bankrupt. People get rich, they start to
smell like money, dress like money. It makes the whole culture ugly
and hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's what politics offers to the callow entrepreneurs
of Silicon Valley: a spiritual dimension, a meaningful,
civic-minded pursuit beyond the world of business and money. But
first they have to buy their way in.

 BEHIND THE SCENES: BRENTWOOD, BUNNIES AND BARBRA By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everybody wanted to go behind the scenes Monday at
the Democratic National Convention, at least during the long hours
before President Clinton's address.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you looked on television or on the World Wide Web,
people were promising to take you backstage, past the security
guards, beyond the tall hedges of those Brentwood estates where the
glitterati were celebrating their wonderfulness and where,
presumably, all the really juicy stuff was going on. But if
Monday's reports are any indication, the convention is a lot like
Hollywood, with nothing behind the scenery but plywood, sawdust and
a snoozing gaffer.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal, on its Web page, followed Rod O'Connor,
the convention's chief operating officer and ``a moving target for
favor seekers of all sorts.'' O'Connor's day began at 8 a.m., with
a staff meeting at the Staples Center. At 8:45, he and the
communications staff discussed the message of the day. At 9:15,
there was the first official media briefing, and the whining began.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor promised to help smooth the ``check-in-crush'' of
journalists waiting to get into the convention. At 10 a.m., he was
cornered by a staff member from Speakout.com, which was upset about
its placement in the media center. At 11:15 a.m., meeting with the
hall management staff in the Los Angeles Lakers' dressing room,
O'Connor had to figure out how to get more local media people onto
the podium, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a another staff meeting, O'Connor had to parcel out
skyboxes for opening night. ``Let's give B-3 to the mayor,'' he
decided. His cell phone rang. A major campaign donor wanted more
tickets to Thursday night. O'Connor made soothing noises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the whole business of the convention here,'' he told
the National Journal. ``You try to sift out what people really need
as opposed to what they'd like to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Web pages featured their Hollywood party reports,
promising to take us into those exclusive enclaves. Long gone,
apparently, are the days when starlets jumped nude into the
swimming pool while Errol Flynn got into a fistfight at the bar.
Yes, the reports were filled with bold-faced names and the sound of
champagne corks popping, but there was a noticeable scarcity of
juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats' deft decision to hold this week's extravaganza
in the heart of Los Angeles has given the party scene an almost
mythical quality as the nation's top political bigwigs connect with
some of Hollywood's hottest celebrities,'' wrote Molly M. Peterson
for the Hotline's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Almost mythical, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Friedman, the gossip columnist for Fox News, praised
Barbra Streisand's lavish Malibu compound, where Democrats with
thick wallets were gathered Sunday to donate $5 million to
President Clinton's presidential library. But, there was some
discontent beneath the surface, he reported. Some of the fat cats
were upset that Streisand did not favor them with a song. (``Good
dirt, Roger,'' the anchorwoman enthused.)
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's Jeannette Walls went to a party at the Playboy mansion
and found that some of the well-known names in attendance did not
wish to be photographed in such a place. And the bunnies were
off-limits, too. ``These girls are working,'' beefy security guards
warned reporters. ``They're not here to be interviewed. They're
here to mingle with the guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, the screenwriter of ``Showgirls'' and
best-selling author of ``American Rhapsody,'' wrote in Salon.com
that Hollywood was of two minds about the nomination of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, a well-known critic of violence and sex in movies, as
Vice President Al Gore's running mate. Should they shun him for
fear of their livelihoods, or embrace him as better than a
Republican? ``This was a quandary worse than whether to pay Adam
Sandler 20 mill for his next picture,'' Eszterhas explained.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Monday afternoon on CNN's ``Talk Back Live,''
Eszterhas joined a panel fussing over whether Hollywood was going
to dominate the convention and the campaign. Cynical views abounded
from all points of the political spectrum, though none were able to
match the levels of cynicism exhibited by the people whose e-mail
messages are regular features of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians will take money from whoever will give it to
them,'' one cyber-citizen opined. ``It's the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pleaded, ``Stop glorifying these egomaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg of CNN decided that the Democratic convention
was structured pretty much like the Republican one, to deflect
attention from each party's weak points. ``Democrats gathering in
Los Angeles are being treated to a strong dose of religion,
morality and character,'' Rothenberg wrote. ``Welcome to Bizarro
World, where each party addresses its weaknesses and hopes to
neutralize its opponents' advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   So pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. It's just
another day in Bizarro World.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever you do, don't go near the bunnies.

MISSILE DEFENSE IS ONCE AGAIN A CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the waning days of the Cold War, one of the main
disputes on national security between Republicans and Democrats
involved missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan dreamed of protecting the United States
with an impenetrable missile shield _ a Strategic Defense
Initiative _ that, as he said in his second Inaugural Address,
``would render nuclear weapons obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats derided this ``Star Wars'' plan as technologically
infeasible and preposterously expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Soviet Union fell, other national security matters like
Iraq and Bosnia moved to the forefront politically and the question
of missile defense faded into the background. It was hardly
mentioned in the 1992 and 1996 election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue is back, in full force.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican party platform adopted in Philadelphia this month
and the Democratic platform to be approved in Los Angeles this week
both advocate construction of a missile defense system. But beyond
the superficial political statement that they are in favor of the
idea, the parties are proposing quite different systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want ``robust missile defenses'' to be deployed
``based on an evaluation of the best available options at the
earliest possible date.'' The Clinton administration, the
Republican platform states, ``has become hopelessly entangled in
its commitment to an obsolete treaty signed in 1972,'' a reference
to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, signed with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, by contrast, accuse the Republicans of favoring
``an unproven, expensive and ill-conceived missile defense system
that would plunge us into a new arms race.'' The Democrats call for
a ``limited national missile defense system'' that would be
``compatible with the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has made clear that he supports a
defensive system that would be based on land, at sea and possibly
in space to cover all 50 states and be extended to protect allies
in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It sounds very much like a
revival of the Reagan dream.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, adopting the Clinton policy, supports a
much more modest land-based system that could provide protection
against a small number of missiles fired at the United States by
mistake or by what the Clinton administration previously called
rogue states but now describes as ``states of concern,'' like North
Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This system should be built, in the Clinton-Gore view, only if
it can be shown to enhance national security and if the cost and
the technology are feasible. Bush calls this approach timid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who as vice president has been instrumental in setting the
administration's policy toward Russia, has expressed concerned that
any missile system would violate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty
and undermine U.S.-Russian relations. The Democratic platform's
insistence that the defense system be compatible with the treaty
was seen by some as a guarantee that no such system would ever be
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he has no qualms about pulling out of the 1972
pact if the treaty keeps a missile defense from being built.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' positions are firmly grounded and have gone
unchanged despite recent technological developments and
intelligence estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Pentagon conducted a highly publicized test over
the Pacific Ocean to show that an incoming missile could be shot
out of the air. The $100 million test failed, the second one to
fail this year, meaning that the Pentagon has yet to prove that
even a basic missile defense is practical.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, a highly classified report was sent to Congress
warning that deployment of an American national missile defense
could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold and lead
Russia to place multiple warheads on ballistic missiles that now
carry only one.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the candidates' positions in favor of missile defense
may not be shaken by such developments is that they seem to be
based as much on domestic political calculations as strategic
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush clearly understands how Reagan's dream captured the public
imagination. As recently as this spring, years after the Reagan
plan was abandoned, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 58
percent of American adults favored building a shield against
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign developed this year, Bush made a concerted drive
to speak out on national security issues to allay concerns about
his lack of experience in foreign policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, seeking to dispel any notion that Democrats
were soft on defense, developed his plan for a limited defense
system in his 1996 re-election campaign. In doing so, he employed
the technique of co-opting and modifying a popular Republican idea,
which had proved successful in areas like welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan was written into the Democratic platform in
1996, and it is basically the same plan Gore and the party have
adopted this year.

   Words you don't want to hear upon your return home from the
Democratic National Convention here in L.A.: ``But, (insert title
here, i.e., Mom, Dad ...), you didn't bring anything back for me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, well, you could have my `Gore for President' button,''
you'll say. ``NO!'' will be the definitive answer. While you might
understand the possible value someday of such a collectible, your
kids will just see it as an ugly symbol of how you forgot about
them on your really long journey.
</P>
<P>
   To help you avoid this scenario, we gathered some L.A. souvenirs
that are cheap ($20 or less), packable and fun. And here's how to
find these gifts:
</P>
<P>
   1. Hollywood glitz and glamour: Go to CityWalk at Universal
Studios Hollywood. Stroll into the Studio store, a host of other
stores or check vendors carts for everything Hollywood. Try All
Star Collections for sports memorabilia. (Note: If your kid's a
professional football fan, L.A.'s not your town.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Funky and Fun: Hop in your car and head to Venice Beach or
the Santa Monica Pier for really offbeat stuff. Tie-dyed L.A.
T-shirts, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   3. We Love L.A.: No time to spare? Never fear. Los Angeles
International Airport is jammed with souvenir shops. Crews of
California stores offer a big selection, and they're located in
several terminals.

TEXAS DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'LL SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a good thing that Republican nominee George
W. Bush doesn't plan to watch the Democratic National Convention
this week, because some of his fellow Texans have come here to help
``set the record straight'' about their governor's leadership
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   While the delegates here insist that they will not ``mess with
Texas'' by bashing their state during the convention, they will
definitely mess with Bush. They plan to tell anyone who will listen
that Democratic legislators had to fight Bush and his party all the
way in order to help poor children, teachers and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the governor used Texans during the Republican National
Convention to tout his record, Democrats will use Texans to show
that the governor either sat on the sideline, was held hostage by
Republicans in the Legislature or that he was a very reluctant
participant when it came to some very important legislation _
legislation for which he is now taking credit.
</P>
<P>
   They will portray the recent Republican convention as a sham,
one which touted diversity and inclusion. In reality, they say,
those are traits that Bush and the Republicans have never fully
understood or represented.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price was even more harsh
in referring to the Philadelphia convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a minstrel show,'' Price said, alluding to the large
number of blacks and Hispanics who performed on the stage, and the
very small percentage of minorities who were delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Houston State Rep. Sylvester Turner, a trial lawyer who will
address his fellow state delegates this morning, likened the two
conventions and their messages to a courtroom proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil trial, he said, the plaintiffs go first, as the
Republican did two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge tells jurors, `There are two sides,''' he said.
```Don't make up your minds after hearing only one side. Wait to
hear both sides.'''
</P>
<P>
   With a big smile on his face, Turner declared, ``The second half
is about to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that the message of the defense _ the Democrats _ is
``so strong, so real and so substantive,'' that it will resonate
with American families to the extent that they will realize Al Gore
is their obvious choice for president.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texans who will help carry that message to the convention
floor are State Rep. Domingo Garcia of Dallas and State. Sen. Mario
Gallegos Jr., of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who will speak tomorrow night, will talk about Bush's
education plan. He said he'll point out that Texas is No. 48 in SAT
scores and dead last in the number of children with health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will pick up on the Republican theme of ``Leave no
child behind,'' suggesting that if Bush and Republican legislators
had gotten their way many children in Texas would have been left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to fight and we had to push it,'' Gallegos said. ``He's
saying he did it. Let's get the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos said that when it came to the fight for expansion of
kindergarten in Texas, Bush's ``own aides went and testified in the
Senate that it would cost too much. George Bush fought us on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto on the teacher pay raise issue and the children's health
care initiative, with Republicans wanting far less than what
finally passed the Legislature. Still Bush is taking all the credit
for both, Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   After Democrats finish presenting their defense this week, it
will be up to the jury _ the American voters _ to decide which side
was most convincing.

WORDS OF PLEDGE TO TEXAS FLAG NOT KNOWN BY SOME TEXAS DELEGATES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The embarrassment started early for Al Gore's
loyal Texas Democrats yesterday, when the delegate chosen to lead
the morning Pledge of Allegiance was a high school senior who
needed two tries to pass Government 1.
</P>
<P>
   She passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' other delegates flunked.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Creacy, 19, of Corpus Christi, didn't care much about
politics and said she hadn't planned to go vote last March in her
first presidential primary. But her father, a union member, made
her come along to the polls, and her fellow Democrats somehow
decided that she'd be a great national delegate.
</P>
<P>
   When the party selected her to lead the U.S. and Texas pledges
of allegiance yesterday, she said she didn't even know Texas
``had'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Sad. But she memorized it.
</P>
<P>
   Sadder yet: Almost none of the other Texas delegates knew the
pledge to the Lone Star Flag.
</P>
<P>
   After the pledge to the U.S. flag, she turned to the Lone Star
flag with her hand over her heart and began:''Honor the Texas
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates looked at each other in confusion. ``What's this?''
one woman whispered.
</P>
<P>
   It's been Texas' pledge of allegiance since 1933:
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor the Texas flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pledge allegiance to thee,
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas, one and indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few faint voices in the giant ballroom recited along with
Creacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said delegate Hal Ray, a Fort Worth
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not a member of a group or civic club that starts
with a pledge of allegiance, nobody knows it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Creacy said her Corpus Christi public schools never began the
class day with a pledge of allegiance. Amazing. The way I figure
it, I recited the U.S. and Texas pledges more than 2,000 times
before my departure from the Fort Worth public schools.
</P>
<P>
   By 12th grade, we actually learned how to say ``indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard it before,'' Creacy said. ``I don't think
anybody had.''
</P>
<P>
   And these are the people who are supposed to uphold the honor of
Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Texas' honor became fightin' words later in the day, when four
Texas Democrats barged into downtown Los Angeles _ not to campaign
for Gore, but to campaign for Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A former attorney general, a state senator, a state
representative and a former Dallas County Democratic chairman all
came to defend the state against ridicule by the Gore campaign,
which has generally portrayed Texas as a backward territory and
which published a tongue-in-cheek news release declaring Houston
medically unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine Texas Democrats not being proud of the
education reforms adopted by Democrats and Republicans,'' said
Sandy Kress, an Austin lobbyist and former Dallas party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and the late Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock helped initiate education reform, Kress said, but Bush
deserves credit for strengthening the reforms and adding tougher
school discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting at the curb outside the Republicans' campaign
headquarters was a quorum of Texas Democratic lawmakers, including
Democratic state Sen. Mario Gallegos Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats, not George W. Bush, led the way to improve
health insurance for children and to bring more diversity in higher
education,'' Gallegos said. ``He has had the opportunity to improve
things. He hasn't done it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was only the first of many Bush roasts to come this week,
if Bill Clinton ever leaves town.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should remind the Texas delegates that until 1997,
Democrats had controlled the Texas Legislature for 126 years.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should also remind them to learn the Texas pledge.

SoCal IS ONE WILD RISE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thrills and chills, flips and flops.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking politics. This is what can be had on park
rides in Southern California. The area is blessed with four major
theme parks: Disneyland, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Universal
Studios and Knott's Berry Farm. &QL; 
For Democratic National Convention goers who can only free up time
for a breeze-through visit, here's a ranking of the best rides:
</P>
<P>
   1. Space Mountain (Disneyland) Great concept: a roller coaster
in the dark. The ceiling is a canopy of light-projected stars, the
music throbs, and the ride whips you into turns that you literally
can't see coming. This attraction opened 23 years ago, yet its
futuristic feel has faded only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   2. Goliath (Magic Mountain) You're given an idea of what you're
in for right away _ a precipitous free fall off the first hill.
Then, just as you recover your wits, a second hill on which you get
some serious air. Great speed. High-G turns. Definitely not for the
faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   3. Ghost Rider (Knott's) For nostalgia buffs, a big, clackety
wooden coaster. All the requisite drops and turns. Because it
doesn't try to outdo all the high-tech rides _ which at times
resemble astronaut training _ a pre-teen kid can enjoy it without
fear of losing his pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   4. Universal Studios Tour _ Time to slow things down a little.
Aboard the tram, you get a glimpse behind some Hollywood scenes,
notably the town square and clock tower in ``Back to the Future,''
and one of the favorite sights for the macabre mob: the Bates Motel
from ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Jurassic Park (Universal) All the clever animatronics of the
movie are brought forward here, which means a lot of frightening
encounters with the chronically perturbed beasts of prehistory. It
culminates in a drenching plunge _ not a bad thing in L.A. in
August.
</P>
<P>
   6. Batman (Magic Mountain) Quick, with a lot of twists and
turns, and plenty of time spent upside down. (Fill in your
political joke here ... )
</P>
<P>
   7. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride (Disneyland) For young kids _ or adults
who can't handle the big coasters. This ride is silly and
thoroughly charming. Wheel through a nocturnal London with the
``Wind in the Willows'' gang, crashing through pubs and courtrooms,
rattling over railroad tracks, and touching off the dynamite for a
fairly troubling descent into the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
   8. Colossus (Magic Mountain) The ride that put Magic Mountain on
the map. It's yet another wooden roller coaster in the Eastern
Seaboard tradition. You'll see this monster as you approach the
park on the 5 Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   9. Matterhorn Bobsleds (Disneyland) The park's first roller
coaster ride, it still feels as if it's a throwback to another era
_ you bump and jostle around that giant faux mountain, with nary a
shock absorber in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   10. Pirates of the Caribbean (Disneyland) Another tried-and-true
attraction here, even though the novelty of some of the technology
has long since worn off. The appeal of this boat ride through the
Magic Kingdom's bowels is peculiar, when you think about it: It
deals humorously with larceny, murder, torture (the mayor has been
repeatedly dunked in the town well for more than 30 years now),
female slavery, alcoholism, reckless gunplay and arson. But you'll
be singing ``Yo ho, yo ho,'' before the boat rounds the final
bend. &QL;

   ``Lame lame lame! Does United train their people to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   _ United Airlines passenger Laura Bradley, one of hundreds of
dissatisfied customers who have vented their frustrations on the
griping web site, www.untied.com.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike just about everybody else who has flown United Airlines
this summer, I've had lovely experiences with the beleaguered
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   On-time departures and early arrivals. Tasty meals served with a
smile. Plenty of leg room. Courteous ticket clerks. Luggage
delivered with a gentle, caring touch.
</P>
<P>
   One crew even sang ``Leaving On a Jet Plane'' over the intercom
as our flight took off from O'Hare, and their harmonizing abilities
put Peter, Paul &AMP; Mary to shame. And when that Miss America-looking
flight attendant pinned those special golden wings on the lapel of
little Timmy with the IV in his arm, there wasn't a dry eye on the
plane ...
</P>
<P>
   Kidding of course. Sorry to mislead you, faithful reader, but I
couldn't resist the idea of some United Airlines executive at UAL
Corp. headquarters in Elk Grove Township, reading the above
paragraphs and allowing himself to feel a glimmer of optimism
before being jerked back to harsh reality _ which is sort of how
United passengers often feel these days, come to think of it.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, my adventures with United have been as wobbly and
perilous as a Cade McNown bomb: Even when the connection is made it
ain't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was the experience I had while waiting in a line that
moved about as fluidly as Jabba the Hut after a half-dozen Happy
Meals. I actually found myself cheering when the ``DEPARTURE''
board changed to reflect an additional delay in my flight _ because
that meant I had a chance to make it to the front of the line and
check in before the damn thing took off. (I had a 95-minute cushion
when I took my spot in line. It took 110 minutes to reach the
counter.)
</P>
<P>
   At least I eventually got on my flight. A college-age woman a
few spots ahead of me _ her mountain of luggage indicating she was
either at the launch point or the tail end of a very long trip _
was given such bad news by the clerk that she was soon sobbing
full-out, her shoulders heaving as she covered her face. After she
shuffled off in search of a solution, the blase expression on that
clerk's face had several of us in line debating what sort of
penalty would be levied if one of us cracked him on the jaw and
told him to at least pretend to be concerned about the disappointed
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all heavy drama on the United front. In fact the
biggest laugh I've heard from a live audience this summer did not
occur in a theater showing ``Scary Movie'' or ``The Klumps,'' it
was the roar of derisive hooting and guffawing I heard on a United
plane as it perched in a comatose state on a runway _ engines
turned off to preserve fuel, cabin air as stale as a ``Wassup!''
joke, flight attendants offering plastic glasses of water and
orange juice to us as if we were contestants on ``Survivor'' who
had won a beverage challenge _ and the pilot got on the intercom to
explain why we'd been on that runway for more than an hour, even
though the weather was fine.
</P>
<P>
   It went something like this: ``Ladies and gentlemen, we've got
about a dozen more aircrafts lined up ahead of us, so it'll be a
while before we even get word about when we're going to be able to
take off. The problem isn't the weather here or in Chicago, but the
storms in between _ and the skies are very congested today already,
so any trouble like that is bound to cause a chain reaction. I know
you've heard a lot about the situation with United pilots, but I
wanted to let you know in this case, it's really about the weather
and a lot of traffic in the skies, and nothing else. We appreciate
your patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Haw! Get this guy his own comedy special on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm saying the pilot was lying; the factors he cited
probably really were the reasons we were trapped on that damn
runway.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that we don't want to hear that kind of thing right
now from anyone who works for United. We don't want to hear
explanations, rationalizations or excuses of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   What we want is straight talk from someone who has answers or at
least can admit to not having answers, and we want that at the
airport as well as on the plane. Right now there shouldn't be a
single ``Position Closed'' sign hanging above a single computer in
any United terminal in the country. Management needs to pay
staffers double-time, triple-time, whatever, to speed up those
lines and figure out solutions when flights are screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   There also should be a clearly identifiable supervisor at every
turn _ someone who can provide answers or at least take the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Hell, there ought to be a dunk tank set up, with a revolving
cast of UAL execs taking the plunge. I'd wait in line for that.

CARDINAL OPENS CONVENTION WITH PRAYER FOR THE UNBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill., N.Y.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles
called for an end to abortions as he delivered the invocation at
Monday night's opening of the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief address, Cardinal Roger Mahoney, one of the leading
religious voices against abortion in the state, said, ``In you, oh,
God, we trust that you will keep us ever committed to protect the
life and well-being of all people, but especially unborn children,
the sick and the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking message that might have sounded more familiar
at a Republican convention, especially with the difficulties
Democrats have had in the past trying to attract Roman Catholic
leaders to speak at their conventions. Four years ago, the late
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin declined an invitation for the convention
in Chicago. In 1984 and 1992, when the Democrats held conventions
in New York, the late Cardinal John O'Connor turned them down. Both
clerics said their reason was the party's support of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats urgently trying to reach swing and undecided
voters in what figures to be a close election, Vice President Al
Gore tried again, this time issuing an invitation last week to
Maloney. Although his anti-abortion message was antithetical to
many Democrats, the cardinal's words could be viewed as an effort
to broaden the Democratic base, and to avoid controversy over
issues like the party leadership's decision in 1992 not to permit
Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, who opposed abortion, to
speak at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But just how far the cardinal's words spread was unclear. The
four-minute invocation followed welcoming remarks by Joe Andrew,
co-chairman of the Democratic Party, who opened the convention by
tapping a gavel in mid-afternoon, a time few would be watching on
television. In the main hall of the Staples Center, only a few of
the 4,339 delegates were in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Among those listening, Gloria Johnson, a delegate from San
Diego, shook her head in disgust. She said she was a strong
believer in the separation of church and state and an advocate of
abortion rights, adding that such an invocation deserved no place
at the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's offensive,'' she said. Then referring to convention
planners, she added, ``It's their decision, but I don't want to
listen to his prayer for the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Other delegates said the participation of the cardinal would
serve the Democrats well, even if his message contradicted core
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideological rigor was never a hallmark of the Democratic
Party, except the goodness of government,'' said George Moses, a
delegate from Boise, Idaho. ``But it pleasantly surprised me to
have a discussion of the issue at any time. I consider it a sign of
good politics.''  &QL;

SANCHEZ WON'T BE GIVING SPEECH AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez withdrew Monday as a
featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention, saying that
her clash last week with party leaders over her plan to hold a
fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion had already focused ``too much
press'' on her and the party.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who represents the 46th Congressional District of
California, just south of Los Angeles, and is a co-chairwoman of
the Democratic National Committee, reluctantly agreed Friday to
shift the event from the mansion to a Universal Studios site after
angry convention planners revoked her invitation to address the
Tuesday session. She then was restored to the speakers list.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders had warned her that if a party official of her
high rank presided over a fund-raiser in a Playboy hangout, the
party's efforts to portray itself as the party of ``family values''
rather than the party of sex scandals would be set back
immeasurably. She resisted, arguing that the event was already sold
out, but eventually gave in when Vice President Al Gore and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, let it be known that they,
too, disapproved of the mansion site.
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners figured that was the end of the matter. But
Monday morning, Sanchez surprised them by requesting that her name
again be struck from the speakers list. On second thought, she
said, it would be best for her to stay out of the convention
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was totally unexpected and a big disappointment to all of
us,'' said Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic
National Committee. ``We had been planning to give her a rousing
welcome from the floor, complete with signs and banners. She's one
of our rising stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who is Hispanic, represents a heavily Hispanic district
and her fund-raiser, scheduled for Tuesday, will raise money to be
used to get out the increasingly important, mostly Democratic
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing her withdrawal as a convention speaker, Sanchez said
Monday morning during an interview with Fox News that it was not
true that she had shifted the fund-raiser to the Universal Studios
site because she feared losing a speaking spot. Rather, she
insisted, she made the move to avoid more adverse publicity for
both herself and the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved it away, `` she said, ``because it was getting too
much press, versus what we really have to do here at the
convention. In fact, that is one of the reasons why I won't be
speaking at this convention.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJIBOUTI _ The sultan of the Jews in Somalia is a handsome,
silver-haired man named Ahmed Jama Hersi who does not know the
first thing about Judaism. He is a Muslim, as were his ancestors
back at least 800 years. But he and his people are treated badly,
cursed as descendants of Israelites. The name of the tribe is
Yibir, or Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even our young people,'' he said here the other day, ``they
are ashamed when you ask them what tribe they belong to. They will
not say Yibir.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much is known about the lineage of the Yibir, one of
Somalia's ``sab,'' or outcast, clans. But if Somalis succeed in
creating a new central government _ as they have been trying to do
since March _ the Yibir will for the first time taste political
legitimacy and respect. In the 225-member assembly envisioned for a
new Somalia, the Yibir get one seat.
</P>
<P>
   A conscious effort is being made to broaden political power in
Somalia, traditionally held by old men from the four major clans.
In the new assembly, women, the bedrock of Somali economic and
family life, have been allocated 25 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Minority clans like the Yibir, Midgan and Tomal will have 24
seats, if the assembly is ever translated from a nice idea at a
peace conference here in neighboring Djibouti to an actual
government in Somalia, which has been without one since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most broad-based process that Somalia has ever
known,'' said David Stephen, the representative of Kofi Annan, the
U.N. secretary general, at the peace talks. ``Never before have
women and minorities taken part in discussions about their
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this means anything. It is far from
certain that any new government will ever actually sit in Somalia,
though hopes are high. Perhaps more important is whether the
elderly men from the major clans will cede any of their authority.
Some men, according to Stephen, bluntly say that they ``are only
doing this to please the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   But still the minority groups, who prefer to be called the
Alliance, and women are talking about the power they theoretically
hold if they vote as a bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The top positions in any new government are likely to be doled
out to the major clans, and any clan that makes alliances with the
women and minorities in the assembly is more likely to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have one voice and one interest as women,'' said
Asha Haji Elmi, leader of the women delegates to the conference.
She conceded that there would be pressure for women to vote with
their clans rather than as women. Twenty of the women's seats are
assigned to the four major clans and the remaining five to the
minority clans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' she said, ``but we have to overcome the
obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, at any rate, a high-minded exercise, pushed strongly by
the peace conference's host, President Ismael Omar Gelleh of
Djibouti. Still, Somalis are quick to point out that Gelleh's own
government is not nearly so liberal as his vision for Somalia's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in our tradition,'' said Mahmoud Imam Omar, an elder
in one of the major clans, the Hawiye, speaking of the inclusion of
women. ``President Gelleh has made us do it. But we have accepted
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Somali businessman, Muhammad Ali Muhammad, said it was an
experiment worth trying. ``We have seen how the men have devastated
the country,'' he said. ``So maybe the women and minority groups
would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   A new government is, of course, no guarantee of equality. Then
again, the Yibir do not have much to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Hersi, 68, who has been the elected leader of the Yibir for 22
years, was asked to speak at one of the opening sessions of the
peace conference two months ago. He noted that the Yibir had
suffered terribly during the years of war but wanted badly to
forgive and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the civil war I lost my son, my wife, my brother, my
dignity and my self-respect,'' he told the delegates. ``But still I
have come here to work for reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the bad treatment, he concedes, is the support of many
Yibir for the dictator Muhammad Siad Barre. When he was overthrown
in 1991, Hersi fled the country with surviving members of his
family to live in Nairobi, Kenya's capital.
</P>
<P>
   But part of it is simply that they are one of the low castes of
Somalis, and particularly that they are believed to be ethnic Jews
in a strongly Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never given our rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many years the Yibir were forbidden to be educated, and
Hersi says he can barely spell his name. They do work that is
considered to be base, like metalworking and shoemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally many earned money through the Somali belief,
stretching back perhaps centuries, that it is lucky to give the
Yibir a small amount of money when a son is born or at a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Hersi cannot say exactly how or when his ancestors made it to
Somalia, though he believes that about 25,000 Yibir live there and
in neighboring countries like Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya. Stories
passed down from his forefathers have it that they came as
Arabic-speaking teachers more than 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no relation between them and the Jews of
neighboring Ethiopia, many of whom still practice Judaism. It is
hard to say exactly how the Yibir are Jews, or why they treated so
badly because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yibir not only know nothing about Judaism, but they also say
they have no intention of converting or, like the Ethiopian Jews,
seeking resettlement in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would only make more problems,'' said another Yibir,
Muhammad Ali Hassan, a trader in the emirate of Dubai on the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The process of getting their one seat has been typically
difficult. Hersi said he had never received an invitation even to
come to the conference, though he made it here two months ago with
the help of the United Nations. In negotiations with other outcast
clans, the Yibir originally were given two seats in Parliament, but
a few days ago, one was stripped from them. Still, he said, one
seat is a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we had nothing,'' he said. ``This is the beginning, the
first step.''

took charge of Pearson PLC _ a British publisher whose holdings
include Penguin Books, The Economist, The Financial Times and a
major educational publishing operation _ Marjorie Scardino has
overhauled the formerly sleepy company, engineering major
acquisitions and asset sales as well as smaller deals. The result,
Scardino contends, is a media company poised for growth by
extending its books, newspapers and magazines into online,
interactive communications. But the dizzying pace of change has
made it difficult for even sophisticated analysts to gauge the
impact of the makeover. By Geraldine Fabrikant.

DEMOCRATIC SENATE PRIMARY IN WASHINGTON JUST STARTING TO HEAT UP 
</HEADLINE>
  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It may be a stretch to say that Washington state
Democrats are paying rapt attention to next month's U.S. Senate
primary, in which the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn,
and former U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell, now a wealthy Internet
executive citing her experience in the ``new economy,'' are
battling for the right to take on the three-term Republican
incumbent, Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Senn arrived here the other evening for a campaign
speech to an electricians' union that had already endorsed her,
several of the electricians said they could not name the candidates
in the Sept. 19 primary, and they also labored a bit to identify
the issues they considered most pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really going to focus on that till it's closer to the
time to go out and vote,'' explained one electrician.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Ed Pecotte, 57, seemed to sum up the mood of many at
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, when he said:
``People are working, the economy seems to be humming along pretty
well. I'd like to hear how these candidates intend to help things
keep rolling along.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a clear sense on the campaign trail that voters are just
starting to concentrate on the race, the Democratic match-up shows
signs of becoming an intriguing and bitterly fought contest. And
the Washington Senate race is one that some national Democrats view
as a prime opportunity in the party's battle to take back control
of the Senate, where Republicans have a 54 to 46 edge.
</P>
<P>
   For Cantwell and Senn, the primary is the standard double-edged
sword of such contests: The candidates will likely create a lot of
publicity as the primary grows nearer but also risk draining their
resources and energy in the battle, with the victor having barely a
month and a half to shift gears for the main bout against the
well-financed Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Senn got into the contest early, after several potential
Democratic heavyweights, including Gov. Gary Locke, state Attorney
General Christine Gregoire and King County Executive Ron Sims, all
took a pass on the race. (Locke is running for re-election, and
Gregoire and Sims, who lost to Gorton six years ago, seem to be
interested in running for his job later.)
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Senn has racked up dozens of endorsements from
labor groups, lawmakers and others, and frequently points out that
she has won statewide races twice with more than 1 million votes,
more than Gorton has received in any of his six statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   Cantwell, on the other hand, enjoys the advantage of the
millions of dollars she has earned as a software executive at Real
Networks here and, in some ways, getting booted out of Congress
after one term in the 1994 Republican tide could turn out to be the
best thing that ever happened to her politically. The former
congresswoman, 41, has vowed to spend ``whatever it takes'' to
unseat Gorton, 72, and also says she has ``real world''
private-sector experience with the Internet economy that, she says,
makes her a stronger candidate than if she had stayed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Under Washington's unusual ``blanket primary'' system, all
candidates for Senate, including Gorton, will be on the ballot
Sept. 19, with the top vote-getter among Democrats, regardless of
her percentage, surviving to face the incumbent on the November
ballot. Any third-party candidate who receives more than 1 percent
of the primary vote also makes the general election. This will
almost surely be the last year Washington uses such a system,
though: After a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June threw out a
similar primary system in California that was open to all voters,
state officials here are virtually certain to change the rules to
withstand a similar challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Cantwell has already been on the air with a series of television
advertisements, describing her background and pledging to fight for
ways to control the costs of prescription drugs, an issue that has
emerged here, as in other states, as a major concern for many
voters, especially older ones. With stock options estimated to be
worth at least $10 million and a declared willingness to spend her
own money, the former congresswoman is likely to be firmly fixed in
voters' minds by next month. And, for the moment anyway, she seems
to be all but ignoring Senn, explaining that only she can win by
making a much larger impression on the voters, rather than by
dissecting her primary opponent's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as a huge task of a cynical public that really
doesn't want to hear too much about politics,'' Cantwell explained
the other day after a campaign event in which she had appeared with
Helen Jackson, the widow of Sen. Henry M. Jackson, to support an
increase in federal conservation funds. ``So my challenge is bigger
than Deborah Senn and Slade Gorton,'' Cantwell says. ``It's
convincing the public that you can make a difference in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Senn said she has been battling insurance companies and fighting
for lower drug costs for years in her state post, and scoffed at
Cantwell's interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with all that, with all the work we've done, I'm faced
with Maria Cantwell on the air spending a million bucks, telling
people she's going to solve their prescription drug problems,''
Senn said in an interview this week, after speaking to the
electricians' union. ``There's no record behind that ad. It is a
promise, not performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cantwell said she has a record in Congress on all kinds of
health-care issues, and she has also made computer privacy a
campaign issue, noting that she was a prime player in 1994 in
fighting Clinton administration proposals, later dropped, that
privacy advocates feared could increase government surveillance of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Senn has attacked that stance, noting that Real Networks itself
got into hot water a few years ago after it emerged that one of its
software programs could store information on customers'
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``A privacy pledge from Maria Cantwell is like having Jesse
James promote bank security,'' Senn said.
</P>
<P>
   While differing in some respects on free trade _ Cantwell was a
strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, while
Senn has said she would probably not have voted for the accord in
the form that came before Congress _ the candidates agree on many
other issues. And they both identify health care, education and the
environment as major campaign themes. For that matter, so does
Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Gorton, who has been in public life almost
continuously for more than 30 years, is more conservative than most
Washington residents and thus vulnerable to an upset this November.
He has failed to get a 50 percent approval rating in some polls,
another sign of hope for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the candidates' support at this juncture is tricky,
since voters are just starting to pay attention and Senn, who has
raised $1.6 million and will likely have less to spend than
Cantwell, has yet to start running television ads. The Democratic
candidates are not scheduled to debate until next month. One
statewide poll last month of 400 registered voters by Stuart Elway,
an independent pollster who is not working for any candidate in the
race, found 21 percent supporting Cantwell and 12 percent for Senn,
with 42 percent for Gorton and most of the rest undecided.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates do have at least one thing in common: they
were raised in the Midwest. If Gorton loses, Patty Murray, a
Democrat, will become the senior senator and Washington will become
the third state, after California and Maine, to have two women in
the Senate. Just over 40 percent of state lawmakers are women, the
highest percentage in any state Legislature in the nation's
history.

   RUSSIA-TRAPPED-SAILORS (Moscow) _ More than 100 Russian sailors
were trapped at the bottom of the sea above the Arctic Circle with
little hope of rescue after their nuclear submarine was seriously
damaged in a collision, the commander of Russia's navy said. The
navy said it had begun a rescue effort in the Barents Sea on
Monday. In the early hours of Tuesday the navy was using small subs
to both inspect the damaged vessel and try to replenish the crew's
oxygen. Rescuers planned to attempt to evacuate the crew sometime
Tuesday, an effort that is expected to be complicated by the
extreme pressure that exists at the depth where the sub is lodged,
approximately 480 feet below the ocean surface. By Sabrina

COMMENTARY: AL GORE MARCHES IN 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore has been hovering outside California
waiting for the Clintons to depart, like a host tapping his foot at
the door while the longest-winded guest at the party launches into
one last anecdote by the coat rack. But now the convention is his,
his, his, and we are going to hear more about Gore over the next
three days than you might have thought humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major topics of speculation has been how many times
the organizers can manage to remind voters that Gore served in
Vietnam, unlike some presidential candidates we could name. The
answer, it appears, is around fifteen jillion. They are, in fact,
planning to devote an entire day to the salute to Vietnam veterans.
Did we mention that Gore volunteered?
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has so far failed to attract the great droves of
female voters a Democrat needs to get elected president, is going
for lots and lots and lots of women on the podium. And more power
to him. As the candidate himself pointed out the other day, he was
raised to believe ``that men and women are equal, if not more so.''
</P>
<P>
   However, we are definitely not going to hear from Jane Fee, a
73-year-old World War II veteran who is also the nation's first
openly transgender delegate. Despite the Minnesota delegation's
efforts to interest the convention in Fee's story, she failed to
make the publicity machine's list of interesting delegates. The
party apparently felt we'd be more fascinated by ``an independent
family farmer whose family lives and works without health
insurance'' or a ``Texas state representative who is familiar with
the Children's Health Program.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of this week absolutely nothing is going to happen
here without the assistance of a famous entertainer. Gore began his
march to the convention by introducing Joe Lieberman _ have we
pointed out that he is the first Jewish candidate for vice
president? _ with the help of the pop star Jewel, who is the proud
owner of several platinum records and her own humanitarian
foundation that attempts ``to inspire positive change on global,
community and individual levels.'' The vice president spent part of
last weekend in Ohio with Rob Reiner, who is trying to burnish
Gore's reputation as a fun guy. At the convention (which features a
health care symposium led by Jimmy Smits), his name will be put in
nomination by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones was Gore's roommate at
Harvard, a school he attended shortly before he went into the Army,
where he served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not, of course, as close to the entertainment community
as the Clintons are, but then the Clintons did not serve in Vietnam
or pick Joseph Lieberman as their running mate. The president and
first lady spent days here being feted and donated to by the
Hollywood community. This is one of those aspects of being a
politician that sounds like more fun than it actually is. If
Clinton gets elected to the Senate, she will have paid for it with
the night she sat listening to Paul Anka sing a salute to the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   As he wandered around town from one event to the next, the
president was also a perpetual reminder of how much better he is at
this game than his vice president, his wife or anybody else. At an
event sponsored by several Jewish organizations at the Sony studios
(where Clinton was unfortunately positioned right in front of a
billboard for the movie ``Hollow Man''), he gave a foreign policy
talk of really exquisite pitch. Like Mario Cuomo in his prime,
Clinton can make the members of a large audience feel as if they're
sitting in his living room after dinner, having a great
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Now all eyes turn to Gore, a man who can make people sitting in
his living room after dinner feel as if they're in a large
audience, taking notes. From now on, the convention is going to be
made in the vice president's image. There will be a lot of issues
and many themes. Vietnam veterans' day will be Thursday, which is
also ``visions of the future'' day, which is not to be confused
with ``the promises of tomorrow'' day, which happens to be Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   We're moving into new territory. The old order passed Monday
night with Bill Clinton's farewell speech. The next president,
whoever he is, is not likely to shock, appall, mystify or interest
us the way this one did.
</P>
<P>
   We're gonna miss the big guy. Just you wait.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Latino Committee 2000 Sunday brunch at
Paramount Studios included almost every top California Hispanic
politician, but was notable for one no-show: Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The second-term congresswoman from Orange County was on the list
of invited VIPs to the lavish event, which featured chicken
tamales, music by the band Culture Clash, and speeches on the
influence of Hispanics in politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez, criticized by the Democratic National Committee
over her plans for a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion, has kept a
low profile since the issue went public last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 40, caved in Friday and announced she was moving the
fund-raiser to B.B. King's Blues Club at Universal Studios'
CityWalk, a touristy street of restaurants and shops. In return,
Democratic leaders canceled their threats to consider ousting her
as the highest ranking woman in the Democratic Party. Sanchez is
co-chair of the Democratic National Committee, along with Detroit
Mayor Dennis Archer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been about the Playboy Mansion,'' she said Friday.
``It's about putting on a good event and raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the flap has brought successive waves of criticism for
Sanchez, who gained national attention in 1996 when she narrowly
beat incumbent Rep. Bob Dornan, a conservative Republican. First,
party leaders said the Playboy event could embarrass Vice President
Al Gore, then others criticized her for caving in to the moralists
and moving the event.
</P>
<P>
   Several people attending Sunday's brunch at the Paramount
Studios lot in Hollywood said they strongly support Sanchez,
despite the criticism. And few thought the flap would have any
lasting effect on the Democrats' popularity with Hispanic voters at
the polls in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalinda Guillen, political director of the United Farm Workers
in Sacramento, said she saw nothing wrong with Sanchez's Playboy
Mansion fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she doesn't apologize,'' she said. ``What does she have
to apologize for?''
</P>
<P>
   When Sanchez initially refused to move the fund-raiser, DNC
Chairman Joe Andrew stripped her of her scheduled speaking role at
the convention and threatened her position as a party co-chair. By
moving the event, she regained her speaking slot, although on
Monday she said she would not address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ``had to do whatever is in keeping with the tone (of the
convention), but I think it's unfortunate that it happened to
Loretta, who is a star,'' said Carmen Delgado Votaw, a Maryland
delegate to the convention. Votaw said Sanchez made the right
decision to move the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was flexible in order to stay in the game,'' she said.
``She wanted some of the limelight at this convention _ and she
deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanics believed that the national party officials
unfairly singled out Sanchez, noting that Playboy magazine founder
Hugh Hefner and his daughter, Christie, have donated money to the
Democrats and to the campaigns of President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all posturing for the conservative vote,'' said
Esai Morales, an actor who starred in the movie ``La Bamba.'' ``If
you can take money from Hugh Hefner, you shouldn't be hypocritical
about having an event at his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Hinojosa, an economics professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said Hispanics view the Sanchez-DNC feud
as a serious matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very sensitive to how national Latino politicians
are treated,'' he said. ``We haven't been in the spotlight that
long, so we wonder when we see this ton of bricks come down on
Loretta.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hinojosa said the event at Hefner's estate,
coming during the Democratic convention, would only have fed
Republican attacks. ``Everyone would probably agree that
politically it was not a very smart thing to do,'' he said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian Orthodox Church on Monday announced the
canonization of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his immediate
family for their ``meekness'' and ``poise'' when they were
imprisoned and executed by the Bolsheviks 82 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The elevation of the last czar to sainthood has long been
demanded by powerful right-wing factions in the church and had been
the subject of considerable debate and controversy. The decision,
which had been anticipated for several weeks, was made behind
closed doors by Patriarch Alexy II and the church's 150 hierarchs,
sitting as the Council of Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the intense debate preceding the canonization, the
bishops did not proclaim the Romanovs as ``martyrs,'' or those who
died specifically for their Christian convictions,'' but instead
declared them ``passion bearers,'' a category used to identify
believers who died as victims of evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last Russian Orthodox monarch and in the members of his
family we see people who sincerely sought to live by the
commandments of the Gospels,'' reads the council's decision in a
statement distributed by the church press service.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops also canonized 860 others who were killed by the
Bolsheviks, many of them priests and monks, as martyrs and
``confessors of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The council has sanctified as passion bearers among the throng
of new martyrs and confessors of the faith, the Russian Emperor
Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra, Czarevitch Alexei, Princesses Olga,
Tatyana, Maria, and Anastasia,'' the church's press service
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The formal services will take place on Sunday at the Church of
Christ the Savior, an imposing cathedral near the Kremlin that was
rebuilt in recent years on the site of a church destroyed on
Stalin's orders in 1931. The canonization of the last imperial
family came two years after remains identified as those of
Nicholas, his wife and three children, along with four servants who
were killed with them, were buried in in St. Petersburg. The
remains were exhumed from a forest grave outside Yekaterinburg in
1991 and identified after DNA testing. The remains of two other
children were never found.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian church has not recognized these remains as belonging
to the czar, and neither Patriarch Alexy nor any other bishop
attended the simple interment.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanovs were executed 16 months after Nicholas abdicated
the throne on March 15, 1917, as revolutionary fervor swept Russia.
He and his family were detained by the Bolsheviks and eventually
sent to Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains, where on July 17,
1918, they were shot dead in the basement of a merchant's house by
a squad of Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication whether President Vladimir
Putin would attend the formal canonization rites. Putin has not
made his position on the canonization known, though there has been
speculation in the Russian press that he supports the act for its
powerful political symbolism. Putin's first months in office have
been marked by efforts to restore central authority to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a strong guy, and Nicholas II is a representative of
a strong empire and this canonization would be a canonization of a
strong empire, not of Nicholas II only,'' said Edvard S. Radzinsky,
author of ``The Life and Death of Nicholas II'' (Doubleday, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   As president Putin has demonstrated some loyalty to the Russian
church. One of his first public appearances as acting president was
at Christmas services in January at the Cathedral of Christ the
Savior, where the council is being held and where the canonization
service will take place next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Juvenaly, the hierarch in charge of the commission
on canonization, reported that the cases of each of the potential
martyrs and confessors of the Soviet era were studied individually.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were clergymen and church workers killed in 1937 and
1938, the worst years of persecution against the church. In 1937,
136,900 churchmen were arrested and 85,300 were executed by the
NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB. Of the 28,300 arrested in 1938,
21,500 were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas II and his family have, in fact, been canonized before,
by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, in New York City,
which canonized the Romanovs as martyrs. But the New York church
does not acknowledge the Russian church and itself is not
recognized by other Orthodox churches. Many believers in Russia
admired its decision, however.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially divisive debate over the imperial family was
predicted before the bishops' council opened on Sunday. Two icons
of the new saints were reportedly prepared, one with the czar and
his family, and one without their images.

DEMONSTRATORS CLASH WITH POLICE DURING PROTEST AGAINST GORE &HT;    By MARK HELM
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About 600 environmental protesters marching on the
opening day of the Democratic National Convention here clashed with
police Monday during a demonstration targeting Al Gore's ties to
Occidental Petroleum Corp., which plans to drill for oil on land in
Colombia claimed by an indigenous tribe.
</P>
<P>
   After a rally across the street from the Staples Center, site of
the convention, the protesters _ holding 30-foot papier mache
puppets and chanting, ``Al Gore, Reject Big Oil'' _ began marching
under the watchful eye of several hundred police in riot gear
toward Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks from the square, about a third of the marchers
stopped at an intersection. Police warned them to move along to
allow traffic to flow. When they refused, the police charged with
their batons and began pushing the protesters up the street toward
the square. After about 15 minutes and 10 arrests, the protesters
backed off and rejoined the march.
</P>
<P>
   Beka Economopoulos, speaking for the D2KLA, an umbella group
that helped organize the protests, accused the police of
overreacting. ``Our people were completely nonviolent, and yet the
police attacked them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But police spokeswoman Donna Danko said the officers used
``appropriate force'' to keep the streets clear. ``Considering the
taunts and attitude of the protesters, our officers used
extraordinary restraint,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The march was the latest in a series of protests that have
followed Gore throughout his presidential campaign. The
demonstrators want him to denounce the company's Colombia plans and
shed his family's shares of Occidental, which he valued at $500,000
and $1 million on his May 22 public financial disclosure report.
Gore has refused.
</P>
<P>
   The stock originally belonged to Gore's father, onetime Sen.
Albert Gore Sr., D-Tenn., who in 1972, two years after leaving the
Senate, became chairman of an Occidental subsidiary, Island Creek
Coal, earning a $500,000 annual salary. He died in 1998 and left
the shares in a trust for Al Gore's mother Pauline. Gore, as
executor of the trust, has control of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials could not be reached for comment, but in
the past the vice president has said that the stock belongs to his
mother and not him.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based Occidental has fought for nine years to
begin drilling on land in Colombia's Andes Mountains, which experts
say holds as much as 1.3 billion barrels of oil. But an indigenous
tribe, the U'wa, claims the land belongs to it. Leaders of the
5,000-member tribe contend that the drilling would would bring
environmental disaster and the demise of their culture. In 1997,
the leaders vowed to walk off a 1,400-foot cliff if Occidental
drills on the land.
</P>
<P>
   The issue threatens to embarrass Gore, whose campaign has
focused on his history as an environmentalist.``The guy is a total
hypocrite,'' said Tim Roacher, 19, a student from Portland, Ore.,
who held a sign reading, ``Gore, Oxy out of U'wa land.'' ``He says
that he's for the environment, but when no one is looking, he does
what they all do, which is take the money.''
</P>
<P>
   More protests were scheduled for Monday, including one entitled
``Billionaires for Bush (or Gore).'' A concert by the band Rage
Against the Machine was also set to be held across the street from
the Staples Center, which is protected by hundreds of officers and
a 13-foot concrete fence.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's march was considerably smaller than a demonstration
Sunday, in which more than 3,500 protesters jammed downtown streets
in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a Pennsylvania death row inmate
convicted on killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981.

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: GOP IN THE ENEMY'S LAIR
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seen threading his way through a bevy of Democrats
at their annual convention: Republican National Chairman Jim
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson has taken on the role of ``rapid-response attack dog''
in responding to the Democrats' sallies. But he also made some
now-it-can-be-told news of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a reporter's query, he confirmed that the
Republicans chose Philadelphia as the site of their 2000 convention
to pre-empt the Democrats from holding their convention there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if we hadn't have moved, Al Gore would have gone to
Philadelphia,'' Nicholson said. ``Pennsylvania is in play in
November. Fortunately, we got to pick first.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Democrats could have trailed the GOP parade into
the City of Brotherly Love. Both major parties held their
conventions there in 1948. But the city's host committee, led by
former Philadelphia mayor (and current Democratic general chairman)
Ed Rendell, had only enough money in the till to support one such
mega-event.
</P>
<P>
   From delegates to media, most people here complain about how
little access they have to the convention floor, the hot parties
and the celebrities who attend them.
</P>
<P>
   Not Aaron Harber. If anything, he's got too much access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get double invitations to everything,'' Huber sighed Sunday
night, knee-deep in celebrities at a party sponsored by People for
the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harber is a triple threat here. The host of a Boulder,
Colo., TV show, ``Spontaneous Combustion,'' Harber may be the only
person at this convention _ or any other, in fact _ who is a
credentialed member of the media, a delegate (from Colorado for
Gore) and a member of the electoral college.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a delegate twice before, for Gary Hart in 1984 and
Bill Clinton in 1996. He has figured out how to use his power here
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have unlimited floor privileges and I'm going to abuse
them,'' Harber said with a grin. ``I'll use them about half the
time and then share them with alternates, friends and anyone
willing to pay $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a pleasant outdoor lunch at a Santa Monica watering hole,
Arianna Huffington, chief organizer of the so-called Shadow
Conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, wondered why Sen. Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., co-author of the McCain-Feingold campaign reform
bill, wasn't speaking at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she noted, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had also
spoken to her group, got a prime-time slot in Philadelphia. And had
not Al Gore recently pledged to make the McCain-Feingold bill ``the
very first piece of legislation I will submit to Congress'' as
president?
</P>
<P>
   Her lunch companion suggested Feingold hadn't exactly helped his
standing with party regulars by coming before Huffington's group
Sunday and blasting the upcoming convention, which is being
</P>
<P>
   held just down the street, as (along with the Republicans) as
``the worst display of money and corruption in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been saying that while George Bush may outshine
Al Gore on the personality meter, when it comes to the issues
voters care about most, Gore will come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is not an instinctive politician,'' Stan Greenberg, the
prospective nominee's official pollster for strategic planning,
told reporters Monday. ``I have no doubt he'll be heard on the
issues, but it won't be as easy as it is for a more glib
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's most recent national poll, taken Aug. 8-10, found
Gore running nine points behind Bush _ about mid-range in the
current basket of presidential match-ups. Perhaps more significant
</P>
<P>
   was the poll's list of issues that prospective voters think the
government should deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Eight: education (20 percent), moral n the Democratic
ticket made a highly-publicized stop in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``His priorities right now are the bases this week and spending
as much time as possible on policy and getting up to speed,'' Dent
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party officials won't be able to seat an alternate to
substitute for the absent Miller, who toured Fort Stewart in
Hinesville on Monday and was scheduled for trips to Augusta's Fort
Gordon and Warner Robins Air Force Base on Tuesday and Thursday.

<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Afrim and his family have been on
the move through the ruins of their former country for three years
now, often living apart, unable to find one place where they can
live together safely. Victims of their mixed blood and their own
mixed marriage, Afrim and Safeta are each half Albanian and half
Serbian from Kosovo, as are their two children, Rina, 13, and Rron,
11.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat both in Kosovo and in the rest of Serbia, they have
found refuge in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, which was itself
torn apart in a nationalist war. Her parents are in Croatia; his
father is buried in Kosovo's capital and his mother is in Belgrade,
Serbia's capital. The family is scattered to the corners of the old
Yugoslavia, embodying its official creed of an ethnic harmony they
can no longer live out anywhere on its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an irony to end up here,'' said Afrim, sitting in their
rented rooms in a modest house on one of Sarajevo's steep
hillsides. ``But for the moment, it is the best place for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary of their Balkan odyssey, Afrim and Safeta have joined a
growing list of families of mixed marriages drifting to Sarajevo to
seek help from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees to
emigrate. They are hoping to go to Canada, but _ still uncertain of
their fate _ they asked that their surname not be published, nor
their faces shown in a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Both 34, they were high-school sweethearts and married at 19
while still students in the Kosovo capital, Pristina. He studied
law and she Yugoslav literature, and they worked together on the
student magazine. Afrim began work as a journalist and Safeta as a
teacher, just as Kosovo plunged into turbulent years that began
when Slobodan Milosevic came to power in Serbia in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed marriages _ reasonably common in many parts of the former
Yugoslavia, and often complex and bitter after war began in 1991 _
were relatively rare in Kosovo, where Serbs and Albanians had
already come to live almost completely separate lives. When such
unions did occur, they were usually among the educated elite.
</P>
<P>
   Afrim's father was Albanian, a lawyer and manager of one of
Pristina's banks. After he died in 1991, Afrim's mother, a Serb,
was urged by her sons to leave Kosovo. She is now living in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Afrim and his brother, Agim, 39, grew up bilingual, speaking
Albanian with their father and Serbian with their mother. But their
looks and name are Albanian. Agim had trained as a doctor but had
difficulty finding work in Pristina. And, in 1990, after Serbia
stripped Kosovo of its autonomy and drove many Albanians from their
state jobs in the province, Afrim lost his job at Radio TV
Pristina. Many Albanians were expelled; others chose to quit their
state employment. Afrim, unlike most others, later wanted to
return, and was allowed to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Safeta's Albanian father is a former Yugoslav diplomat, living
now with her Serbian mother on the coast of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Safeta grew up speaking only Serbian _ or Serbo-Croat, as the
language was then known _ and when asked how she regards her
nationality, she calls herself Yugoslav, even though the larger
Yugoslavia of her childhood has ceased to exist. Kosovo has become
a dangerous place for her because the mere act of speaking Serbian
can invite a violent attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, as ethnic Albanian rebels took up arms against the
Serbian security forces, Afrim moved his family to Turkey.
``Knowing what had happened in Bosnia and Croatia,'' he said,
referring to the wars of the early 1990's in which parts of the
former Yugoslavia became independent countries, ``I knew it would
be the same in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But Afrim's brother, Agim, was caught in Pristina, and escaped
thanks only to some Serbian colleagues at the hospital where he
worked. He went to Belgrade and eventually crossed on foot into
Bosnia, where Afrim and his family joined him. Together, they began
to seek a way out of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Kosovo war ended and NATO forces swept into the
province, Afrim knew there was no place there for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already trying to find a third country to go to,'' he
said. ``It was obvious what was going to happen in Kosovo,'' he
added, referring to the return of Kosovo Albanians who make up the
province's majority, and who wanted revenge against the Serbs whose
police officers and soldiers had rampaged through the land, killing
and expelling Albanians and destroying their villages.
</P>
<P>
   The family's savings were running out and they went to stay with
Safeta's parents in Croatia. But the visa they now need to stay in
a country that was once part of their own ran out. They returned to
Afrim's mother in Belgrade, where Safeta managed to get a job in a
shop.
</P>
<P>
   But Afrim was arrested three times by the Serbian police. Once
he was hauled off a bus, handcuffed and interrogated for 12 hours.
Another time the police came for him when he was drinking coffee
with his mother in her kitchen. He was told that, like all males
from Kosovo, he was forbidden to work in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So he left the family in Belgrade and went to Kosovo, where he
found work at a multiethnic radio station run by the United
Nations. He makes light of his situation there, although being half
Serbian made it precarious. ``Only once a colleague said I was a
traitor,'' he said. Safeta came to visit and wanted to bring the
children, but found all their old neighbors had gone and the
neighborhood had changed. ``She was afraid to go out and I was
working,'' Afrim said. ``It just wasn't possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The children at least could go to school in Belgrade and
encountered no prejudice from their teachers, Afrim said. Yet they
lived with a lurking fear. Rron, a solid, earnest boy who loves
computers and drawing, speaks only Serbian in Belgrade and said
firmly he did not care if he never went back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Serbia he seems to fear being discovered as half
Albanian. ``My friends think I am a Turk,'' he said proudly. Then
he whispered to his father: ``A boy at school said once, `It's good
that you are from Turkey.' He meant that if I was Albanian, he
would kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rina, at 13, is more sure of herself. She has the dark striking
looks of an Albanian, but her Serbian is fluent and she appears
fearless. She preferred her Albanian friends in Kosovo because they
were warmer, she said, but she has lots of Serbian friends too.
Both children already speak English and say they want to become
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Agim has already left for Canada with his Serbian fiancee.
Safeta's sister is also preparing to leave with her family. Their
main concern is that the children do not have to grow up in a
society warped by nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for the best, so they do not have to live under the
pressure whether they are Albanian, Serbs, Muslims or whatever,''
Afrim said. ``When you live in the Balkans you cannot live without
thinking about your background.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a collective way of thinking,'' he went on. ``There is no
individualism. Maybe we were lucky; because of our mixed marriage,
we can see it more clearly. But on the other hand, if you think
like that, you cannot live here.''

   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ In a flash preview Monday of his upcoming
convention speech, Vice President Al Gore plunged into some of the
details of how he would shore up Medicare and Social Security and
suggested that Gov. George W. Bush was hiding behind generalities
because his tax-cut proposal would cut benefits and hurt other
programs like community policing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is hoping that his speech on Thursday, when he accepts the
Democratic nomination for president, will accomplish a couple of
things _ give him a political mandate to follow the course he is
proposing, and portray the Republicans as speaking vaguely because
their positions are unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give generalities and not give the specifics _ that's not
the best way to elevate our democracy,'' the vice president said
during a discussion with senior citizens Monday at a forum here in
Harry Truman's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers say these discussions, while not exciting,
address the concerns of ordinary Americans and play to Gore's
strengths, including his grasp of policy, and at the same time
suggest that Bush is unprepared to grapple with such basic issues.
Gore has opposed Bush's broad tax-cut proposal, saying it would
force the government to cut back on various programs like Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely they're worried that the American people won't agree
with them because otherwise they'd give you the specifics,'' Gore
said as he described Bush's proposal to allow people to invest some
of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market and to
grant a $1.3 trillion tax cut over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going to make up a trillion dollars over the
next 10 years?'' Gore asked of Bush's tax-cut proposal. ``That's a
fundamental question. And it's not a partisan question. It's a
question that the American people have a right to get an answer
to.''
</P>
<P>
   As he looked toward his convention, Gore also sought to place
himself in the populist Democratic tradition of presidents Franklin
D. Roosevelt, who signed Social Security into law on Aug. 14, 1935,
and Truman, who first argued for Medicare, which President Lyndon
Johnson signed into law in Independence on July 30, 1965, in honor
of Truman.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore seemed to gain inspiration during his discussion
of specifics versus generalities from a 1936 speech by Roosevelt.
In that speech, delivered at a state Democratic party convention in
Syracuse, N.Y., Roosevelt referred to the ``smooth evasion'' of the
Republicans, who hated his social programs but knew the public
liked them.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the quotation from Roosevelt, Gore declared,
``Well, he had their number, didn't he?'' and the audience of about
200 seniors burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people on the other ticket are good men,'' Gore asserted.
``I'll never attack them personally. But I do think the American
people deserve to know the specifics about how the American people
would be affected if the other side won, how the American people
will be affected if we win,'' he said, in a careful shift from the
subjunctive when speaking of a Republican win and a more certain
future tense when projecting a Democratic win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here's what I want to do,'' Gore said. ``I want to extend
the life of Social Security, I do not want to cut benefits, I do
want the kinds of reforms that make sense, using the trust fund to
help pay down the debt and make big savings in the interest we have
to pay on that debt. I want to extend the life of the Medicare
trust fund through a similar approach, and I want to add a
prescription drug benefit for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``I will take the Medicare trust fund and the Social
Security trust fund and put them in an ironclad lock box with a
sign that says, `Politicians, hands off! That's to be used only for
Social Security and Medicare and not for anything else! Hands
off!'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore traveled later in the day to St. Louis, where he was
holding a rally with his vice presidential running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, and their wives before watching President
Clinton's valedictory speech at the convention in Los Angeles.

PROGRESSIVES WARN GORE OF NADER THREAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DAN FREEDMAN
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leaders of the liberal wing of the Democratic
Party on Monday said Vice President Al Gore must start making
distinctions between his policy proposals and those of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush or risk losing liberal voters to Green Party
insurgent Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting of liberal activists on the Democratic
National Convention's opening day, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
offered a warning to Gore: Start emphasizing hard differences
between himself and Bush on such issues as higher wages, health
care, Social Security, or liberal voters might look more seriously
at Nader, the veteran consumer rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president ... has got to speak to these economic
issues,'' Wellstone told the group of 100 activists. ``There are a
lot of people I see right now voting for Ralph Nader and I don't
think they should be taken lightly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think we need to come out of this convention with
a strong speech that speaks directly to these bread-and-butter
economic issues that are so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Bush's strength in the polls, Wellstone and other
liberals indicated they are willing to overlook their own policy
differences with Gore in order to prevent a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be persuaded that the differences make a
difference,'' said Wellstone, referring to Gore and Bush. ``I think
George W. would repeal the 20th Century if he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences between liberals and Gore are significant. Liberals,
who now refer to themselves as ``progressives,'' oppose the death
penalty but Gore supports it. They oppose the overhaul of welfare
requiring work after two years but Gore supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals such as Bob Borosage, co-director of the
Washington-based Campaign for America's Future, believe ``there is
much more agreement with Gore-Lieberman than disagreement,''
particularly on Social Security and other economic issues.
Borosage's group sponsored the Monday meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants private investment accounts in Social Security; Gore
opposes them. And Bush wants government vouchers for parents whose
children attend failing schools that show no sign of improving;
Gore supports lowering class size and building more schools, but
opposes vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals are in sync with Gore on all these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Urging liberals to support the Gore-Lieberman ticket, James K.
Galbraith, an economics professor at the University of Texas in
Austin, said they are ``part of a coalition....when you're part of
a coalition, you help the coalition win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., a leading Capitol Hill liberal,
said a Gore-Lieberman victory would ``give us a leg up, no question
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a Democratic takeover of the House of
Representatives, a Gore administration would ``help us get out of
our defensive crouch and move our agenda at a faster pace,'' she
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The position of liberals in the Democratic Party is analagous to
that of social conservatives within the Republican Party. Gore and
Bush both value those outlying wings of their respective parties
and throw occasional bones to each in speeches and party platforms.
But ultimately, their strategies involve keeping the wings to the
side, not letting them cloud the image each hopes to project of
inclusive centrism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Lieberman and other centrist Democrats who dominate the
party never talk about increased government spending, a favored
progressive theme. It's always ``investment.'' They never talk
about the Democratic Party as wanting to uplift the poor and
minorities. To them, the party is ``fighting for working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reality, according to Borosage, is that union workers,
teachers and environmentalists _ people he describes as ideological
liberals _ represent 40 percent or more of the convention's
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base of the party is progressive and the activist base is
even more progressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer numbers, only 23 percent of voters consider themselves
``liberal'' or ``very liberal,'' according to a New York Times poll
released Monday. But among delegates, that rises to 34 percent, the
survey showed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American liberalism has been in eclipse since its high-water
mark in the 1960s and President Lyndon B. Johnson's ``Great
Society'' spending programs aimed at eliminating poverty and social
inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Liberalism appeared to be interred forever with the election of
Ronald Reagan in 1980. As president, Reagan spent heavily on
defense but pushed tax cuts and diminished domestic spending under
the banner of doing away with big government. The Democratic
nominee in 1984, former Vice President Walter Mondale, said he
would raise taxes as would Reagan, but Reagan would not admit it.
Reagan was re-elected that fall, winning 49 states in the greatest
Republican landslide in history.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, liberals re-invented themelves as progressives. In
the past seven years as the Clinton-Gore administration crab-walked
to the center supporting the death penalty, overhauling welfare,
and cutting a deal with Republicans to balance the budget,
progressives have re-positioned themsevles as the Democratic
party's the left-of-center conscience.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of the campaign, progressives say they are
concerned by Gore's playing defense to the Republican offensive on
the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that almost cost President Clinton
his job last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of Lieberman was widely viewed as an attempt by
Gore to insulate himself against Republican attacks on the Lewinsky
scandal and Democratic Party moral values in general. Lieberman, a
deeply religious orthodox Jew, was the first Senate Democrat to
publicly excoriate Clinton for having an affair with the former
White House intern and then lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice (of Lieberman) is about rebuking Clinton, but the
public showed us (during impeachment hearings and off-year
elections in 1998) that they're not voting on that,'' said
Borosage. ``The Gore-Lieberman ticket needs to move beyond
(defending Clinton and the Clinton-Gore administration.) Time is
getting short.``

COMPLAINTS OF WIDESPREAD IRS ABUSE ARE UNFOUNDED, DATA SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress, warned in hearings that the Internal
Revenue Service was bullying many innocent Americans, passed a law
requiring that the agency fire workers who harass taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But not one of the first 830 complaints of taxpayer harassment
filed under the new law has been upheld by the IRS or its new,
congressionally designated watchdog, according to new data.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations by the IRS and its watchdog, the Treasury
Inspector General for Tax Administration, found evidence that some
of the complaints were bogus _ made in an effort to derail audits
and tax collections. Others were either without merit or involved
misconduct that fell far short of the congressional definition of
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Sen. William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware
Republican who sponsored the 1998 IRS Reform and Restructuring Act,
said the results showed that IRS employees ``are adhering to the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Ginny Flynn, added that ``while the vast
majority of IRS employees always have adhered to the law, clearly
from our hearings some were not adhering to the law all the time
and perhaps the restructuring act and its threat of termination has
kept them from violating'' the law.
</P>
<P>
   But others argued that for all the rhetoric about abusive IRS
agents, the new law may have gone too far in subjecting IRS
employees to extreme scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who sits on the House Ways
and Means Committee, said that while he voted for the law because
he heard some evidence of IRS abuses, he thinks Congress has gone
too far in restricting the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett said he now thinks the 1998 law is ``another example of
the Republican priority of demonizing the IRS and limiting its
resources to fulfill its responsibilities, which I believe is all
aimed at trying to end income taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the key testimony in the 1997-98 hearings that preceded
the new law, alleging abuses by IRS agents, has proven to be
unfounded, based on false or misleading testimony or disproven in
subsequent court actions.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the new law has been extreme caution by IRS
workers, especially those involved in sensitive audits and
collections against those who owe taxes past due. Many IRS
employees have become much less aggressive in their collection
efforts while others say dust gathers on their requests for
permission to take enforcement actions. Collection has grown so lax
that some prominent tax advisers said in interviews last year that
they were amazed that the IRS was not attempting to collect taxes
owed by their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Congress defined harassment to include deliberate misuse of the
law, tax regulations or IRS policies to harass or retaliate against
a taxpayer. The new report, released by the Congressional Joint
Committee on Taxation last week, was first disclosed on Monday by
Tax Notes, a weekly journal.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS data showed that between July 1998, when the law was
enacted, and last May, the tax agency fired four of its 16,000
auditors for improperly threatening to audit a taxpayer. None of
these cases rose to the level of what Congress called harassment
because they involved spontaneous outbursts, not the willful misuse
of the law, regulations or policies.
</P>
<P>
   One case involved an auditor arrested for drunken driving who
told a police officer that he would ``find out'' about him and have
``a good time'' with him. The auditor asserted that his
intoxication impaired his judgment and noted that he never
mentioned an audit, but the IRS rejected the claim and fired him.
</P>
<P>
   The tax agency also dismissed 102 of its 88,000 workers for
failing to file tax returns and two for not reporting their entire
income. In addition, one worker was fired for destroying records to
cover up a mistake, an action that the IRS said did not result in
any harm to a taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   Other data sent to Congress show that IRS workers are among the
most compliant of taxpayers. A separate report from the IRS shows
that last year one in 12 taxpayers and one in 20 federal employees
and retirees either did not file tax returns or owed back taxes,
compared with one in 33 IRS workers. Many of the IRS workers who do
not file tax returns are clerks who work only during tax season,
but whose taxes are paid because they are withheld from their
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the mandatory-firing sections of the law was
disputed by Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury
Employees Union, which represents IRS workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is unnecessary and I would like to see it repealed or
at least revised,'' she said. ``The law fixes a problem that
doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said any organization will have some misconduct in its
ranks, but that four cases of misconduct among 16,000 auditors was
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, Roth's spokeswoman, said the data show that fears among
IRS workers that the new law would result in their firing just for
doing their jobs were unfounded. ``Clearly there is a very fair
process'' of investigating complaints, she said after reviewing the
data.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said the law has created an unfair burden on IRS workers
``who must endure sometimes 18 months not knowing if they will be
cleared once a complaint is made, all the time fearing they will be
fired.''

DEMOCRATS CALL CONVENTION PARTIES A LOT OF THINGS _ EXCEPT
FUND-RAISERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Exclusive) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The party that closed a city block outside Spago
in Beverly Hills on Sunday night was not a fund-raiser, Democratic
officials contended Monday. Nor was the reception for big-money
donors at the Giorgio Armani boutique, they asserted. Nor was the
late-night dessert reception for the Democratic Party's most
generous givers with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Democratic fund-raising parlance, these were merely ``donor
servicing'' or ``donor maintenance events.'' The distinction party
leaders draw is that no money actually changes hands at these
affairs; the checks have already long since been cashed. The lavish
fetes are designed to ``energize'' donors and keep the cash flowing
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have not staged a fund-raising gala in Los
Angeles, as the Republicans did in Philadelphia with a $10 million
event headlined by George W. Bush. Yet the Democratic Party has
been as aggressive as the Republicans in using its convention to
give royal treatment to the biggest donors to put them in the mood
to write new checks for the fall campaign. In fact, supporters who
contributed at least $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee
were issued a glossy, 18-page ``Convention 2000 Passport.'' It
lists four days and nights of invitation-only meals, receptions and
intimate events with party leaders, including the president, Vice
President Al Gore and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, party leaders, worried about criticism of overzealous
fund raising four years ago, are trying to play down the fund
raising occurring here.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' fund-raising impresario and
chairman of the Democratic convention, said the party's national
convention is nothing like the Republican gathering in Philadelphia
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in stark contrast to what went on in Philadelphia,
where they turned the entire Republican convention into a
fund-raiser,'' McAuliffe said. ``One night they bragged they raised
$15 million. I mean, thank goodness the Liberty Bell was bolted
down or they would have sold that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason party leaders want to keep the money
chase more muted, at least officially. In its convention platform,
the party advocates a federal ban on the large political
contributions known as ``soft money.'' Gore has pledged to make
outlawing soft money his first legislative priority. Democrats are
worried that the continuing investigation of fund-raising abuses in
the 1996 election could hurt Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In defending against charges of abusive fund raising four years
ago, Democratic leaders have done some semantic gyrations in
explaining some of their fund-raising techniques. For example, the
White House said that more than 100 coffees for top donors during
the 1996 campaign were not fund-raising events, but rather ``donor
maintenance'' affairs to reward supporters for past generosity.
Gore likewise initially described the now-infamous luncheon at the
Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in 1996 as a ``community outreach''
session, not a fund-raiser, even though nuns and others at the
temple contributed more than $100,000 to the Clinton-Gore campaign.
Later, he said his temple visit was ``finance-related.'' When he
was questioned last April by the special counsel investigating
campaign finance abuses, Gore again insisted the temple event was
not a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The party is sensitive about appearing overzealous once again.
But that has not stopped the establishment of an elite donor club
for $500,000 contributors called the Chairman's Circle. Several
unions and three individuals are among its inaugural members:
Baltimore lawyer Peter G. Angelos, Philadelphia philanthropist
Peter L. Buttenwieser and SlimFast Foods founder S. Daniel Abraham.
(The Republicans' own top-donor club, the Regents, has 139
individuals and corporations that have given $250,000 or more.)
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party identifies four dozen sponsors of their
``donor servicing'' affairs in Los Angeles, including America
Online, BellSouth, Ernst &AMP; Young, Fannie Mae, Texaco and United
Parcel Service. The list also includes more obscure sponsors such
as Homestore.com, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive
Surgery, the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians and the
Soboda Band of Mission Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts by McAuliffe and other Democratic officials
to distinguish their convention from the Republicans' gathering in
Philadelphia, some party officials acknowledge that thanking donors
and soliciting more funds are an important part of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pretending we're not trying to raise money here,''
said Joe Andrew, the Democratic national party chairman. ``We're
obviously trying to raise money to get the message of Gore and
Lieberman to the country. It costs money to get that message on
television.'' But Andrew also said many of the receptions this week
fall in the ``donor servicing'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., who, with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., has championed campaign finance overhaul legislation, said
in an interview Monday that he is disgusted and ashamed of his
party's fund-raising activities here. He called them ``a system of
legalized bribery and legalized extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that some party officials said that little or no fund
raising was occurring outside the Staples Center, Feingold scoffed.
``That's absurd,'' he said. ``In room after room, hotel after hotel
and private home after private home, there are literally scores of
fund-raisers that include contribution levels as high as $50,000 or
$100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold is the co-sponsor, with McCain, of legislation that
would ban soft money. Before a cheering throng at the shadow
convention here on Sunday, Feingold declared that the major
political parties' conventions have become nothing more than a
brazen chase for large donations and ``corporate trade shows for
the delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These conventions are serving as a symbol of the corruption
and influence of money in our system that surely will not be lost
on the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold cited as examples the numerous ``tributes'' to members
of Congress sponsored by major corporations and attended by donors
of $20,000 to $100,000. Among them are a luncheon for Sen. Dianne
Feinstein of California sponsored by Chevron and a dinner for Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota paid for by Global Crossing, a
telecommunications concern. BellSouth, US West, EchoStar
Communications and UPS are picking up the tab for a late night
concert by singer Cheryl Crow on behalf of Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention is holding only one formal
fund-raiser, a concert featuring Barbra Streisand, Babyface and
Whoopi Goldberg on Thursday night following the close of the
convention. Party officials estimated the concert will raise
between $3 million and $4 million in ``hard money,'' contributions
that are limited in size (the maximum individual donation is
$1,000) but can be used for any political purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions are used to rally the political troops but also to
get our donors excited and motivated for the fall,'' said Jenny
Backus, the DNC spokeswoman. ``We all have the same goal _ to elect
a Democratic president and Congress.''

   The convention itself is being underwritten by a roster of
blue-chip corporations, many of whom also sponsored the Republican
convention. General Motors, for example, is contributing $1 million
in cash and services and 400 cars, the same level of largess it
displayed in Philadelphia. The nation's largest automaker is also
sponsoring several receptions for lawmakers and donors.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, the political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said the convention was a time to reward past
donors and build a fund-raising base for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the convention package we offer donors is an
incentive for generosity,'' Jordan said. ``But this isn't the week
for picking up checks. This is the week for picking up business
cards.''

COMMENTARY: SHAH KHAMENEI 
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  Watching Iranian politics today is a lot like watching the
Weather Channel during hurricane season. The weatherman comes on
and points to a group of clouds somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. He
tells you it's not a hurricane just yet, but if you study the cloud
patterns you can see the storm forming. If the current winds and
temperatures persist, he concludes, it will definitely be upgraded
from tropical storm to hurricane.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so it is with Iran. Right now, the struggle between the
reformers and conservatives there is still just the political
equivalent of a tropical storm, with the occasional bursts of
student rioting and mysterious murders. But if you look at the
trends closely, and if temperatures in Iran keep rising, this
low-grade struggle could turn into an Iranian version of the
perfect storm.
</P>
<P>
   What's driving this storm is the behavior of Iran's top leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is increasingly behaving as if he were
``Shah Khamenei.'' He and his conservative allies have been
mounting a creeping coup against the democratic process in Iran. If
it continues, Iran could feature the first big civil clash of the
globalization era _ that is, a popular struggle between localizers,
who want to keep Iran isolated from global trends and dominated by
religious theology, versus the globalizers, who increasingly know
how the rest of the world lives and want to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: In May 1997 the cleric Mohammad Khatami, running as
a moderate, was elected president by a stunning landslide. He
trounced the conservative candidate, who was supported by Khamenei.
Khamenei carries the title supreme leader, he sits above the
president and he controls Iran's religious institutions, courts,
Revolutionary Guards and Islamic business conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after becoming president, Khatami unleashed a flowering of
liberal Iranian newspapers and magazines, run by journalists,
cartoonists and writers pushing for a more open, democratic Iran,
with more rule of law and a healthier civil society. But he was
hamstrung in pushing through more liberal laws by the fact that the
Iranian Parliament was still dominated by conservatives. He
preached patience, telling his followers to abide by the process
and wait until the parliamentary elections this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the parliamentary elections happened and the reformers,
once again, trounced the conservatives, winning nearly 200 of the
290 seats _ a real popular rebuke to clerical rule.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for the conservatives, who, led by Khamenei,
then launched their creeping coup against democracy. Using a crude
press-control law rammed through the last Parliament at the
eleventh hour, and a judiciary still entirely under their thumb,
the conservatives shut down some 20 reformist newspapers and
magazines and threw a host of leading journalists in jail on
charges of insulting Islam. Ebrahim Nabavi was jailed Saturday,
just as he was being honored by his peers as Iran's best satirist,
while Muhammad Quchani was jailed Sunday after being honored as the
country's best political writer.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei's Council of Guardians also ruled that Parliament had
no authority to investigate any institution that he oversees _
i.e., the army, the Revolutionary Guards, the conglomerates and the
courts. And in an unprecedented claim of authority, Khamenei
ordered the new Parliament not to overturn the draconian press law.
This is the Soviet Union, Islamic style.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot say enough about the courage of Iran's liberal
journalists in resisting this creeping coup, and even exposing how
government agents sent by the conservatives murdered several
dissidents in the winter of 1998. These journalists are real heroes
of democracy in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's gut-check time for Khatami: He was elected by
Iran's reformist majority to open their society. He told them to be
patient and follow the process. They did and now they're in jail.
President Khatami is coming to the U.N. in September to push his
plan for making the year 2000 a year of ``dialogue among
civilizations.'' Well, dialogue begins at home. It's Iran's
civilization that's imperiled, and if President Khatami can't
protect that, something tells me the brave men and women of Iran,
who fought the anti-democratic shah, will fight the anti-democratic
ayatollahs. Beware: hurricane forming in Iran.

SEEING A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE'S PLACE IN A SMILEY-FACED WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Held has had just about enough of accentuating the
positive and eliminating the negative.
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to cheer up, look on the bright side or let a
smile be her umbrella. And she is not planning to put a smiley face
sticker on her car bumper any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Held views such activities as rather worrisome. She is
one of a small band of psychologists who believe their profession _
and indeed America as a whole _ has succumbed to an ethos of
unrelenting positivity. This ``tyranny of the positive attitude,''
as Held sees it, prescribes cheerfulness and optimism as a formula
for success, resilience and good health, and equates negativity
with failure, vulnerability and general unhealthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Positive thinking is a staple of self-help books, popular music
and Sunday sermons. And in recent years, it has also found a home
in the positive psychology movement, which was founded to correct
what its leaders, including Dr. Martin Seligman, a professor of
psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and a former president
of the American Psychological Association, saw as the field's
overly narrow focus on mental illness and human failing.
</P>
<P>
   But Held and like-minded colleagues, who gathered last week at
the psychological association's annual meetings in Washington for a
symposium titled ``The (Overlooked) Virtues of Negativity,'' feel
that bliss can be taken too far.
</P>
<P>
   While positive thinking has its advantages, they argue, a little
whining now and then is not such a bad thing. Pessimism, in some
circumstances, may have its place. And the unrelieved pressure to
be upbeat, they assert, may gloss over individual needs and
differences, and may make some people feel worse instead of better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that we're not making space for people to feel
bad,'' said Held, a clinical psychologist at Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine, and the author of ``Stop Smiling Start
Kvetching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very hard,'' Held said. ``If you're having a hard time
with something, it can make it harder to cope if you feel pressure
to act OK when you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   A large body of experimental work has elaborated on the pluses
of optimism and positive thinking, which appear to have beneficial
effects on performance, social adjustment and some aspects of
health. But at least some research supports the notion that in some
cases, it may be more useful to see the glass as half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julie Norem, a social psychologist at Wellesley College, for
example, has studied ``defensive pessimism,'' a coping strategy
that involves setting unrealistically low expectations, then
mentally playing out all the possible outcomes of a given
situation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Norem explained, a defensive pessimist is likely
to approach a coming public speaking engagement with mounting
anxiety. But rather than giving herself a pep talk or using
positive imagery to calm herself down, the defensive pessimist will
picture herself tripping over the microphone cord, dropping her
notes and dissolving into a fit of coughing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this anxious reverie will also include plans for avoiding
such humiliation, like wearing low heeled-shoes or having a glass
of water on the lectern. ``This mental rehearsal tends to make
defensive pessimists feel less anxious, and so they actually
perform better,'' Norem said.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory experiments, the psychologist and her colleagues
have found, defensive pessimists indeed perform as well on tasks as
``strategic optimists,'' who are less anxious, tend to set high
expectations for their own performance and avoid thinking about all
the things that could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of each group suffers when it is impeded
from engaging in its preferred strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, for example, defensive pessimists and strategic
optimists participated in a dart throwing exercise. The subjects
were randomly assigned to prepare for the task in one of three
ways. In one, they engaged in ``coping imagery,'' imagining
something going wrong and taking steps to fix it, a strategy close
to the natural approach of defensive pessimists. In the second, the
subjects practiced ``mastery,'' imagining a flawless performance.
In the third, the participants engaged in a relaxation exercise,
distracting themselves from the pending dart-throwing by imagining
a peaceful scene, perhaps a beach.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive pessimists, the researchers found, did well in the
game when they prepared using imagery that mimicked their preferred
coping style. But their performance declined when they imagined
performing perfectly and they did even worse when asked to act like
optimists, distracting themselves with relaxing images. Strategic
optimists, in contrast, performed best after the relaxation
exercise and worst when they imagined things going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have investigated the benefits of griping
(high for those who do it infrequently, lower for frequent
complainers) and extent of pessimism in different cultures.
(Asian-Americans, one study found, are more pessimistic than
Caucasian-Americans, and are more likely to use pessimism as a way
of coping.)
</P>
<P>
   Work by Dr. James Pennebaker, a professor of psychology at the
University of Texas at Austin, also underlines the positive role of
what some might call ``constructive negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Obsessively ruminating about how miserable life is, studies
show, can have a harmful effect on health. But in a series of
studies, Pennebaker and his colleagues asked subjects to focus on
stressful or disturbing life events in a structured way, writing
essays about the most traumatic experience of their lives, for
example. The subjects' health improved on a variety of measures,
and this improvement persisted for up to four months after the
studies were over.
</P>
<P>
   Pennebaker said he was happy to be considered part of the
positive psychology movement but that ``a lot depends on what we
mean by positive psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some reasonably compelling evidence to suggest that
when people are falsely peppy and upbeat and chipper, it's not very
healthy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, little data supports the idea that a positive
attitude enhances health _ something he pointed out repeatedly
several years ago when his wife developed breast cancer, and people
kept telling her, ``You just need to be positive all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pennebaker added, a 1989 study he published with Dr.
David Watson, now at the University of Iowa, indicates that even
nervous, unhappy people, prone to chronic complaining, appear to be
no more unhealthy than their buoyant peers. Subjects in the study
who scored high on measures of nervousness, apprehension,
irritability and oversensitivity were more likely to complain about
physical symptoms. But they were no more likely to visit the
doctor, develop high blood pressure or die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad to be nervous and it's not bad to be angry,''
Watson said in an interview. ``We have these emotions because they
serve useful functions for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants in last week's symposium emphasized that they
hoped to temper, not to disparage the field's interest in positive
things. ``I'm not saying it's good to let people wallow in the
negative,'' said Dr. Arthur Beauhart, a humanistic psychologist at
California State University at Dominguez Hills. ``I see this as a
healthy corrective, or an expanding of the positive psychology
movement.'' But psychologists identified with that movement say
that positive psychology already makes clear that at times optimism
is neither appropriate nor beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman, a founder of positive psychology, expressed amusement
that a positive focus could stir controversy. ``I'm all for
negative psychology,'' he said. ``I spent 35 years of my life doing
it. It just seems to me that there's no danger that people are
going to be working exclusively on the positive. I think most of
psychology has been about going from minus 8 to minus 5.''

FRIEDA MAE HARDIN, NAVY YEOMAN FROM 1918, DIES AT 103 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frieda Mae Hardin, who joined the Navy during World War I, when
women were still denied the right to vote, and 79 years later came
to represent the achievements of all the women in the armed forces,
died Wednesday in Livermore, Calif. She was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a World War I ``yeomanette'' uniform and a wide-brimmed
hat reading ``U.S. Naval Reserve,'' Hardin provided the emotional
high point at October 1997 ceremonies at Arlington National
Cemetery dedicating the Women in Military Service for America
Memorial honoring the almost two million women who had served in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Making her way to the speaker's stand before an audience
estimated at 30,000, Hardin was accompanied by her son Jerald
Kirsten, a retired Navy captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loud voice, mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin's audience heard her loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 101 years of living, I have observed many wonderful
achievements but none as important or as meaningful as the progress
of women taking their rightful place in society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those women now in military service, I say, `Carry on.' To
those young women who may be thinking about a career in the
military service, I say, `Go for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-minute talk brought three standing ovations and left many
in the crowd in tears.
</P>
<P>
   When Frieda Mae Green was born on Sept. 22, 1896, in Eden
Valley, Minn., a formal role for women in the armed forces could
hardly be foreseen. Women had served as nurses in a quasi-military
capacity but there were no women in the regular Navy or Army.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1917, with America's entry into World War I imminent,
Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels called on women to enlist in the
Naval Reserve to free sailors for combat duty.
</P>
<P>
   Frieda's father, a railroad worker, had moved the family to
Kentucky and then Ohio, and she had taken a job at a department
store in the town of Portsmouth. One day in 1918, she saw a
newspaper notice that a Navy recruiter was arriving. ``I heard
about the Navy taking women on a Saturday night, and I signed up
first thing Monday morning,'' she would recall.
</P>
<P>
   According to her son Jerald, when she phoned her mother to tell
her what she had done, ``Her mother said, `Frieda, you get home
this instant.'''
</P>
<P>
   Frieda's mother took her back to the recruiting station and told
the Navy man that she could not sign up without her father's
permission. But the next day, her father said, ``Let her go,'' and
off she went.
</P>
<P>
   She was among almost 12,000 women who served in the Navy during
World War I as clerks, draftsmen, translators, camouflage designers
and recruiters. They were formally designated Yeomen (F), for
female, but were known as Yeomanettes. She was on active duty from
September 1918 to March 1919 at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia,
performing clerical duties and receiving an outstanding grade in
reading proficiency and perfect marks in obedience and sobriety,
the three areas in which the Navy graded women. She would remain a
teetotaler and even refused a glass of celebratory champagne while
flying to the 1997 memorial ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   By 1920, all the Yeomanettes were released from duty, and women
would not be permitted to serve in the Navy again until the Waves
were established in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Navy, Frieda Green married William Kirsten, a
chef, and they settled in the Lodi-Stockton area of California. She
is survived by four children from that marriage, Capt. Kirsten, of
Lodi; Roy Kirsten, of Stockton; Warren Kirsten, of Sacramento, all
military veterans, and a daughter, Mary Botto, of Stockton; 12
grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and 29
great-great-grandchildren. William Kirsten and three other husbands
died earlier; the last was Robert Hardin. In speaking at the
memorial dedication, Hardin said that ``a world of opportunity''
awaited women in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my part, I have always been very proud of my Navy
service,'' she told the audience. ``It is not likely that I will be
meeting with you again, so I bid each of you a fond farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the crowd was a woman named Ann Darr, who had
served during World War II in the Women's Air Force Service Pilots,
or Wasps.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on that moment at the memorial, she would write:
``When Frieda Mae Hardin spoke, reminding us she couldn't vote when
she signed up, saying to the young people, `Go for it!' we were
almost ready to serve again.''

CLINTON TELLS DEMOCRATS THAT GORE WILL KEEP PROSPERITY ROLLING &HT;    (EDS: Will be updated with full speech)
 &HT;    lBy STEWART M. POWELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES President Clinton, declaring that the Democratic
ticket of Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman ``will keep our prosperity
going,'' boasted to the Democratic National Convention Monday night
that his eight-year partnership with Gore has fashioned ``a better
country`` from the wreckage of past Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a charismatic Arkansas Democrat who has sparked
controversy almost from the day he took office, bid farewell to the
Democratic faithful, offered warm praise for his loyal vice
president and appealed to voters to choose Gore's specifics-rich
policy proposals over what the president portrayed as the vague,
ill-considered schemes of Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment of unprecedented good fortune, our people face
a fundamental choice: Are we going to keep this progress and
prosperity going?`` Clinton rhetorically asked cheering party
faithful crammed into the 20,590-seat Staples Center for the
opening night of the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed it
together. And we're not going back,`` Clinton declared. First lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who introduced her husband for his
valedictory to the faithful,
</P>
<P>
   echoed her husband's theme in remarks designed to bolster her
campaign for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a stronger, better country than we were in 1992,'' Mrs.
Clinton said, adding that America's progress can continue with Gore
and Lieberman. ``They have what it takes; they'll do what it
takes,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a combative partisan, sought to counter claims
voiced by Bush at the Republican convention on Aug. 3 that the
Clinton-Gore administration had squandered`` opportunities
presented by unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear America's
success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,``
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president proudly laid claim to responsibility for the
longest economic boom in American history and for generating
federal budget surpluses, slashing the national debt, restoring
national confidence and transforming education, child care, the
welfare system, inner cities and the federal tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has progressed not just economically but as a
community,`` Clinton said. ``We're not just better off we're also a
better country
</P>
<P>
   more decent, more humane, more united moving forward and working
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who seized the limelight with appearances at more than
20 events over four days in Los Angeles, was scheduled to leave Los
Angeles on Tuesday for a campaign rally in Monroe, Mich., where he
will symbolically pass the torch to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the convention that Gore had been worked side by
side in the Oval Office ``in the most difficult days of the last
years, when we faced the toughest issues.'' Clinton added: ``He was
always there.'' Gore ``understands the future and how sweeping
changes can affect Americans' daily lives,'' Clinton said, adding
that a Gore-Lieberman administration ``will keep our prosperity
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart derided Bush's
claims that Americans had suffered under the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush family may be worse off than they were eight years
ago, but I think the vast majority of Americans will argue that
their lives have become better,`` Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned to use his farewell address to give a boost
to the Senate campaign of his wife of 25 years, who faces a tough
fight with Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. , Lockhart said. Clinton, who has said he
plans to join his wife at their newly-purchased home in Chappaqua,
N.Y., after leaving the White House, wanted to outline ways that
she could help New York's 18 million people, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman linked up on the campaign trail in St. Louis
to watch the Clintons' nationally televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staged a symbolic pilgrimage earlier in the day to the home
town of President Harry S. Truman, the scrappy, plain-spoken
Missouri Democrat who came from behind in 1948 to extend Democrats'
hold on the White House to 20 straight years until 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a contrast in this election and the American people
deserve to know the details of what's being proposed by the two
major parties,`` Gore told a forum in Independence, Mo. ``The
American people need to know the specifics of how the American
people would be affected if the other side won.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Stanley Greenberg, who served as the Clinton-Gore
campaign's pollster in 1992, told reporters that Gore needs to
ignite voter turnout by focusing public attention on differences
between the rivals. ``What matters for turnout is having an
election that matters,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide survey, conducted by John Zogby of Zogby
International in Utica, N.Y., and released Monday, showed Bush's
17-percentage-point edge over Gore following the GOP convention had
been cut to 3 percentage points 43 percent for Bush to 40 percent
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said in an NBC News' interview
that Clinton's successes are helping to overshadow a dark chapter
in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the escapades of President Clinton in the White
House are still in people's memories, but I think that time is
passing by,`` Carter said, adding: ``There has never been a hint of
scandal about Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who returns to the campaign trail on Friday with a
symbolic raid on Gore's native Tennessee, remained at his
1,500-acre ranch in Crawford, Texas.

PRESIDENT OF SRI LANKA MOVES TOWARD PEACE, BUT OTHERS DO NOT
FOLLOW
</HEADLINE>
 By CELIA W. DUGGER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ This war-haunted nation's president,
blinded in her right eye by a suicide bomber's attack, still talks
of peace. But many ordinary Sri Lankans are more convinced than
ever that no end is near to the country's 17-year war with the
Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga hoped that a new constitution
she proposed on Aug. 3 would preserve Sri Lanka as a unified nation
while satisfying the demands of the Tamil minority for greater
authority to rule themselves in the north and east, which the
Tamils regard as their traditional homelands.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has collapsed for now, though Kumaratunga has vowed
to revive it after national elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a feeling of menace hovers over the capital, even
though there has been a lull in the fierce battles between the
rebel group, known as the Tamil Tigers, and the government in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rife that the Tigers are gearing up for a surprise
attack in the north or east _ and more terrorist bombings in
Colombo. Armed sentries dot the cityscape, on the lookout for
suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Parliament from Kumaratunga's party were whisked to
Parliament in helicopters to avoid feared attacks while the
proposed constitution was debated. Streets around it were closed to
cars. The only approach was on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Buddhist monks in saffron robes who cast themselves
as guardians of the nation, hiked to the gates of Parliament to
denounce the proposal as a first step toward a division of the
country between the majority Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists,
and the Tamils, who are mostly Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga, head of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, spent months
negotiating with the opposition United National Party and had come
closer than ever before to reaching a consensus with its leaders _
which would have meant a united front of all the major Sinhalese
politicians in favor of greater autonomy for the Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   But just before the constitution was introduced, the UNP
announced that it would oppose the proposal, largely because it
included transitional provisions to allow Kumaratunga, who was
re-elected president in December, to continue in power until 2005,
despite the new constitution's abolition of the executive
presidency in favor a parliamentary system headed by a prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for this lady,'' said V. Anandasangaree, senior
vice president of the Tamil United Liberation Front, a moderate
political party. ``She had moved heaven and earth to find a
solution to the problem, but the UNP took her for a ride and then
dropped her like a hot potato.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just among the Sinhalese opposition that
Kumaratunga has run into political trouble. Her proposal, written
with the hope of winning over the Tamils, has stirred more
ambivalence than enthusiasm among Tamil politicians who have risked
their lives and the wrath of the Tigers by favoring a political
settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front decided they could
not support the constitution because they felt that Kumaratunga had
diluted the autonomy provisions too much in her negotiations with
the UNP.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision was particularly poignant because a member of
Parliament from their party, the constitutional scholar Neelan
Tiruchelvam, was the chief Tamil architect of earlier drafts _ and
was assassinated by a suicide bomber a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kumaratunga considers her proposal the country's best
chance for peace. She says it would eventually convince Tamils that
the Sinhalese were willing to share power with them, sapping
support for the Tigers, whose group's full name is the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weapons that the LTTE fear the most are not the weapons of
war,'' she said in an interview on Friday at Temple Trees, the
presidential residence. ``The weapon they fear most is peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Sri Lankans have ceased to believe that the Tigers will
ever compromise on their demand for the independent homeland they
call Eelam, an intransigence that condemns the country to endless
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is to fight until the Tigers surrender,'' said
Pradeep Edirisooya, 31, a Sinhalese travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the president's new constitution for giving
Tamils a better deal, Thirumahal, a Tamil law student who has only
one name, said she, too, felt it would not end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tamils aren't fighting the Sinhalese,'' she said. ``The
government is fighting the LTTE. You cannot stop the war. It used
to be about ethnicity. Now it's a power struggle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Sinhalese hardliners who oppose Kumaratunga's plan
organized raucous protests, there were few if any spontaneous and
emotional demonstrations in favor of it. The constituency for peace
was very quiet.
</P>
<P>
   And her government's frantic efforts to put together a
two-thirds majority in Parliament failed. Less than a week after
she introduced the plan, she withdrew it rather than face certain
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Kumaratunga has not given up. She has a
new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year term of this Parliament ends on Aug. 24, and
national elections must be held by early November. If she is unable
to resurrect the constitutional package in the coming week, she
said her party's candidates would ask the public for a mandate to
pass it with a simple parliamentary majority, rather than the
required two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may go slightly against a clause of the present
constitution,'' she said, ``but it is democratic and legal.''.
</P>
<P>
   If the constitution is adopted in the way she describes, it will
inevitably face legal challenges _ and would still have to be
adopted in a national referendum. Even if it surmounted those
hurdles, many here question whether it would bring the country
closer to peace.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tigers, as well as the hardliners among the Sinhalese,
are likely to do all they can to make sure she does not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proposed constitution gives the central government
sweeping powers to crush any secessionist movement and enshrines
Buddhism in ``the foremost place,'' the monks who protested at the
gates of Parliament last week denounced it is a betrayal of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   A raucous cheer of victory rose from a throng of holy men when a
priest announced that the government had withdrawn its peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to give a certain part of this country to Tiger
terrorists and stay in power all her life,'' said M. Ananda, a monk
who shielded his shaved head from the blazing sun under a
multicolored umbrella. ``That's her ulterior motive. She has not
revealed the secret to the people of this country.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The terrifying report hopped from skybox to skybox
like the West Nile virus: Al Gore was writing his own acceptance
speech. Eek! cried the talking heads and the pundits. The speech
will be dull, boring. It will be _ gasp _ specific.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably the first time anyone has been scared by the
absence of a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a method to Al Gore's supposed madness _ a
recognition that politics and the broader culture are in the midst
of a significant transition.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican Convention two weeks ago captured barely 7
percent of the viewing audience, CBS' ``Survivor'' scored ratings
higher than all the convention coverage on all the broadcast and
cable networks combined. Why? ``Survivor'' has real people, real
suspense and no scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Yahoo. That same week, it attracted 25 million visitors
(not counting the same people coming back more than once), nearly
10 million more people than watched the elephant hats in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   By writing his own speech, speaking in his own authentic voice,
and offering specifics for people to evaluate on their terms, Gore
may be much more in sync with the voters than his opponent or the
press corps dare to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention reminded me of my worst days as a
political speechwriter. I'd labor over a carefully argued,
beautifully reasoned, elegantly written text. Then some grizzled
senior aide would toss the draft back to me and say: ``Uh, it's
fine, but you need to add a little more rhetoric'' _ as if back in
my office, I had a spice rack with little bottles of phrases, a few
sprinkles of which could disguise the taste of what I'd written.
</P>
<P>
   The punditocracy hailed George W. Bush's acceptance speech, but
when The Washington Post convened a panel of swing voters, the
reaction was overwhelming: Lovely speech, but where were the
specifics?
</P>
<P>
   When Newsweek asked voters how important it is that Gore offer
specifics in his convention speech, a stunning 75 percent said
``very important.'' Contrast that with 24 percent who said it was
very important for him to talk about his own life experiences and
the 18 percent who thought it crucial that he discuss his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that an Al Gore policy-laden speech might be hard
going,'' said Fox News' Brit Hume when he heard that the vice
pesident was hunched over his laptop. But that's probably because
he's not one of the 41 million Americans who can't afford health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   If I were still advising the vice president, I'd recommend the
new media full monty. Write the speech in your own voice _ make it
conversation, not oratory. Deliver it your own way, and follow it
with a live, nationally televised call-in question and answer
program. Put all your policy proposals on the campaign Web site,
and let voters plug in their own preferences to see if they agree.
The era of Big Speechwriter is over.

<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Ill. _ Not all evangelical Protestants take their
political signals from the organized religious right, but the
majority do vote Republican. The entry of Sen. Joseph Lieberman
into Campaign 2000 won't change that, but it has brought to light
some surprising interplays between orthodox Jews and evangelicals.
And it has made Jews, who altogether make up only 2 percent of the
population, and evangelicals, who approach 25 percent, the two most
visible groups on the scene of religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   It still surprises some people when evangelicals and observant
Jews occasionally team up or smile at each other. Old stereotypes
lump conservative Protestants into a single camp in which Jews are
seen as Christ-deniers. So when evangelicals speak well of
Lieberman as an observer of the sabbath and exponent of family
values, one wonders: How deep can the cultural bonds of sympathy
and common purpose go?
</P>
<P>
   Often these developing sympathies belong to the same ``the enemy
of my enemy is my friend'' school that causes many evangelicals who
once called the pope the antichrist to celebrate John Paul II as an
ally in the anti-abortion cause. There is also the ``at least they
believe in something'' syndrome. The orthodox and the evangelicals
are both at war against wishy-washy relativism. Evangelicals, who
used to make much of Sunday a day of rest, are awed when Lieberman
reminds the country that real believers are willing to
inconvenience themselves by keeping the sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   And there are deeper bonds. The evangelical movement includes on
its right premillennialists who believe that biblical prophesies
say there must be a nation of Israel, whose boundaries match those
from the time of Christ, before Jesus will return to earth. Knowing
about premillennialism helps the public understand why
fundamentalists like Jerry Falwell have received awards from
Israel, and why they are so anti-Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Also clustered under the single name evangelicals (think
followers of Billy Graham when you hear that word) are
pentecostals, ``Holy Spirit-moved'' believers who also see
themselves as friends of Jews, and especially the orthodox. Pat
Robertson is a pentecostalist. Finally, there are Southern
Baptists, the biggest Protestant group. They alienate Jews when
their leaders aver that God does not hear Jews' prayers or when
they target Jews for conversion. But among them, too, are many who
admire the values of modern orthodox Judaism as embodied in
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Like evangelicals, orthodox Jews are not all hard-line. The
modern orthodoxy with which Lieberman identifies himself is on the
moderate side; moreover, he reads it as permitting abortion in
certain circumstances. His commitment to help keep abortion legal
angers those conservative Protestants who think orthodoxy must mean
anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most evangelicals see Lieberman's selection as enlarging the
space for themselves in American culture. He is celebrated for
being different from mainstream culture while they have been
criticized for it. They mention God in public and draw sneers; he
does, and is admired. Will the acceptance of his views lead to
greater acceptance of theirs?
</P>
<P>
   For one reason, a double standard may remain. Nonevangelical
Americans do not fear that orthodox Jews will try to convert them,
or impose their beliefs on the nation. But many people do see a
threat in the efforts by evangelical Christians like Pat Robertson
to change laws to conform to their beliefs and in effect produce a
uniformly Christian America.
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman candidacy has done evangelicals and others a favor
by forcing new debates over religion in politics. There are dangers
ahead, dangers of the use and misuse of religion. The founders of
the nation, all of them religious, gave plenty of signals that when
it comes to faith and politics, the watchwords are handle with
care. But handle this combination Americans must and will, and with
new forces, Lieberman and modern orthodoxy, added to the mix.

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: GOP IN THE ENEMY'S LAIR
 &HT;    Repeating to cleat garble.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seen threading his way through a bevy of Democrats
at their annual convention: Republican National Chairman Jim
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson has taken on the role of ``rapid-response attack dog''
in responding to the Democrats' sallies. But he also made some
now-it-can-be-told news of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a reporter's query, he confirmed that the
Republicans chose Philadelphia as the site of their 2000 convention
to pre-empt the Democrats from holding their convention there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if we hadn't have moved, Al Gore would have gone to
Philadelphia,'' Nicholson said. ``Pennsylvania is in play in
November. Fortunately, we got to pick first.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Democrats could have trailed the GOP parade into
the City of Brotherly Love. Both major parties held their
conventions there in 1948. But the city's host committee, led by
former Philadelphia mayor (and current Democratic general chairman)
Ed Rendell, had only enough money in the till to support one such
mega-event.
</P>
<P>
   From delegates to media, most people here complain about how
little access they have to the convention floor, the hot parties
and the celebrities who attend them.
</P>
<P>
   Not Aaron Harber. If anything, he's got too much access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get double invitations to everything,'' Huber sighed Sunday
night, knee-deep in celebrities at a party sponsored by People for
the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harber is a triple threat here. The host of a Boulder,
Colo., TV show, ``Spontaneous Combustion,'' Harber may be the only
person at this convention _ or any other, in fact _ who is a
credentialed member of the media, a delegate (from Colorado for
Gore) and a member of the electoral college.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a delegate twice before, for Gary Hart in 1984 and
Bill Clinton in 1996. He has figured out how to use his power here
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have unlimited floor privileges and I'm going to abuse
them,'' Harber said with a grin. ``I'll use them about half the
time and then share them with alternates, friends and anyone
willing to pay $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a pleasant outdoor lunch at a Santa Monica watering hole,
Arianna Huffington, chief organizer of the so-called Shadow
Conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, wondered why Sen. Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., co-author of the McCain-Feingold campaign reform
bill, wasn't speaking at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she noted, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had also
spoken to her group, got a prime-time slot in Philadelphia. And had
not Al Gore recently pledged to make the McCain-Feingold bill ``the
very first piece of legislation I will submit to Congress'' as
president?
</P>
<P>
   Her lunch companion suggested Feingold hadn't exactly helped his
standing with party regulars by coming before Huffington's group
Sunday and blasting the upcoming convention, which is being
</P>
<P>
   held just down the street, as (along with the Republicans) as
``the worst display of money and corruption in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been saying that while George Bush may outshine
Al Gore on the personality meter, when it comes to the issues
voters care about most, Gore will come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is not an instinctive politician,'' Stan Greenberg, the
prospective nominee's official pollster for strategic planning,
told reporters Monday. ``I have no doubt he'll be heard on the
issues, but it won't be as easy as it is for a more glib
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's most recent national poll, taken Aug. 8-10, found
Gore running nine points behind Bush _ about mid-range in the
current basket of presidential match-ups. Perhaps more significant
</P>
<P>
   was the poll's list of issues that prospective voters think the
government should deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Eight: education (20 percent), moral decline (17),
health care (16), retirement and Social Security (14), taxes and
crime (8 points apiece), the economy and the environment (5 each).
</P>
<P>
   But then came some worrisome news for the Democrats: by a margin
of 39 to 38 percent, slightly more voters trusted the Republicans
more to do something about these key issues than the
</P>
<P>
   Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia Democrats gathered in Los Angeles, the newest
addition to their delegate list _ Sen. Zell Miller _ was back in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller became an automatic delegate to the 2000 gathering after
being appointed earlier this month to succeed the late Sen. Paul
Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who delivered a keynote speech in 1992 that gained
national attention, and listened to a convention radio broadcast
during the birth of one of his sons, chose to spend this convention
week in Georgia, touring military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Miller spokesman Rick Dent said the two-term governor who left
office in 1998 never planned to go to this year's convention even
before the Senate appointment.
</P>
<P>
   But political scientists say the strategy of running his own
campaign in Georgia rather than mingling with party leaders and
raising money in the land of Hollywood legends is also a strategic
move that makes it harder for Republicans to tie him to President
Clinton and other national Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was in Washington last week, taking care of his Senate
transition, when the Democratic ticket made a highly-publicized
stop in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``His priorities right now are the bases this week and spending
as much time as possible on policy and getting up to speed,'' Dent
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party officials won't be able to seat an alternate to
substitute for the absent Miller, who toured Fort Stewart in
Hinesville on Monday and was scheduled for trips to Augusta's Fort
Gordon and Warner Robins Air Force Base on Tuesday and Thursday.

LITTLE PROGRESS AS VERIZON STRIKE DRAGS INTO SECOND WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the ninth day of the 12-state strike against
Verizon Communications, negotiators made little progress Monday as
unions and company executives debated the effect on workers of the
Bell Atlantic merger with GTE, which created Verizon and made it
the nation's largest telecommunications employer.
</P>
<P>
   And with no easy solutions in sight, both sides were gauging how
long a strike each was willing and able to endure. Verizon has
begun to consider bringing in managers from other parts of the
country to provide relief for the 30,000 managers within the region
who are trying to fill in for the 86,000 employees on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Some strikers on picket lines, meanwhile, were voicing worry
about more days without a paycheck than many had expected when they
walked off their jobs on Aug. 6. The Communications Workers of
America and International Brotherhood of America have set their
sights on other issues, after having secured a concession late last
week allowing them to organize more easily in Verizon's wireless
division.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle now to settling the strike involves
Verizon's ability to shift work from one region to another in an
effort to increase the efficiency of operations or reduce labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bell Atlantic, the local telephone company merged with
GTE, a telecommunications company that operates telephone companies
in more than a dozen other states around the country. Verizon also
includes a venture with Vodafone Airtouch of Britain that has
become the largest wireless carrier in the United States.
Altogether, Verizon has 260,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that their jobs might be threatened by movement of
some work to other states, striking employees are seeking greater
job stability. The strikers are in 12 states from Maine to
Virginia, and the District of Columbia _ where union membership is
generally more widespread and wages higher than in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Given the consolidation in the telecommunications industry in
recent years, it is little surprise that Verizon and its unions
would lock horns over cost-cutting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we consider essential to the functioning of
our company on a competitive level,'' said Eric Rabe, Verizon's
spokesman. ``This is about the workings of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as they worry about losing some work, the unions are
also protesting they sometimes have too much of it. They are
seeking to limit mandatory overtime, which can tack on 15 hours to
20 hours of extra work each week for some employees. Source of
stress in the workplace, such practices as the monitoring of
operators' calls with customers, is also an important issue for the
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it comes down to,'' said Jeff Miller, a spokesman
for the Communications Workers union. ``We're waiting to see action
on these major issues which management seems to consider normal, or
even minor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, strikers and the company have settled down for
a walkout longer than either side seemed to have expected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having managers fill in for striking employees,
Verizon said it had brought in nearly 300 retired employees to work
as technicians and customer service representatives. If the strike
goes on much longer, the company said it was also considering
bringing in managers from regions that had been served by GTE to
perform some work. Most of the managers filling in for the strikers
have not had a day off since the strike began, and have been
required to work 12-hour shifts. Verizon executives have said the
managers would have to work 13 days consecutively before getting a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is also considering hiring people from outside the
company, although it is not clear when and how this would occur,
said Rabe, Verizon's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, union officials have said they are prepared to dip
into their $400 million strike fund to provide strikers with $200 a
week if the strike enters a fifteenth day.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stagliano, a striking technician who was part of a group of
rain-soaked pickets at Verizon's building at 140 W. St. in New York
Monday, said he was willing to endure the subsidy of instead of his
regular weekly income of $1,110.
</P>
<P>
   ``I equate this to the Pharaoh and the slaves. These people will
treat you like a slave, if you give in to them,'' Stagliano said.
``If you say no, they will respect you and think twice before
pulling this thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other striking employees were not so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Marino, who worked in installation and repairs for six
years at Bell Atlantic before it became Verizon, said he never
imagined that he would be out on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that it would come to this, definitely; I
thought this would last only two or three days,'' said Marino, who
married last month. ``I have to keep going back to my wife and tell
her I don't know what's going to happen. Then she gets worried and
asks what am I going to do.''

 &HT;    Only a year ago, Garcia seemed a threat to Tiger Woods
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Only a year ago, he seemed certain to be the
main threat to Tiger Woods. Coming up one stroke short to Woods in
the 1999 PGA Championship at Medinah, Sergio Garcia won a million
hearts, if not the Wanamaker Trophy, with an eyes-wide-shut miracle
shot from a tree root at the 16th hole and a childlike sprint up
the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   With another PGA starting Thursday at Valhalla Golf Club, a few
things have become obvious since 1999:
</P>
<P>
   a. Not only did Garcia fail to emerge as Woods' most serious
challenger, nobody else did, either.
</P>
<P>
   b. While Garcia has two wins on the European Tour, he has none
on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   c. Overall, the El Nino wave peaked at Medinah and is presently
just a few ripples on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Garcia has become known more for his explosions than
generating the same type of excitement that built so marvelously at
the 1999 PGA.
</P>
<P>
   At a European Tour event last year, he threw a shoe down the
fairway after an poor drive, then kicked it.
</P>
<P>
   He has tossed away caddies similarly and already is on his third
as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's British Open, where he finished 10 shots behind
Woods, Garcia made headlines mostly for the final-round, overhead
hack he took on the ninth fairway at St. Andrews. After his drive
landed in what he called a ``3-inch deep super divot,'' Garcia
unsuccessfully tried to strike down on the ball with an 8-iron and
exit the lie. Upset when the club's face closed and the ball
squirted left (though he still made par), Garcia slammed his club
into the ground, causing heads to shake in the gallery, getting a
scolding from the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club and a fine from the
European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to discourage Garcia from showing his emotions, even on
those out-of-control occasions, would be to stifle his game, said
countryman Miguel Angel Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a big temper, but that's good,'' Jimenez said. ``It
pushes you to play good golf. He's a great player. He hits the ball
wonderful. There is a lot of potential in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods in the beginning, Garcia has made some judgment
errors, such as last spring during Atlanta's BellSouth Classic,
practicing for the Masters 20 minutes down the road at the Golf
Club of Georgia and refusing a sponsor's exemption.
</P>
<P>
   A young man who in small interview sessions does not always ooze
the charm he saves for network TV cameras, Garcia demanded that
writers merely call him ``Sergio,'' dropping the surname even on
first mention. Later, Garcia decided he no longer wanted to be
called ``El Nino,'' even though the name remained on his cap, his
golf bag and was used in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Garcia has fumed about losing a spot in the
upcoming $5 million NEC Invitational because of an internal
decision by the same European Tour that has so warmly embraced him.
He has emphasized the PGA Tour this year, earning $486,813 (72nd)
for 11 events. With a limited European Tour schedule, he's 32nd on
the Order of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for something to ignite his game, Garcia found some
success from a switch to cross-handed putting toward the end of the
U.S. Open. Yet, that's not a great indicator, either, to be
switching putting styles within a major championship. It's
anybody's guess how a made-for-TV match against Woods will go Aug.
28, in the sequel to last year's so-so prime-time contest that
Woods won against David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics wonder whether Garcia at this stage has the
patience to contend consistently. Some think his mental game, while
possessing the same brashness and confidence that used to drive
mentor Seve Ballesteros, is as loose as his backswing. At least
Sergio is saying he has to be patient. His comments nearly mirror
those made by Woods in late 1996 and early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have to take my time,'' said the Spaniard. ``If I
won now, it will be great, but (people forget) I'm 20 years old.
I'm hopefully going to play a lot of majors and hopefully I'll be
lucky to win some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Garcia, while fully aware that Woods is the man
he must conquer to excite Europe, realizes that several other
players worldwide, not just Woods, are knocking him down
leaderboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you focus in on one player and you're trying to do
some of the stuff he does and be as consistent as him, it can be
bad, because you forget about yourself. You've got to try to be
your own person and realize that sometimes you're going to have bad
tournaments. You just try to be yourself and just try to play your
own game,'' Garcia said.

 &HT;    Use of Mother Teresa's name sends two churches into court
 &HT;    By Christopher Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - A holy war is brewing over who has the right to use
the name of Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Two churches, one huge, one tiny, are laying claim to the name
of the late Nobel Peace Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny independent church in Woodstock named itself after the
venerated nun, but the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta and
the Missionaries of Charity, the group founded by Mother Teresa,
have sued, saying they have exclusive rights to her name.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Coles, attorney for the archdiocese and the Missionaries
of Charity, said Mother Teresa was a Roman Catholic and in union
with the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants are neither,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Woodstock's Mother Teresa Parish of the Catholic
Church of North America uses her name to attract members and
contributions, but its practices conflict with the teaching of the
Roman Catholic Church. That harms the Roman Catholic Church's
reputation, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize in 1979 for her work among the
poor in India. She died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother Teresa Parish is affiliated with about 70 other
independent Catholic churches, members of a group based in
Louisville, Ky., who call themselves ``Old Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their masses follow the Roman Catholic style, but their beliefs
differ on issues such as infallibility of the pope, and the
veneration of Mary and the saints.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Richard Roberts, a former Episcopalian ordained by the
Catholic Church of North America, helped start the Mother Teresa
Parish. He said she was an example for Christians and that the
Roman Catholic Church can't copyright the ideals she represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that a church per se can own a name,'' Roberts
said. ``Whether someone is doing good works or not shouldn't be
locked into an association with one denomination or another.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits claims otherwise, saying the the Missionaries of
Charity and the Archdiocese of Atlanta are ``exclusively entitled
to control the use of Mother Teresa's name'' in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and the Rev. Kieran Pavlick have from a dozen to 20
worshippers at Saturday and Sunday services at their modest chapel
in a strip shopping center. Both men support themselves with jobs
outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking legal action, the archdiocese asked the church to
drop the name, Coles said. The lawsuit doesn't seek damages; it
asks only that the church stop using Mother Teresa's name and pay
the Roman Catholic Church's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said they want to stick with the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we are taking Mother Teresa's name in vain and
trying to make her out in some bad light. We are hoping we can work
it out, but you're never sure .''

HIDE THE TOOTHPASTE: THE NRA IS BARING ITS TEETH AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   I never went to summer camp as a
kid, partly because I couldn't find a place that offered a suitable
mix of bugle-free mornings, marathon wiffleball games, and all the
ice cream I could eat. Looking back, I doubt ``the Whittington
Adventure'' would have made my short list.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a camp run by the National Rifle Association on a ranch in
New Mexico. For $725 each, according to a story last week in USA
Today, kids between the ages of 13 and 17 spend two weeks learning
to shoot guns, track deer, slap together a meal of forest food,
pitch a tent, and revel in other outdoorsy activities.
</P>
<P>
   They also engage in their share of pranks, apparently. USA Today
recounts a stern lecture campers got for smearing toothpaste on the
handles of cabin doors. The smell attracted a bear, which a camp
counselor had to shoo with a slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's Web site, at www.nrawc.org, fondly recalls the days
of Kit Carson, when ``puffs of black powder smoke drifted into the
clear mountain skies as buckskin-clad hunters brought down mule
deer and elk, antelope and bear.'' The camp acknowledges, however,
that we live in a different era, when kids with guns are too often
cause to scream and run for 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my teacher asked where I was going for the summer, I'd just
say adventure camp, not NRA shooting camp,'' camp-goer Tucker
Phelps, 17, told USA Today. ``I don't want my teachers to be scared
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp includes sensitivity training, with pointers on how to
deal with people who are offended by hunting or guns. Kids are
advised, for instance, not to walk into a restaurant with a gun or
hunting knife on their belts and blood on their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, campers also learn to view the world
through the NRA's scope. Guns are guns, never ``weapons.''
Restricting guns makes as much sense as restricting wiffleball
bats. And, of course, guns don't kill people, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Whittington Adventure sounds like fun. Long walks in
the woods (in blaze orange) would be relaxing, and I could use help
pitching a tent that won't collapse in a brisk breeze. All in all,
though, the camp isn't my sort of place.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I can see why some kids and parents think it's a
valuable experience. In some ways, I'm a knee-jerk liberal on gun
issues. But I understand the desire to keep a firearm in one's
house for protection. Hunting doesn't repulse me; I come from a
long line of folks who hunted. And, although I wince at the
possibility of an NRA camp drawing troubled teens who are too
gung-ho about guns, I've known kids who went through similar
training and didn't grow up to be trigger-happy or murderous. The
experience may have done them some good.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll probably be thinking of Whittington sensitivity
training when I view the ads that the NRA will run this week during
the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The gun group is planning to spend about $1 million on TV
commercials. Charlton Heston, as usual, is the star. ``From
anti-gun mayors and marchers to gun-hating celebrities and
politicians, they're almost all Democrats,'' he booms. ``Tell me:
Why are so few Democrats willing to defend constitutional
freedoms?''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like somebody smeared toothpaste on the cabin door again.
</P>
<P>
   I know some Democrats unjustly demonize all gun owners as bears
on a rampage. I can't understand, however, the froth and foam that
Heston routinely works up for every gun-control measure.
</P>
<P>
   I've yet to see a gun law enacted in this country that's a real
threat to freedom. The Brady law? A minor inconvenience to
law-abiding gun owners. Trigger locks? Ditto. One-gun-a-month
limits on gun purchases? Hardly a hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, criminals will always find a way to get a gun. But I'm
baffled by why we shouldn't put as many obstacles in front of them
as possible to make their ``work'' harder. Because gun hobbyists
want to get weapons, no questions asked? Please. Because an armed
citizenry is a protection against an authoritarian government?
Doubtful. Taken a look at the Pentagon arsenal lately?
</P>
<P>
   The NRA says it promotes gun safety. At the Whittington
Adventure, it apparently does. Much of the rest of the time,
though, the group's leaders unintelligently bear their teeth and
growl.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make me want to stand guard over my toothpaste.

 &HT;    SANCHEZ CANCELS DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION SPEECH
 &HT;    By ANDREW ALEXANDER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rep. Loretta Sanchez, forced by top Democratic
officials last week to move a Hispanic fund-raiser from the
politically incorrect Playboy Mansion, surprised party leaders
Monday by withdrawing as a convention speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Her cancellation was an unwelcome distraction for party
officials trying to project harmony as they opened their convention
to nominate Vice President Al Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to write a speech, and I don't have time to
give a speech,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old California congresswoman is co-chair of the
Democratic National Committee and was head of Gore's congressional
political action committee two years ago. She emerged as one of the
national's most prominent Latino officials in 1996 when she
unseated conservative Republican Robert Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone here respects the decision she made,'' said
Rick Hess, deputy press secretary for the Democratic National
Convention. ``She's a strong leader in our party and someone we
respect. This is a small event in a very large convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was to be one of the convention speakers at Monday's
opening session.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision early Monday rekindled a fiery controversy that
party leaders thought had been doused. It erupted late last week
when Sanchez refused to move the event after party leaders said the
Playboy Mansion venue could embarrass Gore, who is trying to show
he cares about family values.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez caved in and shifted the event to B.B. King's Blues Club
at Universal Studios's CityWalk, a touristy strip of shops and
restaurants, after Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe
Andrew stripped her of her speaking role and threatened to remove
her as party co-chair.
</P>
<P>
   The flap subsided, and her speaking slot was restored. But
Sanchez then found herself the target of critics who accused her of
yielding to moralists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some suggested that I changed the event (location) to get my
speaking slot back. That's not true,'' Sanchez said Monday in an
interview with CNN from the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   By not speaking, she said, she would have more time to
concentrate on fund-raising for Hispanic Unity USA, a political
action committee she heads. The Playboy Mansion fund-raiser was for
that group.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanic leaders have said Sanchez is primarily to blame
for not switching the fund-raiser location after Gore campaign and
party leaders first voiced concern.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor Monday night, Texas state Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos of Austin, a co-chair of his state's delegation, said
Sanchez brought the problems on herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all the details, but I know there were
discussions with her in advance,'' said Barrientos. ``Some people
don't think she was treated fairly, but some of that she should
have known was going to be coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Wilkes, executive director of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, said the controversy is ``a story everyone is
aware of'' among the group's 115,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The League, the nation's oldest and largest Hispanic
organization, has not taken an official position on the issue
because ``it's more an internal thing ... within the (Democratic)
party.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I think it's a little confusing to us why she
would have pressed the issue if the Gore campaign thought it was a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanic delegates said they were both disappointed and
relieved that Sanchez would not appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate because I thought she had some
positive things to say on the major issues that we're trying to
focus on, but it would have taken away from what we're trying to
accomplish here,'' said Bob Henriquez, a delegate from Tampa, Fla.
``If she had spoken, you would have had all the talking heads
talking about it before and after her speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia Garcia, a delegate from Miami, said she felt it was
``unfortunate that where a fund-raiser was being held caused a
problem. I do believe it was a mistake to have planned it for there
because we don't want to give the Republicans a chance to attack
our party as immoral when, of course, we're not immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is she has done a lot for Hispanic women, for
Hispanic Democratic women, and none of that is being highlighted,''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>

The Palm Beach Post contributed to this report, as did the
Associated Press).

CHIRON AGREES TO BUY ANTIBIOTIC MAKER FOR $700 MILLION

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to bolster its portfolio of products, the Chiron Corp.
said Monday that it had agreed to pay $700 million in cash to
acquire the PathoGenesis Corp., a developer of antibiotics. Chiron
will pay $38.50 a share, almost 18 percent higher than
PathoGenesis' closing price of $32.75 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron has been searching for about two years for companies to
acquire, but this is the first deal it has made. Its difficulty in
finding a mate stems in part from the sizzling rise in
biotechnology stocks since last fall, driven by investor excitement
over the unraveling of the human genome sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in stock prices _ the Nasdaq biotechnology index is
up 37 percent this year, though down from its peak in March _ has
made acquisitions more costly. It has allowed biotechnology
companies to raise a record amount of money this year in public
stock offerings, making many companies feel rich enough to go it
alone rather than seek a partner.
</P>
<P>
   PathoGenesis, however, was an exception. In early June, with its
stock trading at about half its current level, the eight-year-old
company, which is based in Seattle, put itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur H. Gantz, the company's chairman and chief executive,
said in an interview that PathoGenesis was expected to become
profitable in the fourth quarter of this year based on sales of its
one drug, an inhaled antibiotic to treat lung infections in people
with cystic fibrosis. The company needed more research muscle and
an international sales force, he said. It would have had trouble in
the future fulfilling Wall Street's expectations for steadily
rising earnings on the income from one drug while spending heavily
to develop others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there has to be mergers in this industry in order to
get critical mass,'' said Gantz, who is expected to leave the
company after the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   PathoGenesis had $60 million in sales last year of its drug,
called TOBI. It is developing several other antibiotics that have
not yet begun clinical trials. The company recently had a paper in
the journal Nature disclosing a new class of compounds that seems
effective in laboratory tests and in mice against strains of
tuberculosis that are resistant to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Lance, Chiron's chief executive, said in a conference call
with analysts that the acquisition would help make Chiron ``a
global player in infectious disease and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiron, based in Emeryville, Calif., sold its diagnostics and
vision products businesses in the the late 1990s, giving it a $1.5
billion war chest to spend on building up its portfolio of drugs by
internal development and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The company suffered setbacks this year when a drug for
osteoarthritis and another for cardiovascular disease both failed
to show effectiveness in clinical trials. Investors were lukewarm
on the acquisition of PathoGenesis, apparently having hoped the
company would make a bigger acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chiron's fell $1.9375, or 4 percent, to $46.6875.
PathoGenesis rose $5.21875, to $37.96875.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that Chiron has been looking to make a strategic
acquisition for well over a year, the market was somewhat
underwhelmed that it wasn't bigger than it is,'' said Dennis R.
Harp, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. But he said the
acquisition made sense for Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Sulat, Chiron's chief financial officer, said the
company was still looking for other acquisitions. ``This doesn't
use up all our cash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron executives said they expected steady growth in sales of
TOBI, the PathoGenesis drug. Now available in the United States,
Britain and Canada, it was approved last week for sale in 15
European countries. Pathogenesis has been testing the drug for use
against other respiratory infections and has been working on a new
type of inhaler that would be quicker and easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron has two drugs of its own for infectious diseases that are
in late-stage clinical trials, one for AIDS and one for sepsis, a
severe inflammatory condition caused by bacterial infection. The
company already sells a drug called Proleukin for kidney cancer and
melanoma and makes a drug sold by Schering A.G. for multiple
sclerosis. Chiron also makes vaccines and test kits used by blood
banks to detect viruses in donated blood.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron said it would take charges against earnings when the
acquisition closes in the third or fourth quarter of this year. The
purchase will lower earnings per share in 2001 but will add to
earnings by 2003, it said.

A BIG GREEN CONSPIRACY
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if yard work weren't unpleasant enough, it now appears that
our plants may be talking about us behind our backs.
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers at Kyoto University in Japan, plants
have the ability to ``talk'' to one another via chemical signals.
Lima bean plants, for example, deter impending attacks by spider
mites by emitting a chemical that wards off the mites while at the
same time attracting the mites' natural predators.
</P>
<P>
   While this may or may not account for my lifelong dislike of
lima beans, it certainly makes me wonder what plants talk about
during those peaceful interludes between insect attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The weather would seem a logical topic, given the fact that
plants are exposed to it day and night and are pretty much at the
mercy of the elements. This implies that plant conversations are
just as boring as most human conversations, consisting of comments
like ``Hot enough for you?'' and ``Boy, we could sure use some
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   However, my experience with plants suggests that maudlin
conversations of this sort are few and far between. Plants are
prickly by nature and generally underwhelmed by any humans who
venture into their vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that you can improve the health of a plant by talking
to it is not only foolish but potentially dangerous. The plant just
wants you to get close so it can spray you with insect-attracting
chemicals or jab a thorn in your eye. Before you know it, the whole
room smells like burned lima beans and spider mites are crawling
down your pants.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that most plant conversations are carping and
hypercritical, an understandable attitude given the fact that they
spend their entire lives rooted in dirt. Plants also have an
agenda, which is nothing short of world domination. Humans often
interfere with this goal, whether by rain forest destruction or
simply careless mowing, which is why we're seen as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I learned early is that plants can sense weakness,
which is why I always carry a bottle of Roundup with me whenever I
venture into the yard, even if it is only to pick up the paper.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of each year, I also conduct a State of the
Yard address in which I evaluate the previous year's performance
(thriving weeds, listless effort on the part of winter rye, some
invisible rapacious thing chewing holes in citrus leaves) and spell
out what I expect in the coming year (verdancy on par with Selby
Gardens, redoubled efforts on the cinch bug front, hold summit with
leaders of mole-cricket coalition).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the remark, the plants will either wave their
tendrils in an approving fashion or visibly wither, a sign that
they do not share my vision of a proud, strong, hard-working garden
that is accepting of all plants regardless of species,
drought-tolerance or abundance of chlorophyll.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements are bound to occur, but I think as long as I keep
the lines of communication open, my lawn and garden will learn to
flourish, preferably with little or no involvement on my part.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, I'll continue keeping the jug of Roundup
close at hand, just in case.

 &HT;    TEXAS LAWMAKER WORKS TO REBUILD STATE DEMOCRATIC DOMINANCE
 &HT;    ATTN TEXAS PAPERS
 &HT;    By DAVE MCNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That balding guy with glasses you may see near the
Texas microphone at the Democratic National Convention here is
probably unknown to most people outside the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to co-chairing the Texas delegation, and
throwing a party for Texas delegates here Monday night featuring
the Austin western swing band ``Asleep at the Wheel,'' Martin Frost
plays a significant role in trying to keep Texas Democratic
officeholders from going the way of the dodo bird.
</P>
<P>
   That includes himself. Frost, 58, elected in 1978, is the
longest-tenured Democrat in the Texas delegation in the U.S. House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Frost has managed to survive several attempts to redistrict him.
With a Democrat in the White House and no Texas Democrats to
exercise authority in the U.S. Senate, Frost also oversees the
process of picking nominees for federal judgeships in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And as chair of the Democratic Caucus, he's the third-ranking
figure in the Democratic power structure, behind minority leader
Dick Gephardt and whip David Bonior.
</P>
<P>
   But Frost's influence has made the most difference for Texas
Democrats in trimming the length of George W. Bush's coattails.
He's done it by using his position as chairman of the Democratic
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Campaign Committee for the past four years to
steer a bundle of money into Texas _ including $3 million in the
2000 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Battleground Program targeted races where Texas
Democrats in Congress and the state legislature were threatened, as
well as open House seats. Part of the reason was looking forward to
2001, when the state legislature will re-draw legislative and
congressional districts _ a process the Democrats have controlled
for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to hold on to the state House (currently with a 78-72
Democratic edge),'' Frost said in an interview here. ``We hope to
pick up control of the state senate (now 16-15 Republican).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do one of those two things _ if we were to lose
both houses of the legislature _ then we would have dire problems
with congressional redistricting. We would have a hard time
recruiting candidates for statewide office for 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost said he jumped in partly because he saw statewide
Democratic officeholders rapidly being voted out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Necessity is the mother of invention,'' Frost said. ``We had
to do it. There were no options for us. If we hadn't funded the
Battleground Program in `98, there's a serious question whether
(Democrat Pete) Laney would be speaker (of the Texas House of
Representatives) today, or whether Democrats would still be in a
majority in the U.S. House delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was pretty extraordinary, because we re-elected
all 17 Democratic congressmen in 1998, and picked up a state senate
seat, and held on to the state house, while Bush was getting more
than 68 percent statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost says Texas could provide some of the six additional seats
needed for the Democrats to take over control of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are in good shape to hold onto their current 17
seats, and are making strong challenges to pick up the 5th and 14th
district seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the 5th, which stretches from Dallas to Bryan, Democrat
Regina Montoya Coggins of Dallas is mounting a stiff and
well-funded challenge to Republican Pete Sessions of Dallas. In the
14th, which stretches from Austin to the Gulf Coast, Democrat Loy
Sneary of Bay City is trying again to unseat Republican Ron Paul of
Lake Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible Bush could carry the state for president, and we
could gain two congressional seats,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, and the Democrats hold the Texas House and win
a Senate majority, Frost's fellow Democrats will be happy to give
him a lot of the credit.

 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Online music company MP3.com Inc. is planning to
take the business of selling music back where it came from _
brick-and-mortar retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com on Monday announced it had struck a deal with a budding
company that is planning a string of stores and entertainment
complexes where music fans could use computer kiosks equipped to
digitally download different songs from different artists using
MP3's site. They could then ``burn'' custom-made compact discs for
$1 a title.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 partner Outernet Inc. isn't set to open its first location
until September, in Apple Valley, Minn., but it has grand plans. By
the end of the year, it wants to open stores in Dallas, Chicago and
New York, and by July it wants to be in Atlanta and about 15 other
big cities, according Paul Uhlemann, vice president of Edina,
Minn.-based Outernet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be able to come in and browse and burn,'' Uhlemann
said, adding that Outernet shoppers also will be able to download
and create custom CDs of games, software and other content.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating customized music CDs is nothing new. Major
record labels as well as retailers worldwide are testing similar
ideas that would let customers create a CD with, say, a Frank
Sinatra tune on one track and a Rage Against the Machine song on
another.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of San Diego-based MP3.com, however, represents
the next step in the ongoing evolution of online music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com and other online music companies have been positioning
themselves to look less like underground music pirates and more
like traditional businesses _ and find ways to make a profit along
the way. In recent months, MP3.com has forked over tens of millions
to settle copyright suits by several major record labels, and is
still negotiating settlement of others.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the shift is the highly-publicized Napster Inc.
copyright infringement case. The recording industry won an
injunction last month against Napster after a federal judge in San
Francisco found that Napster's service violated record companies'
copyrights. That injunction was stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Although music fans will still be able to download and store
music from MP3.com using their home computers, the Outernet kiosks
could let them do it more quickly and easily _ especially if they
lack high-speed Internet access. It would also give MP3.com a
potential new revenue stream and also some exposure outside the
world of home computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this relationship with the Outernet perfectly
illustrates our resolution to give consumers access to the great
music they want, while creating revenue possibilities for digital
artists,'' MP3.com Executive Vice President Steve Sheiner said in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
   But since MP3.com and other online music businesses typically
work with relatively unknown artists who play for cheap, the
big-name record labels and the retailers they work with may have
the advantage as downloadable music moves into retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the choice of artists that you get,'' with
MP3.com, said Malcolm Maclachlan, media and e-commerce analyst with
researcher International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cool idea, and it shows that MP3.com is being forward
in their thinking, but it's not a world-changer,'' he said.

CARTER BACK IN CONVENTION SPOTLIGHT; FUND-RAISER STAYS AWAY FROM
LIMELIGHT; A RIVALRY IN NEW YORK; CLINTONS AT STREISAND
FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD WEINRAUB and ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four years ago, Jimmy Carter conspicuously avoided
the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His relationship
with the incumbent presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, was testy.
Put bluntly, the two former Southern governors were both
competitive and uneasy with each other. ``I've always had good
relations with Vice President Gore,'' said Carter, picking his
words carefully, as he spoke over a cellular phone Monday afternoon
from a limousine as he rode to a reception.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter is back.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the Democratic convention, Carter was
plainly delighted at the half-dozen press interviews and
spontaneous bursts of applause from delegates in the sweltering
streets of Los Angeles. Monday night, Carter was scheduled to be
honored with a five-minute film at the convention, before President
Clinton was to deliver his farewell address as chief executive to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was not planning to attend the convention in Los Angeles.
Four years ago, he had spent convention week at the Montana ranch
of Jane Fonda and Ted Turner. ``At first Al Gore invited me and I
told him I'd prefer not to come and make a big speech,'' said
Carter. ``But then the idea came for a video presentation. It's
been a very, very pleasant experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been such a pleasant experience with Clinton, who
has, nonetheless tried to make amends with Carter in the past year.
Last August Clinton flew to Atlanta to present the Medal of Freedom
to Carter, an obvious effort by the White House to smooth ties with
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The strains between Carter and Clinton were the result of the
former president's intervention in some high-profile humanitarian
and foreign issues, such as Haiti, which collided with the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strong supporters of President Clinton,'' Carter
insisted. But what about tensions with Clinton? ``We haven't had a
close relationship with him,'' said Carter. He spoke warmly about
Gore. ``Whenever there was a problem I called Al Gore,'' he said.
``I always called him. I've known him for 25 years. He's been my
key friend and trusted ally.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's enthusiasm for Carter is not altogether altruistic.
Although George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, is
favored at the moment in numerous southern states, Georgia could
prove a battleground, especially now with its new Democratic
senator, Zell Miller. And Carter could be enlisted to campaign in
the state for the Gore-Lieberman ticket. ``I'll do as requested,''
said Carter, obviously pleased at all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-Raiser Stays Away From Limelight &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one in Hollywood has ever matched Lew R. Wasserman for his
prowess raising tens of millions for the Democratic Party since the
days of John F. Kennedy. Now 87, and a bit frail, Wasserman hosted
one more fund-raiser Monday at his art-filled Beverly Hills home.
Quietly, his associates said, Wasserman is seeking to pass off some
of his political responsibilities onto his grandson, Casey
Wasserman. By the time the next Democratic convention rolls around,
the younger Wasserman may have assumed some, or all, of his
grandfather's fund raising for charities and politicians. In
contrast to younger Hollywood moguls, who crave media attention,
Wasserman, the one-time chairman of MCA, Inc., does not give
interviews and said that he holds no interest in writing a book
about his years in Hollywood because he has always viewed his roles
_ as a talent agent and then executive _ as one of discretion and
privacy. He once told a visitor that his one regret was not having
accepted a top Cabinet job with President Johnson because his wife,
Edie, did not want to leave Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon's guarded event, given by the Wassermans, was
for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Wasserman and his
wife attend parties infrequently now _ although President Clinton
is known to speak frequently to him over the phone. Although
Wasserman is still actively engaged in Democratic politics,
associates acknowledged that the fund-raiser Monday _ and the
current Democratic Convention in his hometown _could mark a final
chapter for Hollywood's most powerful political fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A Rivalry In New York Delegation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York delegation is hardly a vision of party unity,
displaying the not-so-simmering rivalry between two likely
gubernatorial candidates in 2002, State Comptroller Carl McCall and
Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates close to McCall _ which seems to be the majority of
them _ say that Cuomo, who is helping to run Al Gore's presidential
campaign in New York, is using the Gore-New York party apparatus to
help with his own contacts and political future.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo responded: ``How could I possibly be using the Gore
apparatus if I'm not saying anything about the gubernatorial race _
and he is?'' Cuomo was referring to McCall and his energetic,
public efforts here to line up support for his own race for
governor. McCall responded: `If somebody wants to compete with me,
I wish them luck.'' McCall added that he had very briefly said
hello to Cuomo at events here, but no more. `I don't know what kind
of a discussion we would have at this point,'' he said. `I mean,
what would we talk about?'''
</P>
<P>
   Clintons At Streisand Fund-Raiser
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton arrived early and left late (and his wife and
daughter arrived late and left early) at a Sunday brunch at Barbra
Streisand's Malibu compound that is said to have raised $10 million
for the president's library _ the most impressive haul of the
Clintons' prodigious fund raising in Los Angeles this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The brunch was off limits to the press, although a small group
of White House reporters stationed near the event tried to listen
through an immaculately trimmed hedge. A mole at the brunch
provided the following details:
</P>
<P>
   The 60 guests included such longtime Clinton fund-raisers as
Bernard Schwartz, the chairman of the Loral Space and
Communications Corp., the company whose export of satellite
technology to China attracted the scrutiny of Justice Department
investigators; Robert Johnson, the chairman of Black Entertainment
Television Holdings; Alan Patricof, the chairman of Patricof &AMP; Co.
Ventures, a venture capital firm, and Smith Bagley, the grandson of
the tobacco magnate R.J. Reynolds. Bagley's wife, Elizabeth, was
the Clinton administration's ambassador to Portugal until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Streisand and her husband, James Brolin, there were
no other Hollywood celebrities in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Guests started arriving at noon for cocktails near Streisand's
garden of roses overlooking the Pacific. The president arrived
around 12:30 p.m., met privately with Streisand and Brolin, then
schmoozed with guests. The first lady and Chelsea Clinton arrived
some time later, got a lengthy tour from Streisand of her rooms
filled with quilts and American folk art, then sat down to an
outdoor buffet. Both the president and first lady made remarks.
Terry McAuliffe, the Clinton's chief fund-raiser, started off the
speeches, calling Streisand ``the greatest artist of all time.''

WORKERS AT ILLINOIS PLANT SAY THEY ARE NOT TO BLAME FOR TIRE
DEFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also see TIRE-RECALL) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. _ A day after Ford Motor Co. singled out a factory
here that makes Firestone tires as the main source of a problem
that led to the recall of more than 6.5 million tires last week,
workers and union officials said they were not to blame for the
faulty tires.
</P>
<P>
   The workers said Ford might be trying to deflect attention from
possible design flaws in its sport utility vehicles that used the
tires and that the announcement last week by Bridgestone/Firestone
that singled out the Decatur plant could be a pressure tactic in
the company's continuing labor negotiations with the union.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, however, did say they were puzzled by statistical
evidence released by Ford and Firestone that showed that the
Decatur plant, more than any other one, produced a sharply
disproportionate number of defective tires. Indeed, on Sunday, Ford
said it recently discovered evidence that the rate of injury and
damage claims for tires made in Decatur between 1994 and 1996, when
the plant here was largely manned by replacement workers, was often
three to six times that of other factories.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these figures, many factory workers here say they are
skeptical of the evidence because it is inconsistent with the
awards the plant has won and management satisfaction with the jobs
many of them have done for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the all the ``Quality One'' awards they have
received over the years from Ford. And they say that when Firestone
wanted to create a new line of tires, they often came to a huge red
factory building that is spread across 52 acres here in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Werve, a 29-year employee of the factory, said many
workers here thought the cause could be design or engineering
flaws. And they are questioning why Ford was recommending the tires
be inflated with air pressure at 26 pounds per square inch when the
plant recommends and tests the tires at 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at Ford and they're looking back at us,'' he
said Monday. ``It's a chess match. And we're pawns in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though the factory was staffed by replacement
workers when the union went on strike in 1994, union leaders said
Monday that they were unaware of any quality control lapses during
that period and that they did not think the quality of the tires
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any time that the plant put out a bad tire,''
said Roger Gates, president of the union. ``I've never seen the
company jeopardize the product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur workers also bitterly denounced a lawsuit filed in
Florida that contends that there were quality control problems at
the plant for more than a decade, including processes that may have
created faulty tires more prone to splitting apart.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Kaster, a lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has filed suit
against Bridgestone/Firestone, says he has evidence that Decatur
and other Firestone plants were producing flawed and dangerous
tires and that several former Firestone employees from Decatur are
willing to testify that there were many quality control problems at
the plant here and that the demands put on workers contributed to
the production of dangerous tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always an emphasis on quantity and not quality,''
Kaster said Monday. ``A breakdown in quality control in the plant
results in a catastrophe on the highways.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the workers interviewed Monday said they had known about
such conditions, even though many said they were 20- and 30-year
employees. They questioned the motives of the former employees and
said that the plant workers had always taken pride in the tires
they produced and even bought them for their own cars and their own
families, believing they were entirely safe.
</P>
<P>
   The reason so much attention has focused on Decatur, though, is
clearly the bitter union strike that began in 1994. At the time,
there were also strikes at the city's two other major employers:
Caterpillar and A.D. Staley.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the 1,800 workers here walked out after
Bridgestone, a Japanese company that acquired Firestone in 1988,
began making stringent demands to scale back the work force, pay
and vacation time, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good working relations, and we just wanted to keep
things the way they were,'' said John Blair, 67, who decided to
retire after the strike. ``But the Japanese wanted more. They
wanted to cut back on vacation time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers were out for more than a year and angered
when the company hired replacement workers and some union members
crossed the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Coates, 63, said that about that time his wife, a nurse at
the company, was diagnosed with cancer, and he was out of a job
watching people he considered friends cross the picket line.
Harland Smith, who has been with the company more than 30 years,
says it was ugly and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people couldn't survive,'' he said. ``If you wanted a
job, you had to go out of town. Many went to Indianapolis, which is
150 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the workers returned in 1995, the regular eight-hour days
had become 12-hour days where they worked in two and three-day
cycles. The company was demanding more, and some former workers
admit there was often too much pressure to produce, and perhaps
even problems hiring replacement workers skilled enough to produce
quality tires on the company's rigid schedule. But even they doubt
any of that resulted in years of defective tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speculate; I wasn't there,'' Werve said about the
allegations that faulty tires were made during the strike. ``But I
think quality control would have caught it. You know, all we do is
make the tire. Ford and Firestone design it and they test it.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers here also say they would never have engaged in
retaliation because of hard feelings about the strike. They say
they realize how important tires are and they know they're dealing
with human lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them believe a combination of factors are at work. They
speculate about possible design flaws, of pressure on Ford and
Firestone to find answers that will appease a wary public; and
about a handful of former workers who may have some other reason
for saying the quality wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   They say they enjoy their jobs, the pay (at about $18 an hour),
and feel they are being unfairly singled out. Indeed, Decatur, they
say, has been hit again. After the major strikes in the mid 1990s,
the Archer Daniels Midland Co. was rocked by a major price-fixing
scandal; Jesse Jackson came to town recently because of a racial
incident at a local high school. And now, the city they call ``the
Pride of the Prairie'' is being blamed for one of the largest tire
recalls in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' Coates said. ``We went from being the Pride of the
Prairie to Sin City almost overnight.''

MOTORIZED CARTS RECALLED AFTER GIRL'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Idaho, Ind.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday
that about 91,000 motorized recreational carts were being recalled
for safety reasons and that people who had them should stop using
them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Popularly known as go-karts, the vehicles are dangerous because
riders' long hair or loose clothing can become entangled in
rotating parts behind the driver's seat despite guards meant to
prevent such accidents, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the manufacturer, Manco Products of Fort
Wayne, Ind., had received a report of one death _ that of a
13-year-old Idaho girl whose neck was broken when her hair caught
in a drive chain _ and two serious head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The one- and two-seat carts being recalled are powered by
gasoline engines and were sold under the Manco, Phoenix, Fox,
Rattler and Coyote labels from January 1983 through July 2000 for
$600 to $2,000, the agency said. It said Manco was providing free
repair kits.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has placed information on identifying the
dangerous carts by description and serial number on its Web site,
www.cpsc.gov. Further information can be obtained from the
company's Web site (www.mancoprod.com) or by calling the company at
(800) 293-0795, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the manufacturer was cooperating, as it did
in a 1996 recall after a death and serious injuries were linked to
exposed rear axles.  &QL;

 VIRGINIA ADMIRAL, 85, PAINTER , WRITER AND MOTHER OF ACTOR ROBERT
De   NIRO  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Virginia Admiral, an American painter and writer who
studied with Hans Hofmann, died on July 27. She was 85 and lived in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral was born in Oregon and studied at the Art Institute of
Chicago. While working on the Federal Arts Project in Oakland,
Calif., in 1938, she became closely involved with the San Francisco
poetry scene. With the poet Robert Duncan she published a single
issue of a small-press magazine, Epitaph, which developed into The
Experimental Review. Later, in New York, she wrote for True Crimes
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she enrolled at the Hofmann School in New York to study
painting, where she met the artist Robert De Niro, who was working
as a class monitor. They married in 1942; their son, the actor
Robert De Niro, was born in 1943 and lives in New York City.
Admiral's husband died in 1993. She is survived by a sister,
Eleanor Haefele of Sacramento, and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Admiral exhibited in the Springs Salon for Young
Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in
Manhattan. She had a solo show there in 1946 and was included in
the Peggy Guggenheim Collection at the Venice Biennale in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Admiral was active in the antiwar movement, often
contributing work to shows based on political themes. She was also
instrumental in establishing low-cost housing for artists in SoHo.
From 1973 to 1980 she showed at Buecker and Harpsichords gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Peggy
Guggenheim Collection in Venice. &QL;

 &HT;    Cutcliffe asks fans for patience with Manning waiting in wings
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mississippi coach David Cutcliffe spoke to booster clubs
around the state this summer, he asked one thing of his team's
fans: Don't create a quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand Cutcliffe's concern. Mississippi senior
Romaro Miller was the SEC's fourth-leading passer last season,
throwing for 1,999 yards and 14 touchdowns. He threw only seven
interceptions in 270 pass attempts and led the Rebels to their
third consecutive bowl game, a feat the program hadn't accomplished
since playing in 15 bowl games in a row from 1957-71.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's backup is getting a lot of attention in Oxford. The
optimism has nothing to do with what he's done on the field. It has
everything to do with his last name.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Eli Manning, a redshirt freshman, faces even loftier
expectations than his older brother, Peyton Manning, endured at
Tennessee. Not only must he play in the large shadow of his
brother, now a star quarterback for the NFL's Indianapolis Colts,
but he'll also draw comparisons to his father, Archie Manning, a
two-time All-American at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Cutcliffe knows there is pressure to put a Manning under center.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Manning name out there, I decided before I went out
on my (speaking) circuit that I was going to ask our fans to be
responsible,'' Cutcliffe said. ``On every team I've ever coached,
the backup quarterback has always been the most popular player on
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutcliffe, who begins his second full season at Mississippi, was
Tennessee's offensive coordinator during Peyton Manning's
record-setting career in Knoxville. He avoids comparing the two
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eli has done everything I've asked him to do as a redshirt,''
Cutcliffe said. ``That's a big deal because a lot of guys just sit
on their redshirt year and don't do anything. But he went to work
in the weight room and it paid off in the spring. If you haven't
seen him, he looks like a completely different person. I'm anxious
to see how he looks on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   So are Mississippi fans, who were outraged when Peyton Manning
snubbed his father's alma mater and signed with the Volunteers. Eli
Manning, 6 feet 4 and 200 pounds, was the 1998 USA Today player of
the year in Louisiana after he threw for 2,381 yards and 30
touchdowns as a senior at Isadore Newman School in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Eli is that he's comfortable with being
Eli, and we're going to let him do that,'' Cutcliffe said. ``He's
not chasing Peyton or trying to be Peyton.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says he's comfortable with the situation, too. Miller,
who has a 15-8 record in two years as a starter, needs only 454
yards to surpass Archie Manning as the school's fourth-leading
passer of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no animosity between us,'' Miller said, referring to
Eli Manning. ``We're great friends. I think when you've got a
player like Eli behind you, it only makes you better.
</P>

 AT THIS CONVENTION, IT'S JESSE JACKSON Jr. IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At Democratic conventions past, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson wrote a compelling piece of the story line. The 1988
convention in Atlanta, for instance, was consumed with the question
of how warmly Jackson would embrace Michael Dukakis, who had
defeated him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's convention, however, Jackson's son and namesake,
Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., is the one making waves by giving public
voice to the concerns within the party's left wing about its
centrist ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Saturday, at a forum at the University of Southern
California, when the third-term Chicago Democrat was asked whether
people should vote for Vice President Al Gore. ``The only option is
Al Gore,'' he responded. ``But if there was another campaign that
was speaking to our issues that had the possibility and
plausibility of winning, we should support that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at another forum, this one part of the ``Shadow
Convention'' organized by a coalition of left-leaning groups,
Jackson made it clear that he would campaign aggressively for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket. But he continued to cast his decision as one
driven more by his fear of the alternative _ electing Gov. George
W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after the speech, Jackson said: ``I am
supporting Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman and I'm doing it as
enthusiastically as I can. But Jackie Wilson is not on the ticket,
and Elvis Presley is not on the ticket, so Mr. Excitement is not
running for president. This is about pragmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a sentiment the Gore campaign needs as it tries to
generate enthusiasm for its candidate, not simply against its
opposition, and seeks to motivate a traditional base that include
minorities, women and union members. Jackson said he would try to
persuade disillusioned liberal Democrats from defecting to Ralph
Nader and the Green Party. And he criticized the Gore campaign's
recent emphasis on restoring the country's sense of morality,
something his vice presidential choice, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, has
emphasized throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start getting into this personal-life litmus test we
are deep in Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson territory,'' the
younger Jackson said, ``and that is unfamiliar Democratic real
estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Jackson, meanwhile, has not stayed silent, and on
Monday made essentially the same point as his son. ``If it means we
have to hold our noses and take castor oil, do it,'' the elder
Jackson urged a group of voters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Minority voters, the elder Jackson said, would become enthused
about voting Democratic when they begin to view the campaign as a
choice not just between presidential candidates but between
distinct ideologies. ``Gore and Lieberman are quarterbacks but the
team is much broader than that,'' he said in an interview. ``And
when I see what our alternatives are I am inspired to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Jackson is scheduled to speak at the convention on
Tuesday night. Though he has had starring roles at past
conventions, he said he was not bothered by the fact that he was
slated to appear before network television coverage begins.
``Whenever I speak,'' he said, ``it's prime time.''

2 MEN FROM KAZAKHSTAN CHARGED IN E-MAIL EXTORTION OF BLOOMBERG 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On March 24, a strange e-mail message popped on the computers at
the Bloomberg corporate offices in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the message, addressed to the financial-information company's
founder and chief executive, Michael Bloomberg, a person named Alex
claimed detailed knowledge of the financial information company's
computer system. Alex said he was ``not a criminal,'' but claimed
to have obtained passwords of senior Bloomberg employees and
proposed that Bloomberg pay him for pointing out the security
breach. Alex closed the electronic missive by stating ``(y)our
security and reputation are in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a fax machine rang at the Bloomberg offices.
Streaming out of the machine came computer screen printouts with
confidential corporate files, including Bloomberg's employee
photograph, his computer password, and his personal credit card
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a cat-and-mouse game pitting the mysterious Alex
against FBI agents and Bloomberg employees acting under their
direction. After exchanging a series of computer messages Bloomberg
agreed to deposit $200,000 in a European bank on Alex's promise
that he would reveal how he had cracked Bloomberg's security and
help the company's programmers shore up their defenses. FBI agents
and the Bloomberg employees then persuaded the mysterious
correspondent to travel to London for a meeting. Bloomberg agreed
to attend himself.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in the Hilton Hotel in London last Thursday, the
agents sprang their trap. London police officers arrested two men
who attended. Monday, federal prosecutors in New York unsealed
criminal complaints against Oleg Zezov, 27, and Igor Yarimaka, 37,
charging them with unauthorized computer intrusion and extortion.
If extradited to the United States for trial and convicted on all
counts, each man faces as much as 20 years in federal prison,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are from Kazakhstan, authorities said, and according to
the complaint, Yarimaka claimed to be a former prosecutor in that
former Soviet state northwest of China.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Zezov gained access to the Bloomberg system
through a securities company he worked for in Almaty, Kazakhstan's
former capital.
</P>
<P>
   For a financial information company such as Bloomberg, which
uses computers to provide financial data to more than 200,000
customers around the world, some of whom trade stocks and bonds
over the network, computer security is critical. Officials at the
company said Monday that they were continually upgrading their
systems to prevent unauthorized intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as confident as anyone can be that the security of our
system was, is, and continues to be adequate to protect our
customers,'' Chris Taylor, a company spokesperson said. ``We are
100 percent confident that they did not gain access to any of our
customers' data.'' Taylor did not want to comment further, although
the company issued a brief statement about the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In detailed criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, federal agents described how they used their computers
to track the person calling himself Alex at the same time they
arranged the meeting in London. In the computer messages listed in
the complaint, Alex referred to the Bloomberg system as ``a toy for
hackers.'' At the same time assuring Bloomberg that he meant no
harm to his company, Alex also insisted on payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honest and well-intentioned person as far as you could
see,'' one message read, according to the complaint. ``But I can't
give up my principles and in any case will get my money for done
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail goes on to suggest that Bloomberg deposit $200,000 in
an off-shore bank account. If the money is received, Alex wrote,
the information on the company would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case of nonpayment, I'll send the report to your clients,''
the e-mail said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Bloomberg opened an account at a
Deutsche Bank office in London and deposited $200,000. The account
was set up so that Alex could confirm the money was present, but
could not transfer or withdraw the funds. A few days later, Alex
requested ``total control'' of the account and asked that Bloomberg
release $7,500 for travel expenses for the proposed meeting in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI learned that the $7,500 was electronically transferred
to a bank in Riga, Latvia. Soon after, on July 25, Alex sent an
e-mail to Bloomberg agreeing to meet in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to meet with you,'' the e-mail said.
``Today is my birthday, 27 years old. And on this day I don't want
you to think about me bad.''
</P>
<P>
   At the London meeting, the complaint says, Bloomberg told the
two men he was concerned they were extorting money from his
company. Yarimaka said they were not criminals, and that ``Alex''
had not broken any criminal laws in his country. He was concerned
that Bloomberg had used the term extortion.

BRADY TRAINED WITH TALENTED BUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Marcus Brady didn't have a typical offseason. The
Cal State Northridge quarterback lifted weights and participated in
drills with the likes of Cris Carter, Randy Moss and Dante
Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   Brady participated in Carter's two-week program with some of
college and pro football's elite in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Brady said. ``It was the same thing. It was me
out there training and working hard to get better. I got to see the
level they're at and I feel I was right there with them at that
level. I've got a lot of confidence in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Brady was throwing passes to Drew Amerson, Gil
Rodriguez and a host of newcomers at the first practice for veteran
Matadors. Brady is expected to embrace the leadership role for
CSUN, which finished 6-5 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fun to get back on the field,'' Brady said. ``In the
summer, when you first go it's exciting, but the summer is so long.
I was antsy to get back on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Ryerson _ who's listed as the second-string quarterback _
won't be available for CSUN's season opener Sept. 2 at Air Force.
According to coach Jeff Kearin, Ryerson will serve a one-game
suspension for breaking a university policy.
</P>
<P>
   That means Jermaine Guinyard _ a freshman from San Diego Marion
Catholic High _ could be called upon, as well as walk-on Brandon
Martinovic. Kearin plans to redshirt Guinyard this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Guinyard) has a long way to go on the learning curve, but
athletic-wise he's up to the challenge,'' Kearin said. ``He's got a
lot to learn, but he's an intelligent player and an intelligent
student.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kearin has been impressed with Martinovic, a redshirt
freshman from El Cajon Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleasantly surprised at the level he's playing at now,''
Kearin said. ``Mechanically, he's at a different level than where
he was in the spring. I'm excited and happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN will practice in full pads starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Minor injury: Defensive lineman Erik Gardner, one of three
returning defensive starters, has a minor hamstring injury, but it
didn't keep him from participating in two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   __ Excused absence: Defensive tackle Johnny Acosta, a projected
starter, missed practice for personal reasons.

 &HT;    Boy, left in car nearly 9 hours by grandmother, dies
 &HT;    By Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Left alone in a closed car for almost nine hours while
his grandmother worked, a 2-year-old was found dead Monday in the
searing blacktop parking lot of South DeKalb Mall, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They said they assumed excessive heat caused the boy's death,
but added that they would not know for sure until the Medical
Examiner's Office completes an autopsy. They said there were no
signs of trauma on the boy's body.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not release the names of the boy and his
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County police Capt. Paul Taylor said the boy's
grandmother, a Lithonia resident in her early 40s, works at the
Social Security office in the mall. She usually drops the boy off
at a nearby day-care center, but instead kept him in her car
Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said police did not know why the grandmother, who is believed
to have custody of the child, did not leave him in day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important question, and she is being
questioned by police now,'' Taylor said Monday evening. No charges
had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the grandmother reported to work at 7:30 a.m. and
apparently did not check on the child during the day. She found the
boy dead when she returned to her black Pontiac Grand Am, parked
just outside the office, after work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, she discovered the child in the car after
she checked out at 4:15 (p.m.),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same building where the grandmother works houses a DeKalb
police mini-precinct. Despite vehicular and pedestrian traffic in
the parking lot of the busy mall throughout the day, nobody
reported seeing the boy in the car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not guess at the heat in the car. Though Monday
started cool, with a low in the 60s, the temperature climbed to
near 90 in the afternoon. Inside the closed car on the baking
pavement, it would have been far hotter.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of the boy's mother was unknown. A man came to
scene late Monday identifying himself as the child's father, and
was taken away by police.
</P>
<P>
   If heat-related, Monday's tragedy would be the second of its
kind in metro Atlanta in a little over two years. In June 1998,
3-year-old Samuel Oh of Doraville died when a day-care worker
accidentally left him alone in a van in Tucker for more than two
hours on a 95-degree day.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's family later filed suit against Ford, the maker of the
van, contending that it had a moral responsibility to build into
its cars and trucks an automatic ventilation system that would hold
down the heat.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Donzella James (D-Atlanta) during the last
legislative session failed to win passage of a bill that would make
adults responsible if children they left unattended in vehicles
died. She has said she intends to reintroduce the bill next year.

BENNETT OK WITH NOT BEING UCLA QB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To know where Drew Bennett has gone in the last
year, all you had to do was be at UCLA's media day on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, like the rest of his teammates, had his photo taken in
full uniform and then milled around for the next hour, available
for anyone who wanted to interview or photograph him. He waited.
And waited. And waited.
</P>
<P>
   If only he'd had this much time in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a good an indication of how Bennett's life has
changed in the last year, from Cade McNown's heir apparent to
fourth-string split end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was the center of attention,'' Bennett said, as he
sat in the bleachers among a group of similarly anonymous
teammates, far from any reporters or TV cameras who were zeroing in
on Cory Paus and Ryan McCann. ``It's a lot different this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 207-pound senior began last season as the Bruins'
starting quarterback, but by early October he had lost the job to
Paus and switched to receiver, a position where he hopes to put his
considerable athletic ability to use. He also might be the holder
on the field-goal unit.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore, he caught a Hail Mary pass from Cade McNown that
looked as if it would beat Oregon. Kicker Chris Sailer missed a
short field goal before the Bruins won in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as glamorous, but there's not as much stress,''
Bennett said of his new role. ``I just want to play wherever I can.
Switching and getting a chance to play at receiver is better than
being the third- or fourth-string quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``From playing quarterback, I know all the routes and the
coverages, but it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the one thing he misses is having is hands on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plays where you're not going to be looked at,'' he
said. ``Sometimes you might just run a guy off and you know you're
not going to get the ball. At quarterback, no matter what happens,
you're going to touch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like thinking back with all the wouldas, shouldas,
couldas. There are a lot of things different about last season. I
just want to have fun.''

NETWORKS MAY NEED TO IMPROVISE AT CONVENTION OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
  By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like its network morning-show rivals, CBS's
``Early Show'' with Bryant Gumbel was all set to kick off its week
in Los Angeles on Monday with an extensive sitdown interview with
President Clinton and a separate talk with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Lyne Pitts, the program's executive producer, got
the distressing news that the president and first lady were backing
out. They also pulled out of an agreement with NBC's ``Today''
show, and Mr. Clinton decided not to do ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all set,'' Pitts said. ``Bryant was supposed to
interview him Saturday afternoon _ it had been booked for quite
some time. I got the calls at a little bit after 9 in the morning
saying that, sorry, the president's schedule would not accommodate
the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unknown for sought-after newsmakers to bump a news
show or two from their itineraries. But such a wholesale
withdrawal, at a time when the news media was fixated so avidly on
the Clintons, inevitably raised eyebrows. ``We knew Thursday night
how upset the Gore folks were with Clinton's confessional on
Thursday and that would be the talk of our interview,'' Pitts said,
adding it was ``more than an assumption'' that the Clintons had
dropped out to try to turn down the media heat on them a notch or
two. Mrs. Clinton, however, did a round of interviews with anchors
on all of the major broadcast and cable networks on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Though the convention is intended as a crowning television
moment for Vice President Al Gore, it was the sitting president who
weighed most heavily on the minds of editors and producers on
Monday. For the broadcast networks, it was not merely the issue of
Clinton's absence in the morning, but also his presence on Monday
night, as the featured speaker on the convention's opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla surrounding Clinton's appearance seemed to reflect a
sense in the press corps here that Los Angeles may indeed generate
more interesting and entertaining tidbits than did Philadelphia. On
``The Early Show'' for instance, Pitts said that one of the
interview segments on Tuesday would feature Hugh Hefner and his
daughter Christie from the Playboy Mansion. The Hefners, hefty
contributors to Democratic causes, found themselves at the center
of the news in recent days, after Democratic officials pressured
Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Orange County, Calif. to move a benefit out
of the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been the one bit of interesting controversy here,''
Pitts said.
</P>
<P>
   News executives at the big three broadcast networks had
decisions to make about how much of the president's speech to cover
if, as expected, he spoke past 11 p.m. on the East Coast, intruding
on local news shows. Last week the chairman of the Republican
National Committee, Jim Nicholson, had admonished the networks that
it would be unfair to give Clinton more air time than had been
allotted to former Gen. Colin Powell, the featured speaker on the
first night of the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Cable networks are covering the party proceedings nonstop, but
the big three networks are each taking different approaches. On
Monday night, ABC planned to begin an hour of coverage at 10 p.m.,
provided that the preseason ``Monday Night Football'' game ended on
time; CBS planned to insert convention coverage in its ``48 Hours''
news program at 10, and NBC News _ which has shifted most of its
coverage to its cable channel MSNBC _ scheduled its broadcast of
Mr. Clinton's speech for 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   All three networks said that Clinton's speech would be more
newsworthy than General Powell's and probably worth staying with.
(None of three networks ran the general's speech in its entirety.)
``In all respect to Colin Powell, I don't think they're equal in
that one is the president and has been president for eight years,''
said Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC
News.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had another sudden worry: what if Monday night's football
game between the Tennessee Titans and St. Louis Rams ran well past
10? Burstein said that while he did not watch a lot of football,
his understanding was that the evening's matchup was likely to be
largely a passing game, which made it more likely that the game
would move slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nightmare I don't even want to deal with,'' he said.

VALHALLA WILL OFFER A TOUGHER TEST FOR PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ When Valhalla Golf Club played host to its
first major championship in 1996, the weather was hot, but the
course received lukewarm reviews.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1996, when Mark Brooks won the PGA Championship by
one stroke over Kenny Perry, two solid players, but hardly legends.
Meanwhile, the course was criticized for being too easy, with 46
players finishing under par.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the PGA Championship is back at Valhalla, for
the year's final major, which begins Thursday. But this year's
tournament has the potential to be far more memorable than the one
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods did not play at Valhalla in 1996 when he was still
an amateur. Coming off his record-setting victories at both the
U.S. Open and the British Open, Woods could become the first player
to win three consecutive majors since Ben Hogan in 1953. Imagine
the galleries Woods will attract this week. Though Woods will not
arrive at Valhalla until Tuesday, Monday's practice rounds were
heavily attended, and the crowds will be huge once the tournament
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Jack Nicklaus-designed course, which opened in 1986, has
been lengthened and toughened since 1996, and most players who
practiced Monday said the changes were for the better. A more
mature course, a world-class field, enthusiastic galleries and a
major championship at stake seemed like reason enough to give
Valhalla a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of the traditional courses, and it's not the same
style of course we usually play majors on,'' said Jim Furyk, who
tied for 17th here in 1996. ``So there's a lot of talk about the
course. But I'm excited about the week. It's a major championship.
We'd all like to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning will require accuracy off the tee and precise approach
shots into the severely undulating greens. Twelve of the 18 holes
have been altered in some way since 1996, with most of the changes
on the front nine encouraging players to use their driver more
often. The first hole has been lengthened 21 yards to 446 yards,
and the fairway was narrowed at the par 5, 533-yard No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But on paper, Valhalla remains a course where length is not a
prerequisite for winning. Brooks, who won in 1996, is not among the
tour's longest hitters, and the prevailing theory is that Valhalla
may not fit Woods as well as Pebble Beach and St. Andrews did. But
any course fits Woods when he is playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner will be someone who's making putts, who's handling
the greens well,'' said Steve Jones, who won the 1996 U.S. Open.
``Everyone knows Tiger's the best player. He hits the ball great,
but the key to him running away at the U.S. Open was that he made
all those putts for par that kept his momentum going. And at St.
Andrews, his length was a big factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good course. Sure, tradition counts for
something, especially in your own mind. I would've been thrilled to
win any U.S. Open, to win it at Oakland Hills and to have my ugly
mug up there next to someone like Ben Hogan only made it more
special. But this is a major championship, and whoever wins Sunday
will be thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three majors of the year were played at three of
golf's most treasured venues _ the Masters at Augusta National Golf
Club with its unique tradition, the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf
Links with his special beauty, and the British Open at St. Andrews,
a historic site known as the home of golf. Valhalla is following
some tough acts, but the public is certain to become more familiar
with Valhalla in the coming years. The PGA of America, which owns
Valhalla, is bringing the PGA Championship back here in 2006, and
the Ryder Cup will be played here in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The par 4, 470-yard No. 12 is Valhalla's toughest hole, but the
par 5, 542-yard No. 18 could provide the best theater. The
finishing hole features a three-level green that can be reached in
two shots, providing the potential for an eagle finish that could
produce a two-or-three-shot swing.
</P>
<P>
   So with Woods chasing history and the Louisville area ready to
embrace golf's biggest stars, another major championship will be
played at Valhalla. There was a buzz in the air Monday, and it was
only Monday. And once the tournament begins, the venue will not
matter as much to the players as the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's excited to be here, but I hope some guys
aren't,'' Furyk said. ``Maybe that might make it easier for me to
win.''
</P>

NEW MORALISM SEEMS OUT OF PLACE IN GAMEY LA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Philadelphia greeted the Republicans two weeks ago
with the Liberty Bell and cheese steak. LA welcomes the Democrats
with a lot of cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that LA has no soul. Of course it has a soul --
a wondrous thing defined by the lethal smile, the cell phone and
unisex breast reduction. The city traffics in tenderloin and
spreads like an oil slick east from the Pacific, daring you at
every block to cap your teeth, to walk on the wild side and use the
almond mousse. It is a beacon of shamelessness and that's why we
like it.
</P>
<P>
   LA muscles its way into the Democratic convention story as
Philadelphia never did, never could, with the Republicans. Let's
face it, the GOP could have met in Schenectedy and no one would
have known the difference. Not so out here. This gamey place
demands attention and invites trouble. It sits like a pro at the
bar as the amateurs with the Gore pins pour in like locusts from
Elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The libidinous LA ethos clashed last week with the New Moralism
of the Democratic ticket to create l'affaire Sanchez. Until then,
Rep. Loretta Sanchez of nearby Orange County had been a Democratic
poster child, a popular Hispanic who was awarded precious podium
time during the convention this week by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That all ended when she chose to hold a fundraiser for her
political action committee at the Playboy mansion -- you know, the
one with the guy in pajamas and the bunnies. (The bunny suits went
out with the Playboy clubs in 1986 but are making a comeback by
popular demand.)
</P>
<P>
   The entire Democratic establishment, including Rhode Island's
very own Rep. Patrick Kennedy, promptly had a psychotic episode
over her use of the mansion. They were shocked, shocked, that
anyone would hold an event in such a notorious meat market that
denigrates women as sex objects. Democratic National Committe
Chairman Joe Andrew actually pulled the plug on the Sanchez podium
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Way off message, Loretta.
</P>
<P>
   Entranced by the concept of a political future, Sanchez finally
canned the Playboy mansion and all that good clean fun for another
location and her podium spot.
</P>
<P>
   Such hysteria might have been expected in Salem during the witch
trials or maybe Philadelphia, which wallowed in GOP platitudes. But
not here, not in the city where Pia Zadora broke into show biz. The
locals were stunned. The Playboy mansion, after all, has been used
for years to host charity events, and Democrats like former LA
Mayor Tom Bradley and the extraterrestrial former California
governor Jerry Brown have raised money there without a hiccup. So
what gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are devouring their young while the Republicans
sit off in the weeds and let them go at it.'' says Bill Farley, a
Playboy spokesman.'' In the 15 years I've been here, I've never
seen an event at the mansion that has created as much controversy
as this.''
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost. There is still a nifty protest planned by
prostitutes outside of the Staples Center for the decriminalization
of commercial sex. The issue may not be up there with campaign
finance reform but, honestly, wouldn't most folks rather listen to
prostitutes make their pitch than Arianna Huffington motor on about
the evils of the two-party system?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Susan Block, a sex therapist and talk show
host who espouses something called Ethical Hedonism and runs the
eponymous Dr. Susan Block Institute For The Erotic Arts and
Sciences. Block, who promises five-minute foot massages for all
delegates and members of the press, is running an exhibit called
``Democratic Sex'' in her gallery a few blocks from the Staples
Center in honor of this shindig. The show, which celebrates what
Block calls ``the inherent democracy of sex,'' follows earlier
exhibits on Erotic Art of the Apocalypse and on the foot fetish.
Block doubts that the parliament of prostitutes descending on LA
will fare well here. ``The Democrats are too cheap. They go for the
interns'' she says. ``Republicans are better customers because they
spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she adds, forget all the talk back east of earth tones and
alpha male behavior to transform Al Gore into a marketable item.
What the man needs, she maintains, is some mojo. ``He's not a bad
looking guy, but he is sorely in need of some sexual excitement,''
says Block. ``Look at Clinton. he may have pulled his pants down,
but the polls didn't come down with them.''

 &HT;    PROTESTERS OPPOSE GORE'S OIL FIRM INVESTMENT
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hundreds of environmental activists jammed
intersections near the Democratic convention site Monday morning to
demand that Vice President Al Gore sever his ties to the Los
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, featuring giant puppets portraying the evils of
capitalism, proceeded peacefully from a downtown park to the
designated dissent site near the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   But after some protesters refused to leave the area, police
locked batons to herd them away and clear the streets. About a
dozen protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Atossa Soltani, founder of the environmental group Amazon Watch,
told the gathering that the Gore family ties to Occidental ``makes
him no better than Bush.'' He challenged Gore to ``show us you are
an environmental champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Occidental has rights to conduct exploratory drilling a few
miles outside the legal boundaries of the U'wa Indian reserve in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's late father, Al Gore Sr., served on the Occidental board
after losing his Senate re-election bid in 1968. Between $500,000
and $1 million in Occidental stock is currently held in trust for
Gore's mother, Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon Watch released a letter to Gore signed by singer Bonnie
Raitt and actors Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon suggesting that
Gore's decision to retain his Occidental ties was not only a matter
of environmental concern but ``a question of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway dismissed the protests, saying,
``Al Gore has been a champion of the environment his entire public
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, the governor of
Texas, and Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, both have professional
and political ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the environment wasn't all protesters were concerned
about, judging by the variety of messages on the signs they
carried. They ran the gamut from ``One Nation Under Corporation''
to ``Stop Patents of Indigenous Medicines.'' One sign read: ``All
government is bad.''

THE MONEY QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before this campaign is over, the most significant of Senator
Joseph Lieberman's moral targets may not be the licentiousness of
Bill Clinton, but the corruption of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is: While Lieberman's sharp criticism of
Clinton's behavior with Monica Lewinsky helps distance Vice
President Al Gore from that swamp, the senator's work on campaign
finance reform could be an embarrassment to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Their policy positions on the issue are similar, but their
behavior is not. Gore cannot escape his record of fund-raising
phone calls from the White House and the infamous Buddhist temple
fund-raiser right here in Los Angeles _ all in service to the
gluttonous 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in a scathing 1998 Atlantic magazine article, blasted
both Clinton-Gore and the GOP for ``sleazy behavior,'' which he
said ``betrayed the public trust'' and ``effectively hung a giant
FOR SALE sign on our government and the whole of our political
process.
</P>
<P>
   This April, Gore pledged to make campaign finance a major
priority, but, as Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger noted
Monday, ``he hasn't said one thing about it since.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and John McCain proved the issue has political
worth, and Governor George W. Bush's indifference, combined with
his own extraordinary fund-raising juggernaut, create an opening
for the Democrats. But Gore has only jacked up the Democrats' soft
money collections this year, and he broke an agreement with the GOP
by being the first to use that money in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lavish, corporate-dominated convention here _ equal to
the GOP's in Philadelphia _ Gore is vulnerable to questioning from
people like Harshbarger, who asks: ``How credible's the
messenger?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore must begin to answer that question Thursday night.
Lieberman can help, but only if Gore moves to renounce the past
errors that Lieberman identified so pointedly.

A BIG COMEBACK WITH A SMALL, UGLY SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Teammates on the U.S. Olympic squad, Jenny
Thompson and Dara Torres have built an engaging swimming rivalry
that represents both the wonder and suspicion that attends women's
swimming at the elite international level.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry, which continued Monday night in the 100-meter
freestyle, has been a primary story line here in the Olympic trials
that determine the American team for the 2000 Summer Games next
month in Sydney, Australia. Both swimmers had the luxury of knowing
they had qualified in the 100-meter butterfly, in which Thompson
defeated Torres last Thursday. They will meet again Wednesday in
the 50-meter freestyle and, a month from now, they will challenge
the ascendant Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands, who holds world
records in all three of the sprints.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Thompson, who is 27, and Torres, who is 33,
represent the multitudinous possibility for women in this age of
Olympic professionalism and gender equity fostered by Title IX.
Once, female swimmers had to retire in high school, with no college
scholarships or money-making opportunities available to them. Now,
they can keep their careers buoyant on prize money and
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, in particular, is a species as rare as a snail darter _
the female athlete still competing among the world's best as she
nears her mid-'30s. She returned to swimming last year after a
seven-year retirement in which she worked as a fashion model and
television personality. She is talented and effervescent and has
overcome a battle with bulimia. Apparently, no swimmer has ever
taken such a long sabbatical, then seriously challenged for an
Olympic medal. She will be the first American swimmer ever to
compete in four Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   But no Olympic sport has been compromised by the use of
performance-enhancing drugs as women's swimming has been, and the
singular aspect of Torres' career that makes it celebratory also
has led to skepticism about her performances that even her coach
acknowledges have clouded any accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Torres has never failed a drug test, and no other swimmer or
coach here has accused her of take banned, performance-enhancing
substances. But after three decades of demonstrated cheating in
this sport involving East German and Chinese athletes, the 1996
Irish Olympic champion Michelle Smith and even American athletes, a
despairing ritual has become the habit in swimming and almost every
other Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Though testing is conducted at all major meets, no tests have
been approved for substances that athletes are believed to be
widely using such as EPO and human growth hormone. Cheaters have
become sophisticated by using synthetic versions of substances that
exist naturally in the body and are difficult to detect. An EPO
test may be implemented at the Sydney Games, but the International
Olympic Committee's own doctors are saying privately that they fear
the tests will not withstand legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, coaches and athletes concede, passing a drug test
no longer provides convincing evidence of being drug-free. In such
a climate of uncertainty, every remarkable performance becomes
suspicious, and news conferences have become tense give-and-takes
involving skepticism and denial.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, the coach of the American women's Olympic swim
team, said in an interview that he understood the distrust. He was
among the loudest in his skepticism about the Chinese, who have had
some three dozen swimmers test positive in the 1990s, and Smith,
who was banned last year after having contaminated one of her drug
tests with alcohol and having previously tested positive for
androstenedione. He said he blamed the IOC for betraying athletes
who do not take drugs, because, given the current testing
deficiencies, the innocent can no longer prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that sport is at the point where every great
performance has a cloud over it,'' said Quick, who coaches both
Thompson and Torres in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm bitter toward the IOC. They've allowed cheating
to go on far too long. They are a lot more into sponsorship money
and television money. They are a lot more concerned about many
things other than the rights of fair competition for athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   His athletes are clean, Quick said. Torres is at the cutting
edge of nutrition, strength and flexibility training, he said, and
she works out ravenously. And, he pointed out, she did not come
from nowhere. Before she retired after the 1992 Summer Games,
Torres won two Olympic gold medals on relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's a huge miracle that I'm swimming
faster,'' Torres said. ``This is what I think was in me when I was
younger. The circumstances weren't right. I had an eating problem.
Training is better for me. Nutrition is better for me. Everything
is in a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a supporter in what may seem to an unexpected place.
Phil Whitten, the editor of Swimming World magazine, has been at
the forefront of revealing widespread drug use in swimming. His
magazine first published reports from the files of the East German
police, known as the Stasi, that uncovered the state-sponsored
system of cheating in the sport. But he said he was not suspicious
about Torres, given her history of swimming fast, and the new
training techniques being used.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, while teaching anthropology at Harvard, Whitten said he
conducted research on masters swimmers, tracing several thousand
athletes over a 20-year period and showing that swimmers reached
their peaks at 32 or 33. Until recently, however, elite athletes
did not have the financial support to remain in the Olympic side of
the sport that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '93 and '94, I was banging my head against the wall, trying
to get the major media to realize there was a widespread drug
problem in the sport,'' Whitten said. ``Now that they've realized
it, they've overlearned the lesson. They can't distinguish between
people whose performances are suspicious and people whose
performances are legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Thompson and Torres here has focused on
their own relationship, which appears respectful if not cordial.
Thompson is from New Hampshire, a taciturn Yankee, though she has
drawn much attention, and some criticism, for posing without a top
on in the current issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. (She said
she posed so that girls could see that it was okay to have a
muscular appearance.) Torres is from Beverly Hills, sunny and
gregarious. They train at different times, Torres saying that
workouts became too intense together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two great athletes desired a lot of individual attention and
somewhat demanded it,'' Quick said.

SENSIBLE CRAB LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week the federal government took long overdue action to
protect the horseshoe crab from commercial devastation, while still
making the animals available for critical medical uses. Until last
week, the government had it backwards, trying to keep a Cape Cod
company from bleeding some horseshoe crabs for a substance used in
medical equipment sterilization, but allowing mid-Atlantic
fishermen to slaughter hundreds of thousands of them for bait.
</P>
<P>
   The government action establishes an 1,800-square-mile sanctuary
for horseshoe crabs from Delaware Bay out into the Atlantic, and it
directs worst-offender Virginia to drastically reduce its catch
voluntarily or risk being shut down by government order. Fishermen
use horseshoe crabs as bait for eels and a form of conch, the
channeled whelk, that is a mainstay of Cantonese cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The government's actions are needed to protect the horseshoe
crabs, a quickly dwindling species that predates dinosaurs and is
actually closer to spiders than it is to ordinary crabs. Horseshoe
crabs are critical not only to an industry that produces Limulus
Amebocyte Lysate from their blood for the detection of bacterial
contamination, but also to several species of shore birds that use
excess horseshoe crab eggs as a fast-food stop on their migration
flights.
</P>
<P>
   While mid-Atlantic breeding grounds for the crabs have suffered
from lax oversight, regulators have erred in the opposite direction
in New England. The US Interior Department has tried to stop a
lysate company based in Falmouth from bleeding any of the horseshoe
crabs off the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Monomoy National
Wildlife Refuge, even though a study in the 1980s showed that the
process kills few if any of the animals. This spring, a federal
judge had the good sense to issue an injunction to lift Interior's
ban for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The real battle to ensure the long-term survival of the
horseshoe crab will be fought in the mid-Atlantic states. It is
gratifying to see that the federal government understands the
stakes.

DEMONSTRATORS SEEK TO RECLAIM LOST VOICE IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Face pressed against the chainlink fence
encircling the protest pit, Jonah Zern shouted, pleaded, to be
taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, speaker after speaker took to the microphone.
Several thousand demonstrators roared their approval. But Zern, a
22-year-old recent college graduate, worried that no one who wasn't
nearby would hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're protesting to protest,'' said Zern, whose T-shirt
advertised a group called Students Alliance to Reform Corporations.
``We have to protest. To be heard in the United States, you have to
have wealth. For the average person, you have to find another
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, from Patriotic Hall where the second Shadow Convention is
being held to the Convergence Center where puppets and other props
are built to Pershing Square where protesters rally before marching
the dozen blocks to the convention center, the massed opponents of
the status quo wonder whether their messages resonate, not just
with the Democrats gathered in Los Angeles but also with a
citizenry impatient with activism.
</P>
<P>
   There are, after all, dozens of messages vying for attention.
Protest organizers could sew an enormous quilt using just the
slogans on signs, shirts and caps that can be spotted at any
demonstration. Whether the cause is saving the ancient forests,
shuttering sweatshops or ensuring access to health care, it is sure
to be represented somewhere in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But above the din -- once the paraders dressed as Mother Earth
and Uncle Sam and billionaires buying government influence have
passed -- one concern comes through loud and clear: regardless of
specific issue, these demonstrators no longer believe that America
belongs to Americans. It is what unites them, they say, even when
their agendas overlap or conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really boils down to, at least here at the DNC, is
that we don't have a say in politics anymore,'' said Meagan
Cartwright, a 20-year-old college physics major from Seattle who is
interning at a nonprofit organization working to stop global
warming and save the ozone layer. ``That's what brings us all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when poll after poll shows increasing political
apathy, the thousands of demonstrators who paid their own way to
bake in the sun outside the Staples Center understand that they are
an anomaly. With their aggressive slogans and guerrilla stunts,
they have watched themselves dismissed as fringe fanatics or
raucous rioters. Many blame the media for emphasizing another day
of peace over any of the substantive issues under discussion on
stages and street corners around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the demonstrators, in fact, are young, in their teens or
twenties, and not always well-showered. But just as many are in
well-worn T-shirts espousing causes dating back 20 or 30 years.
Union hats bob in the crowds. Ask them, and many demonstrators say
they are just ordinary Americans whose country is at an
extraordinary crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around at the diversity of the crowd,'' said Donald
Kegley, 46, a third-generation steelworker from Eureka, Calif., and
co-chairman of a group called the Alliance for Sustainable Jobs and
the Environment. ``I think what we're all trying to say is that
government caters to corporations and not the needs of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Francisco Argerre, 45, a Mexican immigrant and furniture
mover who lives in Los Angeles, ``Corporations even influence
immigration. That's what worries me most.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Kegley were at a rally Monday to save an indigenous
Colombian tribe called the U'wa, whose lands are allegedly being
destroyed by Occidental Petroleum -- an issue on which protesters
say Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore has declined to take
a stand. ``Al Gore: Reject Big Oil $$'' read the banner under which
speakers addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As Julie Freitas, an Angeleno whose 24-year-old son was murdered
in Colombia last while working to defend the U'wa, told them, ``You
are the ones who can make change. We used to make change, but we're
old and tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside The Gap in downtown Santa Monica, where
hundreds of demonstrators on Sunday demanded an end to what they
claimed are sweatshop conditions at factories around the world used
by the retailer and other clothing companies, environmentalists
dressed as frogs mingled with ``billionaires'' whose top hats and
tails were intended to mock money's influence on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the human rights group Global
Exchange and the Green Party candidate for a US Senate seat from
California, ``It's the kind of thing where people can really make
the connection between these clothes and sweatshop conditions. .
.We need to make people understand that a system based on corporate
greed is not good for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans needs not corporate greed'' was Monday's official
protest theme. Upcoming themes revolve around the criminal justice
system, environmental protections, and worker rights. At the Shadow
Convention, the day's topic was the gap between rich and poor, and
enough people turned out to fill an auditorium almost to capacity.
Tuesday's theme is the failed war on drugs. Wednesday's is campaign
finance reform -- a theme that activists of every stripe raise at
every rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing it the right way, hitting four or five major
themes and laying the groundwork for the future,'' said Allen
Powell, 47, a high school economics teacher who set aside his
social activism after he had a family but was drawn to the Shadow
Convention Monday. ``It's always difficult when you have so much
prosperity to get people to care. But it's important for people to
make these connections because when times aren't so good, they'll
be together.''

ARRESTED POET AN INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION OF FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tendency Quarterly, the literary magazine whose
contents apparently landed the Boston-based poet Bei Ling in a
Chinese prison last weekend, has never managed to come out
quarterly, or to push its circulation over 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the tiny publication brought Bei Ling, who was formally
detained by Beijing police Monday, to the attention of the Chinese
government and won him broad support among free speech advocates
both internationally and in the Chinese intellectual underground.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, stressing that the United States
has not confirmed the jailing of Bei, said Monday that such an
arrest would be ``extremely disturbing'' to the US government. News
of the arrest reached US officials and the media through Bei's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bei Ling to our knowledge has not engaged in any criminal
activity,'' the official said. ``China has committed itself to
uphold the principle of freedom. . . . To detain an individual for
the peaceful expression of political or other views is a violation
of these commitments,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The formal detention allows police to hold Bei for 30 days while
attempting to build a case against him, according to a relative who
relayed the news to the media. The police have made no specific
charge, the relative said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the specific charge is the last thing that matters to the
regime,'' said Ross Terrill, an author of books on modern Chinese
political leaders. Terrill himself was expelled from China in 1992
for allegedly exceeding the activities allowed by a tourist visa.
``They will think of something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei, who visits China annually, ``has had his problems, as we
all have,'' said Terrill, a research associate at Harvard
University's East Asia Center. ``He has been harassed, he has been
pressured, he has suffered mysterious incidents of boxes (of the
journal) disappearing while he was trying to distribute it. But
this is an escalation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei came to the United States from Beijing in 1988, while a
surge in free expression was sweeping through China. He was
participating in a literary exchange program sponsored by a New
York Chinese newspaper when the free speech and democracy movement
came to an abrupt and bloody end the next year, with China's
massacre of demonstrators around Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter, and the long period of repression that followed,
made Bei a determined activist, willing to take the risks involved
in participating in the underground literary world of China.
</P>
<P>
   First he joined protests against the crackdown, and tried to
organize support for the victims. Then he enrolled in ``Freedom to
Write,'' a Brown University program from writers from China, Cuba,
and other countries where repression was common. When that program
ended in 1993, he moved to Boston to be near the humanist and
Chinese cultural centers of Harvard, and because he had friends
here who would help him launch the journal.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 issues of Tendency Quarterly that have appeared since
then have stretched the boundaries of a literary journal to include
dialogues between Chinese and Western intellectuals and interviews
with writers and poets including Nadine Gordimer, Seamus Heaney,
and Susan Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   Gordimer and Sontag became editorial advisers, according to
executive editor Meng Lang, a cofounder of the journal who now
lives in Cambridge, Mass.; so did Nobel laureates Elie Weisel,
Czeslaw Milosz, and Octavio Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Tendency also attracted the attention of the National Endowment
for Democracy, a quasi-independent, US-government funded
organization set up during Ronald Reagan's presidency; the
organization provided financial support in 1995 and 1996, Meng
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meng said that he and Bei have been associates since the 1980s,
and that he followed his friend to the writers program at Brown,
arriving in 1995 after having been harassed and detained himself in
the southern city of Shenzhen.
</P>

GULF COAST UNFAZED BY BERYL'S APPROACH

   HARLINGEN _ Tropical Storm Beryl quickened its pace toward the
Gulf Coast shore Monday, but many residents, mindful of last year's
weak pass by Hurricane Bret, seemed unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they watched Beryl's development, planned to weather
the storm at home and hoped it would mean a needed soaking of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hurricane Bret, a powerful Category 4 storm, barreled
through the open ranch country of South Texas, doing little harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's left yet and nobody is talking about leaving,'' said
Matt Moreau, owner of Pico Ace Hardware on South Padre Island.
``Most people are laughing about it and being cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Weather Service predicted that Beryl's
effect on the Houston area would be limited to widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms ending Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a quarter of an inch (of rain), consider yourself
lucky,'' said weather service meteorologist Kent Prochazka.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl was declared a tropical storm Monday when its sustained
winds reached 40 mph. It could reach hurricane strength _
consistent winds of at least 75 mph _ before blowing ashore Tuesday
somewhere near the U.S.-Mexico border, said James Franklin at the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl was centered about 135 miles south-southwest of
Brownsville and was moving northwest at 8 mph. Meteorologists said
if it continued at that pace, it might not have time to grow into a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. government issued a hurricane warning for a
100-mile stretch from Baffin Bay, just north of Corpus Christi, to
the Mexican border. The Mexican government issued a hurricane
warning from the border south to La Pesca, a stretch of about 130
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, few South Padre Island residents purchased
plywood sheets and flashlight batteries. People were confident the
storm would follow weather service predictions and hit land south
of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm passes to the south, residents of the Rio Grande
Valley would see strong winds and get a much-needed drenching of 5
inches to 10 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not boarding up windows or advising evacuation, and
we're not planning to do that,'' said Ray Kendall, South Padre
Island city manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through our countdown: closing off the low access
points to the beach so the water won't flood the streets; moving
trash barrels back to vegetation line; trying to get people to move
their umbrellas off the beach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County's two beachfront parks on South Padre Island were
closed Monday as crews boarded up facilities facing the Gulf. An
evacuation of mobile homes at Isla Blanca Park also was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a steady stream of shrimp trawlers moved through the
Brazos Santiago Pass on their way to Port Isabel, cutting short
fishing trips into the roiling Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
   At the island's U.S. Coast Guard station, three rescue boats
were hauled out of the water and a 41-foot patrol boat was moved
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Mike Watson said the station was preparing for an
intense tropical storm _ with a storm surge and high winds _ but
not a major hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, everything is calm,'' Watson said. The turmoil at sea
was good news for some: Near the island's southern jetties, eager
surfers lined the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay out there 'til I get washed back in,'' said
Houston surfer Aaron Lloyd, watching the waves hiss to shore. ``We
always come down here for the hurricanes _ it's the only good surf
all summer.''

DEAD CROWS TRACK SPREAD OF NILE VIRUS IN EASTERN MASS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ State officals identified six more crows infected with
the West Nile virus Monday, doubling the number of bird cases to
date and suggesting the virus is spreading more quickly in August
as the mosquito population swells.
</P>
<P>
   The virus hot spot is now clearly the Jamaica Plain-Brookline
area, where all six infected birds were found, said state
officials. However, they said Monday's finds were expected and
likely will be repeated again this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting to have positive birds each week, not only in
JP-Brookline, but scattered in other areas,'' said Ralph Timperi,
director of the state public health lab in Jamaica Plain. ``I'm
sure we'll find (infected) birds until the first week of October,
when the frost puts the mosquitoes down.''
</P>
<P>
   The news followed a weekend of events that affirmed the virus
has found a home on the East Coast: Rhode Island's first infected
crow and two more non-fatal human cases in New York. The
potentially lethal virus has now surfaced in every state between
New Jersey and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, East Coast health officals already have begun turning
their attention to next summer, when the cases of the virus could
multiply _ especially in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquitoes born in mid-August will probably be the ones to
carry the virus into next year. Crews are blanketing greater Boston
neighborhoods, laying tablets in breeding areas they hope will kill
these new arrivals before they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Migrating birds are thought to carry the virus from state to
state, but mosquitoes spread it locally. Paul Jacobsen, the deputy
commissioner of the state Department of Public Health, said that
the leafy area where Jamaica Plain meets Brookline ``appears to be
the center of West Nile activity in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, 10 of the 12 infected Massachusetts birds have been
found there. One of the crows identified Monday was actually found
in Wellesley but officials said the bird probably strayed. A
secondary hot spot is thought to be in the Hopkinton area, where
two birds have been found.
</P>
<P>
   All six birds found Monday died between Aug. 7 and 9 in the
heaviest virus toll to date. That mirrors the experience elsewhere:
New York has seen a jump in bird and mosquito cases in recent
weeks, and the virus was most deadly in August 1999, when it killed
seven and sickened about 60 in Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's crow body count coincides with a dramatic increase in
the Culex pipiens mosquito, which carries the virus. Since
mid-July, its population has increased tenfold every two weeks. It
peaks this week.
</P>
<P>
   The state lab has tested more than 500 dead birds this summer,
and 35 new ones came in this weekend. The testing can take up to
three days.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the mosquitoes that have been hatching since Aug. 10
that are likely to survive the frost and the winter. Next summer,
they may continue to spread the virus here, perhaps at an
accelerated pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems likely that there will be more cases next year,''
said Andrew Spielman, a professor of tropical public health at
Harvard's School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the turning point for this summer's mosquitoes is
already at hand. Aug. 10 is when long summer days begin to contain
less than 14 hours and 15 minutes of sunlight. This is a
physiological trigger for the mosquitoes about to hatch, telling
their bodies to concentrate on food storage instead of
reproduction. They feed for a few weeks in August but their
newly-instructed bodies can draw from the food supply for months,
allowing them to survive winter. The older mosquitoes, fatigued by
reproduction, will probably not make it.
</P>
<P>
   These new mosquitoes, if infected, will start the disease cycle
again next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect (the virus) will appear in areas as far as 200 miles
from here,'' said Spielman.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the virus made its first appearance in Rhode
Island, killing a crow found in Warwick. The state had been
practicing all summer for the possibility and greeted the finding
calmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's positive indication of West Nile virus in Warwick is
not unexpected, with positive results already turning up to our
south in Connecticut and to our north in Massachusetts,'' said
Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no human cases this summer anywhere but Staten
Island, N.Y., which appears to be the virus' epicenter. This past
weekend, officials there revealed that a 63-year-old woman and a
64-year-old man tested postive for it, bringing the total of West
Nile victims to three. All have recovered, they said. The virus
produced a mild form of meningitis in all three, a dramatic
contrast to the rapid brain-swelling encephalitis that killed
Queens residents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority of cases, West Nile virus causes mild flu-like
symptoms. It can occasionally be fatal. The elderly, infants, and
those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the last symbolic act of his failed
presidential campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley released his 390
delegates to Vice President Al Gore on Monday, telling them that
``Al Gore will stand for the things we fought for in this campaign
and he deserves our support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in spotlight for the first time in months and flanked by
his wife and daughter, Bradley delivered a speech that echoed his
stump appearances of the winter, praising the ``goodness of the
American people'' and hailing the importance of universal health
care, campaign finance reform and programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Then, recalling an event last month where he formally endorsed
Gore, he encouraged his supporters to set aside their hard feelings
about the bitterly contested primaries and work hard for the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is a team sport,'' Bradley said. ``We have to win in
the fall. The stakes are large. The Supreme Court. Social Security
at a cross roads. And what happens when the budget surplus is up
for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Bradley's brief remarks, William Daley, Gore's
campaign chairman, praised the former senator as ``a special
person'' who had a ``special understanding of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To honor him is to make sure that the sort of things he wanted
come into being,'' Daley said. ``For that, we need your strong
support for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley noted that Bradley often took ``controversial positions''
that ``may have caused him problems in the short term, but in the
long term were right.'' Paradoxically, Gore harshly attacked
Bradley throughout the campaign for taking positions that did not
conform to Democratic Party orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is to make a 15-minute address to the convention Tuesday
night in prime time. His speech, his aides said, would be unlike
the poorly received keynote address he made to the convention in
1992 when he angrily accused President George Bush of ``not getting
it'' and complained that ``For too long, American leadership has
waffled and wiggled and wavered.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his aides said, Bradley will call for ``a new kind of
politics'' that is more upbeat and optimistic. But they said he
would not shy away from criticizing the Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley spoke fondly on Monday of the 15-month campaign
that he called ``a joyous journey,'' it is difficult to say what
mark he left on the party or its standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself contends that he pushed Gore into taking
stronger positions on expanding health care, gun control, child
poverty and campaign finance reform. And many of Gore's aides
acknowledge that Bradley's challenge _ which early on seemed
formidable but melted quickly _ made Gore a better campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though he amassed a warchest of more than $20 million
and assembled a sprawling if poorly organized band of followers in
most major states, Bradley failed to win a single primary or
caucus, and had no apparent input on the writing of the Democratic
platform.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said Bradley has not decided what he will do next.
They said he was likely to follow a path similar to before the
campaign, writing a book, working as a consultant and possibly
teaching on the side.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Bradley entered the room, he was enveloped by supporters,
and as he left, he worked his way slowly to the rear of the room
shaking hands and signing autographs to all comers. But as he often
did on the stump, Bradley looked somewhat uncomfortable in the
spotlight, tightly gripping his microphone in both hands and
looking stone-faced into the crowd when they interrupted him with
applause, which was often.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the delegates in the crowd said they were prepared to
work enthusiastically for Gore, if only out of fears that voting
for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, or not voting at all,
would lead to a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want Gore to lose,'' said David Loebsack, a
professor of political science at Cornell College in Iowa and a
Bradley delegate. ``There is a real difference between Gore and the
Republican ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in the room agreed. Cornel West, a Harvard
professor who is close to Bradley, said there was still deep
wariness among some Bradley supporters toward Gore and his more
centrist agenda. ``Bradley still hasn't had his due,'' West said.
``It's clear we still don't have two clear choices in this race.''

RUSSIANS SEEK WAY TO RESCUE TRAPPED SUB CREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's navy struggled to find a way Monday to rescue
more than 100 crew members trapped on a crippled Russian nuclear
submarine stranded on the bottom of icy seas north of the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, a massive Oscar-II class submarine designed to
destroy aircraft carrier groups such as those deployed by the US
Navy, plunged to the ocean floor of the Barents Sea early Sunday
after the crew was forced to shut down its two nuclear reactors
during a magor naval exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Kursk, which is capable of carrying 24
nuclear-tipped ship-killing missiles, had no nuclear weapons on
board at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials disclosed the accident only Monday, as rescue
ships rushed to the area where the distressed vessel lay, about 500
feet down in international waters, just north of the Kola
Peninsula. But officials here gave conflicting assessments of the
accident's cause and their chances for recovering the craft and
saving the crew.
</P>
<P>
   As rescuers in miniature submarines circled the stricken vessel,
the commander of Russia's navy, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, said
the Kursk apparently had been involved in a major collision and
sustained serious damage, and expressed grave doubts that the 116
officers and sailors on board could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' Russian news agencies quoted Kuroyedov as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted a defence company
source later Monday as saying preliminary surveys of the Kursk
ruled out a collision as a cause of the disaster, and instead
suggested that an explosion had occured in one of the forward
sections, where the submarine's torpedos are kept.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said the rescuers had not abandoned their
efforts to save the crew. A nuclear submarine normally generates
oxygen and electric power with is reactors, and they have been
turned off since early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian state television reported that the navy would make a
decision on how to try to rescue the crew early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is serious, but according to the command of the
Northern Fleet its rescue teams have enough resources to deal with
the issue without turning to others for help,'' Tass quoted the
fleet's command as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain
submerged before it ran out of air for the crew. But Russian naval
command said rescue teams were busy fixing a special rescue diving
bell to the body of Kursk that would help restore the power and the
air supply to the submarine. The gear also can be used to help the
crew escape through rescue hatches.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials also declined to report the depth of the
vessel, though a Norwegian report said the Kursk was submerged in
480 feet of water. This would make it difficult to rescue the crew
by letting them out and allowing them to float up to the surface
because of the enormous water pressure at that depth, although
submarine crews have been known to train for undersea escapes at
even lower depths.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the accident were sketchy and at times contradictory.
As they first disclosed the accident early Monday, Navy officials
emphasized that the submarine was not carrying any nuclear weapons,
had no radiation leaks, and that the crew of the Kursk was in no
immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day went on and Russian rescue ships rushed to the
area, the focus of concern shifted to the dire situation of men on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters quoted a Russian news agency as saying that some of the
crew already may have died, though this report was not confirmed by
the military. Other speculation focused on the cause of the
accident _ NTV television reported that the Kursk may have collided
with a foreign submarine shadowing the Russian exercises. Western
and US submarines commonly monitor Russian naval manuvers, leading
to some close calls and even scrapes at sea. In 1993 a Russian and
an American sub collided in the Barents, but both vessels were able
to return to base.
</P>
<P>
   A US Navy spokeswoman said in Washington that US Naval Ship
Loyal, which gathers underwater acoustical data, was about 250
miles away from the Russian submarine when it went down. The ship
was there by coincidence and had nothing to do with the Russian
submarine or subsequent rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Rear Admiral Craig Quigley said the
US military has not been asked to assist in the rescue. Other
military officials said that although the US Navy has submarine
rescue vessels, their hatches are compatible only with US-made
submarines and could not be used in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday the Russian navy said it had two submarines
investigating the hull of the stricken vessel for possible signs of
damage. Privately owned NTV television reported that rescuers were
also communicating with the crew by sending coded messages by
banging on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1995, the Kursk is one of Russia's most modern
submarines and served as the prototype for a Russian sub portrayed
in a 1997 Hollywood action flick, ``Delta Force 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine's main weapons, 24 supersonic SS-N-19 missiles,
are designed to be fired in a salvo at enemy aircraft carrier
groups. Each of the missiles, called Shipwreck by NATO, weighs
seven tons and has a firing range of more than 310 miles. Russian
military officials say the salvo fired from an Oscar-2 is
impossible to evade or shoot down.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Kursk became a sad symbol of the poor
financing and dilapidated state of the once mighty Northern Fleet,
when its captain, Gennady Lyachin, 45, and officers accepted a
shipment of food aid from the governor of Kursk region in southern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Home to the huge Russian Northern Fleet, which at its height in
the 1980s had about 150 nuclear submarines, the Kola Peninsula for
decades was a certain target for a massive Western strike in the
event of nuclear war. In recent years, the area has become the site
of mishaps involving the aging fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 a Soviet nuclear submarine sank off north Norway,
killing 42 of the 69-man crew. The Komsomolets submarine, the
prototype of the Mike-class sub, now lies rusting, along with its
nuclear torpedoes, on the sea bed of the Barents.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998 a Delta-class nuclear submarine, armed with 12
ballistic missiles, suffered what Western defense and environmental
agencies described as a serious accident involving a fire on board,
causing a brief panic in the Kola Peninsula port of Murmansk.
Russian officials denied an incident took place.
</P>
<P>
   The following September a sailor killed eight of his fellow
crewmates and briefly hijacked a nuclear-powered attack sub. The
sailor, Alexander Kuzminikh, an 18-year-old draftee from St.
Petersburg, threatened to blow up the ship's nuclear-tipped
torpedoes. The drama ended when he took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have tried to crack down on environmental agencies
trying to disclose the dangers posed by the fleet. Alexander
Nikitin, a former submarine captain, was charged with treason after
he co-authored a report by the Norwegian environmental agency
Bellona report on hazards caused by the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin won a battle in court when a judge found him not guilty,
but only after he spent two years in prison.

 CRITICS ASK FIRESTONE TO TRIPLE RECALL OF TIRES FOR SUVS  (Editors:
Also see TIRE-PLANT) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plaintiffs' lawyers and safety advocates called
Monday on Firestone to triple the scope of its recall of tires for
sport utility vehicles. They contend that the tire maker and the
Ford Motor Co. were misleading the public about the safety of many
Firestone tires and of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles
equipped with them.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' statements highlighted an escalating squabble over
how to apportion the limited numbers of replacement tires
available. Ford and Firestone, a unit of Japan's Bridgestone Corp.,
have tried to conduct the recall in stages, giving top priority to
people in hot-weather states where Firestone's data indicates that
its tires are most likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   But in a press conference here Monday, the lawyers and safety
advocates urged consumers in all states to immediately replace all
Firestone Wilderness AT tires on Ford Explorers, including many
tires that have not been recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the attorney general of South Carolina, Charlie
Condon, sued Bridgestone Monday, contending that his state should
be among the first to receive replacement tires, instead of being
in the recall's third and final tier.
</P>
<P>
   Tire dealers and Ford dealerships across the country have been
swamped since last week's recall announcement with people angrily
demanding replacement tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone are trying to steer the first batches to
Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, where 85 percent of the
incidents of tire failure have occurred. They want to send the next
batches to Oklahoma, Nevada, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and
Mississippi, which have accounted for another 4 percent of the
incidents. According to Ford and Firestone, there have been very
few incidents elsewhere, including virtually none in New York, New
Jersey or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman, said that calls for a wider recall
ran counter to the longstanding policy of regulators and automakers
to give priority to motorists most at risk of injury. He criticized
the plaintiffs' lawyers and safety advocates for urging people
nationwide to seek immediate replacements of their tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is precisely the opposite, which is to
try to get people to replace bad tires,'' Zino said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Baughman, a senior Ford engineer, said that Ford had been
having more luck than expected in lining up alternative sources of
tires. But replacement tires will remain scarce until at least
early September, he said. Chris Karbowiak, a Firestone spokeswoman,
said that the company hoped to replace all the recalled tires
before next summer, a little faster than the one-year target set
last week.
</P>
<P>
   At their news conference Monday, the tire critics discounted
assertions _ some by Ford, some by Firestone and some by both
companies _ that problems with the tires resulted from poor
manufacturing practices, hot weather, overloaded vehicles or
inadequate tire maintenance by motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lawyers and safety advocates accused Ford of doing
a poor job of designing the Ford Explorer's suspension and setting
technical specifications for the tires. The combination, they said,
made the tires more likely to come apart at high speeds and the
vehicles more likely to roll over as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a design defect,'' said Joan Claybrook, a former
vehicle safety regulator who is now the president of Public
Citizen, a safety advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Ford strongly denied that there was anything wrong with the
Explorer or the tire specifications. ``We've built Explorers with
brands of tires other than Firestones and had absolutely no
problems,'' Baughman said, blaming poor tire quality as the source
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone tires not covered by the recall have ``world-class''
safety records, he added, arguing that replacing them with other
brands, as the critics proposed, would not improve motorists'
safety.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ford released an analysis of Firestone data showing
that very high claims rates for injuries and property damage had
been confined to the tires being recalled: 15-inch ATX and ATX II
tires of the P235/75R15 size produced at various Firestone
factories, and Wilderness AT tires of the same size manufactured at
Firestone's factory in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and Public Citizen criticized Ford for not releasing
warranty claims information too, and said that all 15- and 16-inch
Wilderness AT tires should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   C. Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who has a number
of lawsuits filed against both companies, said that he and his
allies were not calling for a wider recall so as to strengthen
their chances in court. Ford has already replaced 16-inch
Wilderness tires in hot-weather countries like Saudi Arabia, a fact
he said could be used against the company in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone estimates that it has made 48 million ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness AT tires. Last Wednesday's recall covered 14 million of
these tires, but the company estimates that only 6.5 million of
them are still in use, because the ATX and ATX II tires have not
been made since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most of the 34 million tires that the lawyers want
added to the recall are likely to be still on the road because they
are all Wilderness tires, a brand only made since 1996, when it
replaced the ATX and ATX II brands.

COMPANIES THROUGH WEIGHT BEHIND LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Hoping to vault the Linux operating software
into the desktop market, a group of key companies are expected to
make a series of announcements Tuesday aimed at boosting Linux's
chance of becoming a viable alternative to Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM are
among the heavyweights to throw their support behind a new Linux
organization called the Gnome Foundation, whose goal is to spread
the adoption of Linux by creating a comprehensive suite of software
applications to lure consumers away from Microsoft's ubiquitous
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are set to make their pledges at LinuxWorld, a
gathering of Linux software developers in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual nonentity several years ago, the Linux operating
system has taken the computing world by storm. Because the source
code for Linux is freely available to anyone, it has attracted a
fanatical following among software developers. And because many
versions of Linux are free, it has also amassed a notable share of
the market. Last year, Linux commanded 24 percent of new US sales
of operating systems for server computers, compared with
Microsoft's 38 percent, according to IDC, a technology research
firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Linux is hardly a household brand, particularly within
the world of desktops, where it had just 4 percent of new sales
last year. Microsoft, by contrast, commanded 87 percent of that
market.
</P>
<P>
   One major reason why Linux hasn't caught on with consumers is
that it is relatively difficult to use. Gnome (pronounced guh-nome)
is setting out to solve that by promoting a single graphical user
interface developed by Helixcode in Cambridge, Mass. The interface
is supposed to make Linux as easy and intuitive to use as Windows
or or Apple Computer's Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is also set up to attack another problem _ the
scarcity of software applications that can run on Linux. In a coup
for the fledgling foundation, Sun Microsystems is expected to
announce that its StarOffice software package will be integrated
with Helixcode's Gnome user interface, said Miguel de Icaza,
Helixcode's chief technology officer. StarOffice rivals Microsoft's
Office products.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, Sun will incorporate Gnome on its
popular Solaris machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer market, Linux is expected to gain further
momentum from IBM, which is set to announce a line of ThinkPad
laptop computers that will run a Gnome version of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   While Linux continues to attract powerful allies, including Dell
Computer Corp., whose chief executive Michael Dell is scheduled to
deliver the keynote address at LinuxWorld, it remains unclear
whether Linux will ever unseat Microsoft's Windows as the premier
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Linux to be successful, a lot of people have to buy into
it,'' said Al Gillen, research manager at IDC. ``It's not a
no-brainer that this will all fall into place. There's still a lot
of work ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillen estimates that sales of the Linux operating system will
grow by more than 20 percent a year for the next five years, the
same growth rate he projects for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a surge in Linux shipments,'' Gillen said, ``but
we do not expect Linux to overtake Microsoft anytime soon.''

DE BEERS AGREES TO PAY HIGHER PRICE FOR CANADIAN DIAMOND COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African giant
of the global diamond industry, won control of a promising diamond
company in Canada Monday, agreeing to its demands for a higher
price after a seven-week takeover struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The De Beers purchase of Winspear Diamonds Inc. of Vancouver is
the first diamond property the company has bought in Canada. It
reflects the company's effort to broaden its sources of supply away
from the war zones of Africa. Winspear owns a potentially lucrative
underwater diamond deposit at Snap Lake in the Northwest
Territories.
</P>
<P>
   Winspear directors endorsed the sweetened De Beers offer of 5
Canadian dollars a share, or 305 million Canadian dollars ($205
million). Winspear's president and chief executive, Randy Turner,
said the bid ``recognizes the value and potential of the Snap Lake
diamond deposit.''
</P>
<P>
   Winspear's shares rose 18 percent to 4.93 Canadian dollars
($3.32) on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the agreement was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers' first offer of 4.25 Canadian dollars a share, on June
26, was dismissed as hostile by Winspear management. The Canadian
company also said its Snap Lake ore reserves were triple what had
been claimed _ and worth at least 500 million Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Richard Molyneaux, president of De Beers Canada
Inc., noted that no reserve had actually been defined on the Snap
Lake property, which is about 140 miles northeast of Yellowknife,
and that reaching under the lake bed to mine the shallow deposit
would be risky. But 10 days later, De Beers extended the expiration
date on its bid and Winspear dropped two legal actions, opening the
way to friendlier talks.
</P>
<P>
   Snap Lake would be the first underground diamond mine in Canada.
Since De Beers has unmatched experience in this area, and some
urgency about expanding in Canada, there was some expectation that
it would eventually buy Winspear.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers was a bystander in the late 1990s, when the first
diamond mines were discovered in Canada, but it has become more
active since Molyneaux, who has mine experience in South Africa,
became head of the Canadian subsidiary early this year. The company
now markets 35 percent of production from the Ekati mine, also in
the Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers will inherit a legal battle with a minority partner in
the Snap Lake property. Aber Resources, also of Vancouver, had 33
percent of the claim but, after it did not maintain its share of
expenses, Winspear said that Aber's interest had been reduced to 15
percent. Aber disputed the claim, which is now in the courts.

BUSH TO PARDON INMATE BASED ON NEW DNA TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush announced Monday he would pardon a
Texas inmate convicted a decade ago of rape, after new DNA evidence
convinced even prosecutors and law enforcement officials that the
man should be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will sign the pardon of the inmate, Roy Criner, on Tuesday,
clearing the way for his release after serving 10 years of a
99-year sentence for the rape of a 16-year-old in Montgomery
County, north of Houston. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles,
which rarely approves pardons, Monday voted 18-0 in favor of
pardoning Criner, 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the Board of Pardons and Paroles that credible
new evidence raises substantial doubt about the guilt of Roy
Criner, and that he should receive a pardon,'' Bush said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also announced he would pardon a second inmate,
Ronnie Mark Gariepy, 41, who is on parole after being convicted of
sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. Local officials endorsed the
pardon after Gariepy's stepdaughter, who was 13 at the time she
said she was attacked, recanted her story. The two pardons come a
week after Bush approved the execution of Oliver Cruz, a convicted
rapist and murderer deemed mentally retarded by defense
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   The Criner case focused national criticism on the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court. In 1998, the
court disregarded DNA evidence that proved that semen found in the
victim did not belong to Criner. Writing for the majority, Justice
Sharon Keller wrote that the DNA evidence did not cast enough doubt
on the case to merit a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Keller wrote that the victim might have had sex with another
person ``at a time relatively near her death'' and that Criner
either may have failed to ejaculate or have worn a condom.
</P>
<P>
   This year, DNA tests were conducted on a cigarette butt from the
crime scene. The tests found that DNA on the cigarette matched the
DNA of the semen found in the victim. This convinced prosecutors
that someone besides Criner was responsible for the attack.

MARYLAND FIRM TO BUY CERULEAN TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cerulean Technology Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. company that
makes wireless systems for police and other emergency workers, has
agreed to be acquired by Aether Systems Inc. of Maryland for $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   As a unit of Aether, a wireless data products company, Cerulean
will continue to pursue the ``mobile government'' market. It offers
wireless software for laptops and palm computers for police cars
and 911 services, among other users.
</P>
<P>
   The sale gives privately held Cerulean an alternative to a
public stock offering to finance its growth plans. The company has
received $20 million in venture financing since 1995, from firms
including Atlas, Commonwealth Capital, OneLiberty Ventures, and MF
Private Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Cerulean chief executive Bob Badavas called the deal a ``leap
forward'' for the company. He said the mobile government concept
continues to gain ground, noting, ``When I look at growing the
business, first and foremost is access to capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As hot as the wireless sector is, Cerulean fetched a modest
price relative to some of the billion-dollar deals being struck
recently in the communications realm. Analysts said that's because
the government customer base _ despite providing millions in steady
revenues _ isn't as sexy on Wall Street as private-sector revenue
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Aether, by contrast, has a red-hot stock and a $5.4 billion
market value. The Owings Mills, Md., company went public in October
and has seen its shares soar 791 percent. Its shares fell $6.9375
Monday on the buyout news, to $142.50.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan McCallum, general partner with OneLiberty in Cambridge,
Mass., said the venture firm made five times its investment on the
deal. That's not a knockout by Internet standards, but McCallum
says he likes the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination can be one of the winners in wireless data
applications,'' McCallum said. ``I like the idea of Aether stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Aether's strength is in wireless hosting and consulting
services, analysts said. Its software is being used at the
Democratic convention in Los Angeles this week, to put convention
information and news on palm computers. The company reported $16.2
million of revenue for the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cerulean offers products such as in-vehicle mapping, to help law
enforcement officers quickly arrive at emergency calls. Its
products also lets police tap records remotely. The company has 130
employees and plans to add more in the coming months, Badavas said.

AGILENT TO SHED 450 FULL-TIME WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agilent Technologies Inc., facing slower sales of its patient
monitoring, ultrasound and cardiology equipment, is firing 450
full-time employees, including 150 in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the Medical Products and Instrument Group of
Hewlett-Packard, the Palo Alto, Calif. company was spun out as a
separate company with an initial public offering last November.
Since then, sales of Agilent's health care products have been soft
as U.S. hospitals, which account for 60 percent of the company's
revenue, have curtailed spending.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide layoff announcement Monday comes just days before
Agilent is scheduled to release its third fiscal quarter results on
Thursday. The move affects about one percent of its staff of 42,000
but nine percent of full-time employees of its Healthcare Solutions
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 450 full-time employees, the company said it will
terminate 200 of its 350 contract workers. Agilent said it will
take a $25 million one-time charge in its fiscal fourth-quarter to
cover expenses related to the firings.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where the Healthcare Solution Group is based,
the dismissal of 150 employees will leave the Andover operation
with 2,050 employees. Seventy contract workers will also lose their
jobs here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layoffs were across the board in research and development,
marketing, sales, service, manufacturing and administration,'' said
Stephen Rusckowski, senior vice president and general manager of
Agilent's Healthcare Solutions Group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the severance plan, each full-time employee will receive
half of one month's pay for each year worked at both
Hewlett-Packard and Agilent. Employees who agree to leave quickly _
within 10 days of receiving formal notification _ will receive an
additional two month's base pay provided they sign a waiver
agreeing not to bring suit against Agilent.
</P>
<P>
   All employees being dismissed will be notified by 5 p.m.
Tuesday, said Agilent spokeswoman Heidi Wilson. She stressed they
are losing their jobs because of overlapping functions and not for
work performance-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   She noted the U.S. layoffs are expected to be completed by Oct.
31, although the dismissals will take longer in Germany because of
stiffer worker protection laws. The company said the cuts in
Andover, Boblingen, Germany and Qindao, China, will streamline
company operations and save about $80 million a year starting in
fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rusckowsky said there was one hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., there are some signals that health care
reimbursement through Medicare might improve, such as an increase
in some reimbursement payments. And when that happens, our
customers, the hospitals, have said that will help them in their
purchasing efforts,'' said Rusckowski.

RESCUE MAY BE POSSIBLE, RETIRED US SUB CAPTAIN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the crew of the crippled Russian submarine can maintain
enough oxygen to survive for a few days, rescue vehicles from the
United States or other nations may be capable of saving them from
their deep inprisonment, a retired US Navy submarine captain said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said Washington had offered to help with the
rescue, but had yet to receive a request from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy's device for rescuing the crew of a disabled
submarine, called the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle, or DSRV, has
never been used in a real emergency, but is designed to deal with
just such an emergency as this, said retired US Navy Captain
William Gaines of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian sub may have an escape pod of its own that could
be sent to the surface, said Robert Brown, an engineer at the Woods
Hole (Mass.) Oceanographic Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all submarines in the world are equipped with escape
hatches that are designed to fit the DSRV's fittings, Gaines said.
Though he was not familiar with the details of this specific
submarine, he said, ``It's very hard to believe that there's any
submarine force in the business that wouldn't make their hatch
cowling compatible'' with the rescue craft.
</P>
<P>
   And if so, he said, ``a rescue at 450 feet is doable. That's not
very deep.'' Russian officials declined to report the depth of the
sub, but reports out of Norway say it is at 480 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue craft and support equipment are designed and its crew
are trained to deploy anywhere in the world within a few days, he
said. It can hold about 10 people at a time and can make multiple
trips with brief stops to recharge its batteries.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the sub is resting on the sea floor at an extreme
angle, it might not be possible to attach the craft, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is at least one other possible rescue method: using an
old-fashioned rescue bell, a system that was used to rescue 33 of
59 crewmembers from the US submarine Squalus, which sank off
Portsmouth, N.H., in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Although some reports have speculated that the crew might be
able to swim or float to the surface by escaping through an hatch
or even through the torpedo tubes, Gaines said, this was highly
unlikely to work at such a depth.
</P>
<P>
   In a so-called free ascent, a person would simply take a big
breath then gradually let the air out during the ascent. Because
the pressure is getting lower as the diver ascends, air expands
quickly and could explode the person's lungs. Such escapes are part
of every submariner's training, Gaines said.
</P>
<P>
   That system might work from a lesser depth, Gaines said, but
ascending from nearly 500 feet would take at least four minutes,
and ``there aren't many people who can hold their breath for four
minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the extreme cold of the water in the Barents Sea
could pose a problem, because parts of the submarine are
undoubtedly flooded, and crewmembers could be incapacitated, and
ultimately killed, by the cold.

 &HT;    OHIOANS CHEER CLINTON DESPITE STATE PARTY'S DECLINE
 &HT;    Attn: Ohio points.
 &HT;    By BILL HERSHEY and MIKE WAGNER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton didn't have to show up Monday to
get a rousing, hooting-and-hollering standing ovation when Andrew
Cuomo invoked the president's name and record at a breakfast
meeting of the Ohio Democratic delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have done an historic job as president,'' said Cuomo,
secretary of housing and urban development. ``He will go down as
one of the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who gave his farewell to the convention Monday, still
gives Ohio Democrats something to cheer about, even if he's not in
the room with them.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to carry
the state in two presidential elections _ Roosevelt did it three
times _ and he ended a string of three Republican presidential
victories in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legacy to Ohio Democrats, however, is more complicated
than his winning record at the top of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   While he was winning the state twice, Democratic fortunes in
Ohio dipped to one of their all-time lows. Republicans control all
statewide administrative offices, both houses of the state
legislature, Ohio's delegation to the U.S. House and hold both Ohio
U.S. Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   As Cuomo pointed out, Clinton steered the national Democratic
Party to the political center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What President Clinton did, he brought this Democratic Party
to a place where it can win,'' said Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's success, however, didn't help Ohio Democrats, said
University of Akron political scientist John Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton had the good fortune or bad fortune to become
president in a period of transition in American politics. Clinton
brought the Democrats a middle-class constituency they haven't had
before,'' Green said. ``The bad news is he didn't help state and
local officials capitalize on that constituency. (But) in the long
run, this may bode well for the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Mark Owens, 43, Dayton Municipal Court clerk, said that
during the past eight years Democrats may have put too much
emphasis on winning the national election ``to the neglect of the
grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said grass-roots Democrats actually like Clinton, but
those who are liberals and labor union members aren't so enchanted
with the party's move to the center. ``They would like a more
liberal agenda, frankly,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor Monday, as delegates waited to hear from
their president one last time, there were more memories of good
days than of political disappointments in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made it impossible for Republicans to attack
Democrats like they used to, said Enid Goubeaux, Darke County
Democratic chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Bill Clinton came along we were the tax-and-spend
Democrats. Now we are the budget- and deficit-cutting Democrats,''
Goubeaux said. ``But more than any other president, Clinton has
operated under the premise that if one rises, we all rise. If one
falls, we all fall.''

 &HT;    HUNGER A REAL ISSUE TO GORE, ACTIVIST SAYS
 &HT;    By WILLIAM HERSHEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rep. Tony Hall leads by example in his crusade to
eliminate hunger but is always is on the lookout for allies _
particularly allies in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, Ohio's senior Democrat in the U.S. House, said Monday that
Al Gore as president would be sincerely committed to joining in the
anti-hunger battle.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore has called him three times to ask what can be done
to combat hunger in a country awash in prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance for the first time not only to end hunger but
to wipe it out,'' Hall told Ohio delegates to the Democratic
National Convention at their breakfast meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Later Hall said, ``(Gore) is the only person running for
president who has ever called me about this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, he said, is the only presidential candidate who has said
he wants to put this issue on his White House agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to make a major dent in it,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 58, has known Gore since the two men served together in
the U.S. House. Their tenure overlapped from 1979 through 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Hall fasted for 22 days to protest a House decision not
to reauthorize the Select Committee on Hunger. Locally, he has
sponsored gleaning programs to gather food to feed the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Without specifically criticizing President Clinton, Hall said he
he was disappointed that not more had been done recently to end
hunger in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no hunger in a time of prosperity,'' Hall
said. While most Americans have plenty to eat, the bottom 3 percent
suffer as much as citizens of Third World nations, he said.

COMPANIES THROW WEIGHT BEHIND LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Hoping to vault the Linux operating software
into the desktop market, a group of key companies are expected to
make a series of announcements Tuesday aimed at boosting Linux's
chance of becoming a viable alternative to Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM are
among the heavyweights to throw their support behind a new Linux
organization called the Gnome Foundation, whose goal is to spread
the adoption of Linux by creating a comprehensive suite of software
applications to lure consumers away from Microsoft's ubiquitous
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are set to make their pledges at LinuxWorld, a
gathering of Linux software developers in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual nonentity several years ago, the Linux operating
system has taken the computing world by storm. Because the source
code for Linux is freely available to anyone, it has attracted a
fanatical following among software developers. And because many
versions of Linux are free, it has also amassed a notable share of
the market. Last year, Linux commanded 24 percent of new US sales
of operating systems for server computers, compared with
Microsoft's 38 percent, according to IDC, a technology research
firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Linux is hardly a household brand, particularly within
the world of desktops, where it had just 4 percent of new sales
last year. Microsoft, by contrast, commanded 87 percent of that
market.
</P>
<P>
   One major reason why Linux hasn't caught on with consumers is
that it is relatively difficult to use. Gnome (pronounced guh-nome)
is setting out to solve that by promoting a single graphical user
interface developed by Helixcode in Cambridge, Mass. The interface
is supposed to make Linux as easy and intuitive to use as Windows
or or Apple Computer's Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is also set up to attack another problem _ the
scarcity of software applications that can run on Linux. In a coup
for the fledgling foundation, Sun Microsystems is expected to
announce that its StarOffice software package will be integrated
with Helixcode's Gnome user interface, said Miguel de Icaza,
Helixcode's chief technology officer. StarOffice rivals Microsoft's
Office products.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, Sun will incorporate Gnome on its
popular Solaris machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer market, Linux is expected to gain further
momentum from IBM, which is set to announce a line of ThinkPad
laptop computers that will run a Gnome version of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   While Linux continues to attract powerful allies, including Dell
Computer Corp., whose chief executive Michael Dell is scheduled to
deliver the keynote address at LinuxWorld, it remains unclear
whether Linux will ever unseat Microsoft's Windows as the premier
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Linux to be successful, a lot of people have to buy into
it,'' said Al Gillen, research manager at IDC. ``It's not a
no-brainer that this will all fall into place. There's still a lot
of work ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillen estimates that sales of the Linux operating system will
grow by more than 20 percent a year for the next five years, the
same growth rate he projects for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a surge in Linux shipments,'' Gillen said, ``but
we do not expect Linux to overtake Microsoft anytime soon.''

   CHINA: EDITOR DETAINED
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing police formally detained Bei Ling, the U.S.-based
editor of an independent literary journal. The move gives the
authorities 30 days to investigate Bei. It is not yet clear why he
was arrested, though the police have also seized several hundred
copies of his journal, which carries a photo of the exiled

   After talks with Yasser Arafat, President Jiang Zemin appeared
to sidestep supporting the Palestinian intention to declare an
independent state on Sept. 13 with or without a peace accord.
Although Arafat's spokesman said Jiang had expressed support for
``any Palestinian decision,'' Jiang said in a statement issued
after the meeting, ``We believe that the Palestinian National
Authority led by Arafat will think it over and declare statehood at
an appropriate time to achieve the best possible results.''

He told the group that the sales had raised much-needed cash and
could be abandoned only if the United States was willing to
compensate for it. The United States has been demanding that North
Korea abandon its missile development program, whose extent is not
fully known.

assassination of Vice President Luis Argana early last year
necessitated the election. An opposition candidate, Julio Cesar

allowing 5,200 traps out of season. Rejecting Ottawa's
interpretation that no more than 40 traps were to be set, the clan
set up a burning roadblock and parked 30 vehicles across Highway
11, a busy tourist road.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON EMERGES AS CANDIDATE IN HER OWN RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered both a soulful
message _ thanking the American people Monday night for ``your
faith and support in good times and in bad'' _ and a spirited call
to extend the Clinton era by electing Al Gore and Democratic
candidates like her.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable night _ the president saying good-bye to an
adoring party after eight, eventful White House years, Mrs. Clinton
emerging from her own tumultuous tenure as first lady and wronged
wife to propel herself into a high-profile and solo political
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone tell you this election doesn't matter,'' said
Mrs. Clinton, who is locked in a tight race to succeed retiring
Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. ``The
stakes in November are the biggest for those who are the littlest
among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who is struggling to woo women voters, reminded
the audience she had been an advocate for families while working at
the Children's Defense Fund and that the Republicans had borrowed
the group's trademark _ ``leave no child behind'' _ as their own
convention theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made great progress in the last eight years, but we
still have a lot of work to do,'' Mrs. Clinton said, according to
her remarks prepared for delivery. ``Because when a child can't go
to school without fearing guns and violence, that's a child left
behind. When a child's illness is treated too late, or not at all
because a hard-working parent can't afford health insurance, that's
a child left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a child struggles to learn in an overcrowded classroom,
that's a child left behind,'' said the first lady, assuring the
delegates that as president, Al Gore would leave no child behind.
</P>
<P>
   But a brief reference to her own domestic situation seemed the
most heartfelt for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that I can say tonight is: Thank
you,'' the first lady said. ``Thank you for giving me the most
extraordinary opportunity to work here at home and around the world
on issues that matter most ot children, families, and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your faith and support in good times and in bad.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the honor and privilege
of a lifetime,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's appearance capped a whirlwind Los Angeles
weekend of campaigning and fund-raising that drew some criticism
for overshadowing Al Gore's show. The first lady denied that was
her intention and was set to leave Los Angeles at 6 a.m. Tuesday
with her husband and daughter, Chelsea, to meet up with the vice
president in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's speech, delivered in the coveted slot just before
Clinton addressed the convention, was deemed a huge opportunity for
her to showcase her candidacy and boost her campaign. She previewed
it Monday in network interviews, appearances before the black and
Hispanic Democratic caucuses, at a Hollywood salute to women in
Congress, and in remarks at a New York delegation breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one choice in this election, whether we're
talking about president, vice president, or senator from New York,
and the right choice is to keep going forward together,'' said the
first lady, who was introduced as ``Senator Hillary Clinton'' to
the Empire State gathering at the Century Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Applause from the New Yorkers was sustained but not enthusiastic
as Mrs. Clinton thanked the state Democrats for their support and
promised to ``hit the ground running'' as a candidate after the
convention ends.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction probably reflected the anxiety of New York
Democrats who thought they had a winning celebrity candidate in
Mrs. Clinton. After 13 months of intense campaigning, the first
lady is in an unexpecedly tight race with Representative Rick
Lazio, a Long Island Republican who has no national reputation and
entered the contest late, after New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out because of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton continues to have trouble convincing white,
suburban women in New York that she is not exploiting either her
marital woes or her position as first lady to win a Senate seat.
She has not been able to completely erase her image as New York
carpetbagger, either, even though she spends almost all her time
now at their house in Chappaqua, N.Y., not the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a luncheon honoring Representative Nita Lowey, the New
York Democrat who probably would have run for the Senate if the
first lady had not jumped into the race, Mrs. Clinton said it was
``abolutely critical'' to elect women candidates who will protect
abortion rights and not roll back gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lowey said Mrs. Clinton's needs to draw clear
distinctions with her opponent on abortion and what she called the
Republican Party's ``antiwoman agenda. ``Once women understand the
differences between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio, they are going
to vote for Hillary Clinton,'' Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign has been quick to point out that Mrs. Clinton has a
prominent speaking role at the Democratic convention, while Lazio
turned down what he considered a bit part on the GOP program two
weeks ago in Philadelphia. Of course, Mrs. Clinton has friends in
high places in her party.
</P>
<P>
   She was certainly visible for the three days she spent in the
convention city. Friday, she went directly from the airport to an
appearance on Jay Leno's show. Saturday she attended a star-studded
tribute to her husband that was also a $1 million fund-raiser for
her campaign. Sunday, she raised $50,000 at a small luncheon and
then spoke at a large rally sponsored by several Jewish
organizations on the lot of Sony Pictures studio in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who needs support from New York's large Jewish
constituency, praised Gore's selection of Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut, and she noted they had been friends since
she was a student at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Mrs. Clinton leaves town _ she and the president will
take a short vacation later this week at Lake Placid, N.Y. _ she
will maintain a shadow presence in Los Angeles. Dozens of ``Hillary
ambassadors'' from New York have been organized by her campaign to
raise money, distribute literature, and promote Mrs. Clinton's
candidacy at events here through Thursday. Many supporters were
expected to watch her speech at fund-raising house parties across
New York Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the state chairman, called Mrs. Clinton's
campaigning here ``one more step in her bonding with the New York
Democratic Party.'' Hope said it was appropriate for the first lady
to leave after the convention's opening day, and Mrs. Clinton was
``very comfortable'' with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for this trip to be a transition where the
Clintons are closing one door and opening another door and handing
the baton to the vice president,'' Hope said. ``Mrs. Clinton
understands that and is very supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is giving a very important speech, she is spending time
with the New York delegation, and she is raising money,'' Hope
said. ``Those are three really important things for her.''

PLEAS BY FORMER CHIEF NOT THE FINAL CHAPTER IN DRUG INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Former Kansas City Chiefs running back Bam
Morris' guilty pleas to marijuana trafficking and money laundering
charges Monday include a provision that he cooperate with federal
authorities in their ongoing drug investigation in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative records reviewed by The Kansas City Star revealed
that at least two other former members of the Chiefs also could
come under federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those players has been charged in the case, nor did
they appear on the prosecution's list of witnesses for Morris'
trial, which was canceled after he pleaded guilty Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Those witnesses included Kimble Anders, Victor Riley, Eric
Warfield _ all currently playing with the Chiefs _ and Joe Horn of
the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to testify were the Chiefs' director of player
personnel, Lamonte Winston, and former Chiefs kick returner
Tamarick Vanover. Earlier this year Vanover pleaded guilty to
federal stolen-car charges and agreed to cooperate with
authorities. He is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Morris pleaded guilty Monday to joining Vanover in a
marijuana-smuggling scheme in the spring of 1999. Morris, 28,
acknowledged working with Vanover, former college friend Dewayne
Calvin Bryant and Robert Corey Myers of Warrensburg to transport
the marijuana from Texas to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Myers pleaded guilty earlier this month to drug
trafficking and money laundering and agreed to cooperate with
investigators. They are awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary estimates in his plea agreement, Morris
could face as many as 63 months in federal prison because of his
Kansas City convictions.
</P>
<P>
   His guilty pleas also could trigger a probation violation for a
previous drug conviction in Texas, where authorities have said he
could face as many as 10 more years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' lawyer, William Rork of Topeka, Kan., said he was
confident Morris could help prosecutors in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a betting man, I'd say it would lead to other
people,'' Rork said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. on Monday declined to discuss
future targets of his probe, but he noted that it was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing investigation, and Mr. Morris' plea agreement
speaks to that,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Morris has not begun cooperating with investigators, the
extent of his knowledge of further drug trafficking is unclear.
Evidence of other possible directions, however, appeared recently
in investigative records reviewed by The Star.
</P>
<P>
   In federal grand jury testimony earlier this year, a prisoner
acknowledged selling the designer drug Ecstasy at nightclubs, strip
bars and ``rave'' parties. In that capacity, the prisoner said, he
funneled drugs to a former member of the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with FBI agents earlier this year, two other
witnesses identified the same former Chiefs player as a ``heavy
user of cocaine'' known to possess and distribute drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of those witnesses, a woman, also identified another former
Chiefs player as a ``heavy cocaine user.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She believed he obtained cocaine for distribution from an
unknown source in Atlanta, Ga.,'' FBI agents reported after an
April 27 interview.
</P>
<P>
   And at least twice the name of a current NBA player has appeared
in FBI reports.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance a witness described the player as a ``good
friend'' of Vanover's friend and personal assistant, Gregory Burns,
who also has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges and is
cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents, however, were careful to note: ``(The witness) is
not aware if Burns has provided any cocaine or marijuana to (the
NBA player) for distribution among any (basketball) players....''
</P>
<P>
   In their investigation, prosecutors turned up a cocaine
transaction that previously had not been publicly disclosed but was
alluded to by Rork in a press conference after Morris' guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanover and Burns were involved in the distribution of drugs
long before Bam Morris'' got involved, Rork said.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a federal grand jury Feb. 25, Vanover
acknowledged that in the middle of the 1998 Chiefs season he
contributed $8,000 toward the purchase of cocaine Burns bought in
Miami for $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vanover's testimony, Burns returned with 2.2 pounds
of cocaine, which he sold in Kansas City without making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was it that you gave Greg Burns $8,000 to get some
cocaine?'' an assistant U.S. attorney asked Vanover.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said he needed it,'' Vanover replied. ``He didn't have
the whole amount.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it correct to say you did it to him as a favor?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Vanover said.
</P>
<P>
   In plea agreements for Vanover and Burns, prosecutors agreed
``not to file any additional charges...arising out of the present
offenses or investigation in the Western District of Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yonke, Vanover's lawyer, declined to discuss the cocaine
transaction but issued a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Tamarick Vanover was prepared to testify on behalf of
the government, pursuant to his plea agreement, he is relieved this
matter has been resolved without a long trial,'' Yonke said. ``I
find it unfortunate that while Bam Morris pleaded guilty today, his
attorney continues to attack Tamarick Vanover. Mr. Vanover has
accepted his responsibility from the outset of these matters, and
Bam Morris should do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who remained in federal custody, retired from pro
football in late January, ending a troubled NFL career. He was
acquired by the Chiefs in a trade with Chicago in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' career was marred by two four-game suspensions at the
beginning of the 1996 and the 1997 seasons for violating the NFL
substance-abuse policy. He spent three months in a Texas prison in
1998 after he missed a probation hearing. At that point he was
released by the Baltimore Ravens and subsequently signed as a free
agent by Chicago.

DOWNTOWN L.A. TRAFFIC LIGHTENS FOR THE DNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a surprise to visitors and residents alike,
traffic was relatively light across the Los Angeles region Monday,
the first working day of the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the open freeways recalled the days of the 1984
Olympics, when fear of mass congestion seemed to keep most of Los
Angeles at home or sent residents away on an extended summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morning commute wasn't bad,'' said Capt. Don Howard of the
city's Department of Transportation. ``I think a lot people are
apprehensive to come downtown and took this week off as a vacation.
But we're on a high level of awareness right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The only delays downtown Monday were caused by thousands of
demonstrators who filled the streets throughout the day, choking
street traffic. Authorities occasionally closed freeway off-ramps
during the demonstrations and blocked off streets, but traffic
resumed shortly after each wave of demonstrators cleared out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic has been relatively light so far, which is similar
to the '84 Olympics,'' said city DOT spokesman Tom Swire. ``The
only difference is that there is a lot more security here. It's a
whole different ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relative calm, officials were ready for a traffic
onslaught this week near Staples Center, where the convention is
being held through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 85 city
traffic officers helped direct motorists and monitor the streets,
while more than 100 cameras recorded traffic trends at downtown
intersections. Officials established a mobile command post near the
Los Angeles Coliseum as well, to monitor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership was down on the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's subway and rail systems Monday, too, but officials
monitored stations by camera and added security officers in case of
violent protesters, MTA spokesman Gary Wosk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If demonstrators became extremely unruly where the passengers'
safety was jeopardized, we would have to close it down,'' Wosk
said. ``We hope that surveillance cameras and extra security will
be a deterrent to any type of inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, officials began a DNC transportation services plan
that included extra shuttles and buses, and new routes around
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also planned on opening special bus and left-turn
lanes and they regulated green and red lights when traffic backed
up at intersections.

WOMAN ADMITS NEW YEAR'S EVE ATTEMPTED BANK ROBBERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 23-year-old Johnson County, Kan., woman
admitted Monday in U.S. District Court that she attempted a New
Year's Eve bank robbery that, for some people, competed for public
attention with millennium celebrations and the Y2K vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Pheng Siriboury pleaded guilty to one count of armed bank
robbery and one count of brandishing a firearm. In exchange for her
plea, the government will dismiss one count of taking hostages,
said Robert Streepy, an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking softly to Judge Carlos Murguia, Siriboury summed up the
failed robbery in simple words: ``I tried to rob the bank, and I
got scared.''
</P>
<P>
   She faces up to 25 years for the attempted bank robbery and a
minimum of seven years for brandishing the gun. She also faces a
fine of up to $250,000 for each count.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea agreement, Streepy recommended that, for the
bank robbery charge, Siriboury's sentence be at the lower end of
the guidelines. Murguia scheduled sentencing for Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Siriboury admitted in her plea that she entered a Bank of
America in Olathe, Kan., at 4:45 p.m. on Dec. 31, brandished a 9 mm
Ruger pistol and ordered tellers to get on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Siriboury also said that she ordered tellers to fill her blue
duffel bag with money and that as one of the tellers carried the
bag she pointed a gun at his head.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police and FBI tactical teams surrounded the bank at
175 N. Clairborne Road. They talked with Siriboury throughout the
evening. In all, 11 employees were trapped inside, including five
who hid and waited for a chance to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Siriboury released some of the hostages. Later an employee
disarmed Siriboury after she had placed the loaded gun on a desk.
About 1 a.m. FBI agents entered the bank and arrested her. No one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 6 court hearing, defense attorney Michael Harris
described the attempted robbery as an ``act of desperation''
prompted by financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said at the time that Siriboury was a native of Laos who
came to the Kansas City area with her parents when she was 2 years
old. She dropped out of Olathe North High School as a sophomore and
ran away from home after arguments with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Siriboury had run up gambling debts that might have
reached as high as $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   None of the details presented at the January hearing came out in
court Monday.

 &HT;    Internet furniture retailer living.com's future near crossroads
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Living.com is still alive, but for how long is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swirling around the Austin online furniture retailer over
the weekend had it closing up shop, filing for bankruptcy, being
acquired or acquiring another company. An announcement about the
future of the company, one of the highest-profile Internet startups
in Austin, could come as early as today, said people familiar with
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   While 2000 will go down as the year that Internet startups
flickered or flamed out _ including drkoop.com, carOrder.com and
garden.com _ this one has been one of the most promising local
ventures. Led by a successful entrepreneur and backed by plenty of
cash from seasoned venture capitalists, living.com had the markings
of success from its beginning two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials did not return phone calls Monday. But at a
company-wide meeting Friday, employees were told to ignore the
rumors while the company explored its options. They were also paid
for their accrued vacation time
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been hearing things,'' living.com spokesman
Andrew Springate said over the weekend. ``At this point, really
we're just not going to be able to comment publicly on anything.
We're exploring a number of options.''
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1998, living.com got off to an auspicious start.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Andrew Busey was a whiz kid who already had years of
experience in the Internet world and one successful startup, Acuity
Corp., behind him. His father, Jay Busey, joined him, bringing 35
years of experience in the furniture business.
</P>
<P>
   They envisioned an online superstore selling furniture from a
variety of manufacturers in a range of styles and eventually
broadened that to include accessories such as linens and small
appliances. The Internet would allow living.com to offer customers
more and to serve them faster than traditional furniture stores.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it launched its site in July 1999, living.com had
landed $41.5 million venture capital from some of the biggest names
in the business, including Silicon Valley's Benchmark Capital,
whose previous successes included eBay, the auction site. There was
competition from sites such as Furniture.com, but living.com
committed itself to spending heavily to draw consumers to its site,
including millions of dollars for network television ads during
prime-time shows.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market turned against Internet retailers in
April, the company had to put off hopes of holding an initial
public offering, to seek more private funding and to lay off 50 of
its 350 employees. Still, in an interview in June, Busey sounded
confident that living.com would survive the turmoil that was taking
down other dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, we're in a good business,'' Busey said. ``The
stuff we're selling people want to buy. It's a giant market. On a
marginal basis, we're making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Living.com was already stockpiling its most popular products at
a warehouse in North Carolina. It had attracted a high-caliber
chief executive in Shaun Holliday from Britain's Guinness Ltd.,
and, perhaps most notable, had forged a partnership with e-commerce
leader Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon agreed to take a minority stake in living.com and feature
the startup as its home furnishings store. The price tag for
living.com was steep, though: $145 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Amazon has agreed to renegotiate deals with its
e-commerce partners and reduce the amount of cash owed to it, but a
spokesman for the company would not say whether living.com was one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumers have not warmed to the idea of buying
furniture over the Internet and investors have lost interest in
almost any consumer-oriented Internet company. Furniture.com, for
example, reached the brink of bankruptcy this summer and is facing
multiple complaints from the Better Business Bureau. Established
brick-and-mortar retailers such as Eddie Bauer, Pottery Barn, Ikea
and Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond have expanded their online operations and
lured many customers away from the Internet-only stores.
</P>
<P>
   With about 500,000 monthly visitors in July, living.com was the
fourth most trafficked home decor site on the Internet, according
to PC Data Online Inc., a Reston, Va., research firm. The site was
rated first in customer service among home sites by Gomez Advisors
Inc., which surveys online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's high overhead has put a strain on its cash
reserves, former employees say, forcing living.com to go back to
its investors for more funding. It landed about $26 million from
Austin Ventures and Benchmark during the second quarter, according
to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Amazon.com to rescue living.com, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now Amazon is so focused on its own issues, its
own execution, its path to profitability, that anything that might
delay that is unlikely to happen,'' said Heath Terry, an analyst at
CS First Boston in San Francisco. ``The only way it would make
sense for Amazon to get involved with anyone ... is if it
accelerated their path to profitability, and that's certainly not
(living.com).''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens to living.com, Busey, 29, will still have a
high profile in Austin. Last year, he helped found NETPAC, a
lobbying group of high-tech executives opposed to Internet sales
taxes, accepted a seat on Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's Advisory Commission
on the Digital Economy, and won one of the inaugural Texas EComm
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Startups are stressful,'' Busey said in June. ``You get the
good and the bad. If it was all smooth sailing, there would be a
lot more startups.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: CLINTON SEEKS BALANCE OF LEAVING AND HELPING GORE
</HEADLINE>
  By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The transfer of power is one of the key tests of
democracy. At the governmental level, the United States has managed
it exceptionally well ever since George Washington, hero of the war
that brought the nation into being, handed over to John Adams in
1797.
</P>
<P>
   But before the reins of government can pass from one hand to
another, party leadership must be transferred, in a process for
which there is no set of statutes and no rulebook. It has often
proved difficult for sitting presidents, especially in the modern
era, when vice presidents more or less automatically seek the
presidency. So it has proved for President Clinton, despite largely
cordial relations with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Gore takes over the leadership of the
Democratic party this week. That was decided when he saw off his
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, in the primaries.
But what remains to be decided is how thoroughly he can put his
stamp on the party. Can he make it his own? Or will he be deemed
only second-best by the party faithful?
</P>
<P>
   Another question: Will Clinton really let go of the baton? The
Clintons hope, of course, to retain a presence in Washington in the
form of a New York Senate seat _ something the delegates here were
constantly reminded of _ and if they do so Clinton will surely be
part of that presence.
</P>
<P>
   That was the subtext Monday night as the president, wildly
popular among his fellow Democrats through the ups and downs of the
last eight years, appeared before the convention. The hard fact is
Gore needs help, most of all from Clinton. Paradoxically, he needs
both the enthusiastic endorsement of the president and his help in
escaping the long presidential shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In the prepared text of a speech that seemed at times more like
a State of the Union address than anything else, Clinton was
unstinting in his praise of his vice president. During ``the most
difficult days,'' the president said, Gore ``was always there.'' He
added: ``More than anybody else I've ever known in public life, Al
Gore understands the future and how sweeping changes can affect
Americans' daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Ronald Reagan, who promised at the 1988 convention
that he would gladly serve as ``a foot soldier'' in George Bush's
forthcoming campaign if needed, Clinton studiously avoided a pledge
to criss-cross the country this fall for Gore, at least in excerpts
released Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how I feel,'' he said. ``But it's not my decision to
make. It's yours. I just want to tell you a few things I know about
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Clintons will have spent more than three days
here by the time they leave on Tuesday morning. Before he spoke
Monday night, Clinton had delivered seven other officially
announced speeches Monday, and no doubt some off-hand remarks as
well. He and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who have raised
money with a zeal unmatched by any first family in history,
apparently saw no need to deviate from their routine during Gore's
big week here, even when the people closest to Gore gnashed their
teeth in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   They were almost as omnipresent as the morning mist this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Reagan's 1988 behavior was sharp. He spent
only 48 hours at the New Orleans convention that year, scheduled
only three public appearances and made a determined effort to
transfer some of his inner fire, and a bit of his electoral appeal,
to his more diffident No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, when the former president and his wife, Nancy,
again slipped offstage quickly and quietly, leaving Washington
without even staying for the post-inaugural lunch at the Capitol,
Elaine Crispen, Nancy Reagan's press secretary, explained their
attitude this way: ``It's a sense of what's right. It's their
party. It's the Bushes' victory. Let's let them enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially giving him only a lukewarm endorsement, Reagan
had campaigned hard for George Bush, the father of this year's
Republican nominee, emerging in the final days of the campaign as
Bush's main surrogate, particularly here in California. He traveled
some 25,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 1960 campaign, after describing himself as ``just a
spectator,'' Dwight D. Eisenhower leapt into the fray in a bid to
save the day for his vice president, Richard Nixon. It was a
stirring sight, James Reston wrote in The New York Times that fall,
``the old pro coming off the bench and swinging for the fences for
the last time.'' John F. Kennedy won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will do the same remains up in the air.
Democratic state chairmen from New Jersey to Wisconsin to Oregon
have been pressing Clinton to stump hard for Gore, in the hope that
he could brighten a campaign that has often seemed inert and
uninspired. The White House has said it will let Gore make the
decision, but the chairmen, by and large, think the president's
presence on the trail is worth the gamble that he might well remind
voters how much more exciting than his protege he can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have the president in this state every chance I got,''
said Kam Kuwata, a California campaign consultant. ``We need the
energy, and he's the one who has the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are Clinton will answer the call. Sooner or later, as
election day approached, each one of the presidents since World War
II whose vice presidents were seeking to succeed them has felt the
pull of the stump.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has never had a coup d'etat. It shares that
distinction with Britain and only a few other countries. In fact,
only once in more than two hundred years has the outcome of a
national election, and hence the right to the presidency, been
seriously disputed. That was in 1876, when the Democrats charged
that the Republicans had stolen the election for Rutherford B.
Hayes, and even then, the inaugural went ahead right on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But president after president has wrestled with the question of
his own succession. Eisenhower tried in 1955 to ease Nixon out of
the Cabinet, toying with the names of Henry Cabot Lodge and Nelson
A. Rockefeller as possible replacements. Asked five years later to
name ``a major idea'' of Nixon's that he had adopted,'' the
president answered, in a tone of overwhelming boredom, ``If you
give me a week, I might think of one. I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   In his turn, Nixon decided in the spring of 1971 that John
Connally, the former governor of Texas, should be his successor,
not Spiro Agnew. But when Agnew was forced to resign in 1973, Nixon
was unable to win assurances of confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was as conflicted as Lyndon B. Johnson. He was
furious that his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, harbored doubts
about the Vietnam War, and he told friends that ``Hubert cries too
much.'' For a time, he toyed with the idea of trying to get himself
drafted for another term in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Nov. 3, 1968, at the tail-end of the campaign, did he
give his full-throated backing to Humphrey, standing next to him at
the Astrodome in Houston and shouting, ``That man, my friend and
co-worker for 20 years, is a healer and a builder and will
represent all of the people all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between Clinton and Gore never became as severe as
those in some past administrations. But this handoff has not been
without significant friction, and Gore can afford little more of
that.

   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Bradley sometimes seemed reluctant to
campaign for himself in the Democratic presidential primary season.
During a charity walk through downtown Des Moines last fall, he was
surrounded by hundreds of people and managed to speak to none for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   What campaign effort will the former senator and basketball star
mount now for Al Gore, whom he once called a liar but has since
endorsed? Democrats would like to know, one week after watching
Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain campaign across California with
and for GOP nominee George W. Bush, his former rival.
</P>
<P>
   But, at a time when some Democrats say there is little room for
error if Gore is to overtake Bush, the answer about Bradley is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went zestfully through one loyalty rite Monday, formally
telling the 359 delegates he won in the primaries to vote for
Gore's nomination at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Al Gore will stand for the things we fought for
in our campaign and he deserves our support,'' he said at a rally
that resembled his campaign events seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley, who endorsed Gore at a Wisconsin rally last month,
will address the convention tonight in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions mirror McCain's pro-Bush output during the GOP
convention. And Bradley has made it clear that his political
differences with Gore were tiny compared to the differences he
would have with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood here, as well as political factors, suggest that
Bradley won't be able to boost Gore's candidacy as much as McCain
can help Bush's _ and that Bradley isn't planning to try anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has yet to work out any details with the Gore staff
about campaigning for the vice president, spokesman Eric Hauser
said. Also, Bradley is planning to go on a pre-election business
tour to promote a book he just wrote about campaign reform, health
care, racial unity and other issues he raised in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be active for Democrats across the country, including
obviously the vice president,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the toss-up Midwestern states, Bradley doesn't carry the
same clout as McCain in speaking out for his party's nominee, said
political scientist Emmett Buell of Denison University in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Buell said, ``the story was that McCain
was a winner and Bradley wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain beat Bush in Michigan and elsewhere before fading.
Bradley's best showing was 48 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.
He failed to win a single state against Gore, but picked up
delegates, including 11 in Texas, through a proportionate award
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain appealed to independent voters, partly with
their call for campaign finance reform. But in terms of public
attention, ``McCain sort of cornered the market on campaign finance
reform,'' Buell said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Democratic Party platform tacitly recognizes that.
Without mentioning Bradley's matching stance on changing the way
elections are financed, it says the party backs McCain's proposals
to limit campaign contributions from special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bradley can help Gore most, Buell said, is in the appeal
to black voters, liberals and others who form the Democratic voting
base. Although Gore captured most of the black vote in the
primaries, Bradley was backed by prominent blacks such as author
Cornel West, filmmaker Spike Lee and basketball legend Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of any limits on Bradley's pull, Buell said, the
Democratic Party will expect Bradley to help Gore catch Bush in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters say he has already contributed by making Gore
a better campaigner. The vice president has acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush backers are using Bradley's words to bolster their
contention that Gore is untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as a
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked Gore in a primary debate. His complaint was that Gore had
fudged on his own congressional voting record while distorting
Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those comments Monday, Bradley told AP, ``I'm not
going to rehash the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's delegates booed in Philadelphia when he
released them to vote Bush. There was no such showing of dissent at
Bradley's rally Monday. But Gore campaign manager Bill Daley, who
showed up to thank Bradley for the endorsement, acknowledged that
the delegates are getting over hard feelings about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is impossible to give the sort of enthusiasm ...
that you felt for Bill Bradley,'' Daley told the delegates, but
unity for Gore is essential.
</P>
<P>
   New York City lawyer Arthur Schiff said he and his fellow
delegates would back Gore without any wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like the way he (Gore) campaigned but ultimately
they were very close in their beliefs,'' said Schiff, no relation
to Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff.

NEWS CORP. CONFIRMS BUYING CHRIS-CRAFT FOR ITS 10 TV STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ News Corp. confirmed Monday that it had agreed to
acquire Chris-Craft Industries, which owns 10 television stations,
paying about $85 per share using stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp., which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and owns the
Fox network, put the total price at $5.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. will buy Chris-Craft; BHC Communications Inc., a
company controlled by Chris-Craft; and United Television Inc.,
which is controlled by BHC.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. will own 33 stations after the purchase, with two
stations in five cities, including New York and Los Angeles, the
two biggest television markets. But the company said Monday that it
would sell about $650 million worth of its stations to comply with
Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit a
company's stations from reaching more than 35 percent of the
nation's television market.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. is paying a premium for Chris-Craft, roughly 18 times
the estimated 1999 cash flow, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has assured investors that by selling some
stations and improving cash flow at the remaining stations _
particularly in markets where it will have two stations _ it can
drastically improve overall cash flow so that shareholders will be
paying a far lower multiple, perhaps as little as nine times cash
flow. The recent industry average is about 13 times cash flow,
according to Chris Dixon, a media analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry experts questioned News Corp.'s figure Monday,
saying that it was unlikely Murdoch could get such cost savings out
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts agreed that the purchase had value not only
because of the power it would give Murdoch in markets like New
York, where he will own WWOR and WNYW, but also because it will
assure additional outlets for the reruns of Fox shows like
``X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Viacom had been a bidder for Chris-Craft, but lost to News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One Chris-Craft shareholder, who requested his name not be used,
said he was not happy with the deal because Chris-Craft had
rejected an offer of $82 a share from Viacom in May, when Viacom
shares were trading at $56. Since then, Viacom shares have risen 28
percent. The outlook for News Corp., he said, is far less certain.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. will receive $1.7 billion in cash that is on the
balance sheets of the three companies it's buying. News Corp. will
use it to pay part of the cash component of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. said it will place the TV stations with Fox
Entertainment Group, the entertainment company of which it owns
82.76 percent, in exchange for 122.2 million shares in Fox. That
will increase News Corp.'s stake in Fox to 85.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp.'s acquisition is complex.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft owns 80 percent of the common stock of BHC and 57
percent of United Television's common stock. In each case, News
Corp. is offering cash and preferred shares for the outstanding
stock. In total, News Corp. said it would pay $2.1 billion in cash
and issue about 73 million American depository receipts, each of
which represents four News Corp. shares, for a total of 292 million
preferred shares.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Schwarzman, head of the Media Access Project, which
represents the public at the FCC, said he is opposed to the deal
because of the danger it poses to media diversity both locally and
nationally. He said Monday that he viewed it as ``an arrogant bet
on the outcome of the election.``
</P>
<P>
   He said it was unlikely that the current FCC would approve the
deal, but that a Republican-appointed FCC would be more
sympathetic. A number of the five positions at the FCC are expected
to change in the next administration.

DOWNTOWN L.A. TRAFFIC LIGHTENS FOR THE DNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a surprise to visitors and residents alike,
traffic was relatively light across the Los Angeles region Monday,
the first working day of the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the open freeways recalled the days of the 1984
Olympics, when fear of mass congestion seemed to keep most of Los
Angeles at home or sent residents away on an extended summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morning commute wasn't bad,'' said Capt. Don Howard of the
city's Department of Transportation. ``I think a lot people are
apprehensive to come downtown and took this week off as a vacation.
But we're on a high level of awareness right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The only delays downtown Monday were caused by thousands of
demonstrators who filled the streets throughout the day, choking
street traffic. Authorities occasionally closed freeway off-ramps
during the demonstrations and blocked off streets, but traffic
resumed shortly after each wave of demonstrators cleared out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic has been relatively light so far, which is similar
to the '84 Olympics,'' said city DOT spokesman Tom Swire. ``The
only difference is that there is a lot more security here. It's a
whole different ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relative calm, officials were ready for a traffic
onslaught this week near Staples Center, where the convention is
being held through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 85 city
traffic officers helped direct motorists and monitor the streets,
while more than 100 cameras recorded traffic trends at downtown
intersections. Officials established a mobile command post near the
Los Angeles Coliseum as well, to monitor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership was down on the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's subway and rail systems Monday, too, but officials
monitored stations by camera and added security officers in case of
violent protesters, MTA spokesman Gary Wosk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If demonstrators became extremely unruly where the passengers'
safety was jeopardized, we would have to close it down,'' Wosk
said. ``We hope that surveillance cameras and extra security will
be a deterrent to any type of inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, officials began a DNC transportation services plan
that included extra shuttles and buses, and new routes around
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also planned on opening special bus and left-turn
lanes and they regulated green and red lights when traffic backed
up at intersections.

A BIG COMEBACK WITH A SMALL, UGLY SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates with result.) 
By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Teammates Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres renewed
their engaging swimming rivalry Monday night at the Olympic trials,
representing the wonder and suspicion that attends women's swimming
at the elite international level.
</P>
<P>
   The night's competition came in the 100-meter freestyle, which
Thompson won in 54.07 seconds, an American record. Torres was
second in 54.62, so both qualified at that distance for the 2000
Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Both swimmers had the luxury of knowing they had qualified
earlier in the 100-meter butterfly, which Thompson won over Torres
last Thursday. They will meet again Wednesday in the 50-meter
freestyle and, a month from now, they will challenge Inge de Bruijn
of the Netherlands, who holds world records in all three of the
sprints.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Thompson, who is 27, and Torres, who is 33,
represent the multitudinous possibility for women in this age of
Olympic professionalism and gender equity fostered by Title IX.
Once, female swimmers had to retire in high school, with no college
scholarships or moneymaking opportunities available to them. Now,
they can keep their careers buoyant on prize money and
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, in particular, is a species as rare as a snail darter _
the female athlete still competing among the world's best as she
nears her mid-30s. She returned to swimming last year after a
seven-year retirement in which she worked as a fashion model and
television personality. She is talented and effervescent and has
overcome a battle with bulimia. Apparently, no swimmer has ever
taken such a long sabbatical, then seriously challenged for an
Olympic medal. She will be the first American swimmer ever to
compete in four Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   But no Olympic sport has been compromised by the use of
performance-enhancing drugs as women's swimming has been, and the
singular aspect of Torres' career that makes it celebratory also
has led to skepticism about her performances that even her coach
acknowledges have clouded any accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Torres has never failed a drug test, and no other swimmer or
coach here has accused her of take banned, performance-enhancing
substances. But after three decades of demonstrated cheating in
this sport involving East German and Chinese athletes, the 1996
Irish Olympic champion Michelle Smith and even American athletes, a
despairing ritual has become the habit in swimming and almost every
other Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Though testing is conducted at all major meets, no tests have
been approved for substances that athletes are believed to be
widely using such as EPO and human growth hormone. Cheaters have
become sophisticated by using synthetic versions of substances that
exist naturally in the body and are difficult to detect. An EPO
test may be implemented at the Sydney Games, but the International
Olympic Committee's own doctors are saying privately that they fear
the tests will not withstand legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, coaches and athletes concede, passing a drug test
no longer provides convincing evidence of being drug-free. In such
a climate of uncertainty, every remarkable performance becomes
suspicious, and news conferences have become tense give-and-takes
involving skepticism and denial.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, the coach of the American women's Olympic swim
team, said in an interview that he understood the distrust. He was
among the loudest in his skepticism about the Chinese, who have had
some three dozen swimmers test positive in the 1990s, and Smith,
who was banned last year after having contaminated one of her drug
tests with alcohol and having previously tested positive for
androstenedione. He said he blamed the IOC for betraying athletes
who do not take drugs, because, given the current testing
deficiencies, the innocent can no longer prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that sport is at the point where every great
performance has a cloud over it,'' said Quick, who coaches both
Thompson and Torres in Palo Alto, Calif. He added: ``I'm bitter
toward the IOC They've allowed cheating to go on far too long. They
are a lot more into sponsorship money and television money. They
are a lot more concerned about many things other than the rights of
fair competition for athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   His athletes are clean, Quick said. Torres is at the cutting
edge of nutrition, strength and flexibility training, he said, and
she works out ravenously. And, he pointed out, she did not come
from nowhere. Before she retired after the 1992 Summer Games,
Torres won two Olympic gold medals on relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's a huge miracle that I'm swimming
faster,'' Torres said. ``This is what I think was in me when I was
younger. The circumstances weren't right. I had an eating problem.
Training is better for me. Nutrition is better for me. Everything
is in a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a supporter in what may seem to an unexpected place.
Phil Whitten, the editor of Swimming World magazine, has been at
the forefront of revealing widespread drug use in swimming. His
magazine first published reports from the files of the East German
police that uncovered the state-sponsored system of cheating in the
sport. But he said he was not suspicious about Torres, given her
history of swimming fast, and the new training techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Thompson and Torres here has focused on
their own relationship, which appears respectful if not cordial.
Thompson is from New Hampshire, a taciturn Yankee, though she has
drawn much attention, and some criticism, for posing without a top
on in the current issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. (She said
she posed so that girls could see that it was OK to have a muscular
appearance.) Torres is from Beverly Hills, sunny and gregarious.
They train at different times, Torres saying that workouts became
too intense together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two great athletes desired a lot of individual attention and
somewhat demanded it,'' Quick said.

 &HT;    Bush plans to issue two pardons
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Gov. George W. Bush announced Monday that he
will issue pardons ``for innocence'' to two men, including one
serving a life sentence, because of serious doubts about their
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate sentenced to life in prison, Roy Wayne Criner, 35,
had been convicted by a Montgomery County jury of sexually
assaulting a 16-year-old girl, Deanna Ogg. She had been found
murdered in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the Board of Pardons and Paroles that credible
new evidence raises substantial doubt about the guilty of Roy
Criner, and that he should receive a pardon,'' Bush said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended in an 18-0 vote Monday that Criner be
pardoned. New DNA evidence casts doubt on his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The other man the board recommended for a pardon was Ronnie Mark
Gariepy, 41, who is on parole for a sexual assault he was accused
of committing in 1991 against his stepdaughter, then 13, in
Hutchison County.
</P>
<P>
   Gariepy had asked for a pardon after the girlrecanted. Hutchison
County officials, including the district attorney and the sheriff,
recommended that Gariepy's request be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Criner's attorney, Michael Charlton of Houston, said he had not
yet talked to his client but hopes to see him walk free today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased, yes, that it's finally happening now, that I'll
get to see him walk out,'' Charlton said of the pardon. ``I'm
still, I suppose, angry and frustrated that it took so long, that
the Court of Criminal Appeals didn't do it two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Criner, who served 10 years in prison, was in the Montgomery
County Jail on Monday, not his state prison cell. He was in
Montgomery County awaiting a court hearing today on whether he
could be released on bond pending action by the Board of Pardons
and Parole-- .
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor's office said the pardon might take
a day or two of paperwork, but Charlton said he hope-- to get
Criner out one way or the other today _ either on bond or a with a
completed pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Criner has always claimed innocence. A state appeals court in
Beaumont reversed his 1990 conviction in 1991. A year later, the
Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the lower court and upheld the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, DNA tests indicated that the semen found in the dead
girl's body was not Criner's, and the trial judge recommended a new
trial. The Court of Criminal Appeals said no in a 6-3 vote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent DNA test on a cigarette butt found at the crime
scene also did not match Criner's DNA. That helped persuade the
trial judge and the district attorney and sheriff of Montgomery
County to recommend a pardon last month.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Bush plans to issue two pardons
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Gov. George W. Bush announced Monday that he
will issue pardons ``for innocence'' to two men, including one
serving a life sentence, because of serious doubts about their
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate sentenced to life in prison, Roy Wayne Criner, 35,
had been convicted by a Montgomery County jury of sexually
assaulting a 16-year-old girl, Deanna Ogg. She had been found
murdered in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the Board of Pardons and Paroles that credible
new evidence raises substantial doubt about the guilty of Roy
Criner, and that he should receive a pardon,'' Bush said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended in an 18-0 vote Monday that Criner be
pardoned. New DNA evidence casts doubt on his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The other man the board recommended for a pardon was Ronnie Mark
Gariepy, 41, who is on parole for a sexual assault he was accused
of committing in 1991 against his stepdaughter, then 13, in
Hutchison County.
</P>
<P>
   Gariepy had asked for a pardon after the girlrecanted. Hutchison
County officials, including the district attorney and the sheriff,
recommended that Gariepy's request be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Criner's attorney, Michael Charlton of Houston, said he had not
yet talked to his client but hopes to see him walk free today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased, yes, that it's finally happening now, that I'll
get to see him walk out,'' Charlton said of the pardon. ``I'm
still, I suppose, angry and frustrated that it took so long, that
the Court of Criminal Appeals didn't do it two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Criner, who served 10 years in prison, was in the Montgomery
County Jail on Monday, not his state prison cell. He was in
Montgomery County awaiting a court hearing today on whether he
could be released on bond pending action by the Board of Pardons
and Parole-- .
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor's office said the pardon might take
a day or two of paperwork, but Charlton said he hope-- to get
Criner out one way or the other today _ either on bond or a with a
completed pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Criner has always claimed innocence. A state appeals court in
Beaumont reversed his 1990 conviction in 1991. A year later, the
Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the lower court and upheld the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, DNA tests indicated that the semen found in the dead
girl's body was not Criner's, and the trial judge recommended a new
trial. The Court of Criminal Appeals said no in a 6-3 vote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent DNA test on a cigarette butt found at the crime
scene also did not match Criner's DNA. That helped persuade the
trial judge and the district attorney and sheriff of Montgomery
County to recommend a pardon last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office said the governor has issued 18 pardons, including
Criner's and Gariepy's, since taking office in January 1995,
including five known as a ``pardon for innocence.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CONFEDERATE FLAG ISSUE NEEDS HELP OF ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January 1994, when the Confederate flag issue was beginning
to percolate, a group of 20 sportswriters covering Super Bowl
XXVIII in Atlanta decided to be part of a solution, not the
problem. We planned an impromptu, low-key demonstration to protest
the presence of the Confederate flag outside the Georgia Dome.
There was something irksome about having to walk back and forth
with those stars and bars waving overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Our presence was tacit acceptance of the symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   When the color guard marched out for the national anthem, the
group _ men, women, blacks, whites, Jews and gentiles _ left the
press area and stood in a corridor. No words were spoken; the group
listened intently to the anthem. When the final note ended,
everyone returned to the seats and began working. And that was
that. So we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven years later, the Confederate flag issue has moved
squarely back into the sports arena. Last week, the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference asked the National Collegiate
Athletic Association to remove the 2002 men's basketball Final Four
and the 2003 women's Final Four from Atlanta if the state does not
remove the Confederate emblem from its flag. The SCLC said that if
the flag was not redesigned by March 2001, it would call for a
boycott of the events.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the NCAA executive committee said it would consider
the request and in another matter voted to play the first- and
second-round men's basketball tournament games in 2002 in South
Carolina, the scene of a hard-nosed, bare-knuckle fight over the
Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wethington, the executive committee chairman and
president of the University of Kentucky, said the committee would
monitor each situation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's vote last week ran counter to a resolution drawn
up last season by the National Association of Basketball Coaches
calling for first- and second-round games not to be played in South
Carolina unless the Confederate flag was removed from the
Statehouse grounds. ``I wanted to take it down and put it in a
damned museum,'' John Chaney, the Temple coach, said Monday. ``The
NCAA seems to care more about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is substantial: $50 million in lost revenue for
Atlanta for the men's Final Four and $25 million for the women's.
In the same meeting the NCAA committee approved a $325.6 million
budget for fiscal 2000-1. Most of that money comes from
television-rights income and revenue from licensing and royalties.
The primary source of the revenue is men's and women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, Chaney was asked, if Temple reached the Final
Four in 2002?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the issue is not resolved, if people like the NAACP are
still fighting, damn right: I'd hold hands with them,'' he said.
``It would be difficult to tell the team not to go, but I can tell
my team why I'm not going.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney wants a fight. The battle needs new young blood. The
fight needs students and student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If college and professional athletes were in lock step, that
flag would come down immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney thinks that is pretty unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bellies are full,'' he said. ``People are serving money
now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for players joining the protest? ``Players are selfish,'' he
said. ``They are loyal to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney called for athletes to adopt the salmon instinct.
``Salmon is the only species that swims upstream,'' he said. ``We
need some people with guts, with the courage to swim upstream, swim
against the tide. Racism and bigotry are here, worse than ever. The
only ones who see it are old people, hard for us to get off the
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Dempsey, president of the NCAA agrees with Chaney that
racism is still prevalent. He is not certain of the role the NCAA
should play, or could play, to fight racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very long discussions about this,'' Dempsey said in an
interview Monday. ``What is our role and are we putting the
student-athlete in hostile environments?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In South Carolina, the state did what we asked,'' he said in a
reference to removal of the flag from atop the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it was right to ask for one thing where that
demand was met to then say, `No, well now we want this,''' he
added, commenting on the fact that there is now objection to the
flag being on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The flags are flying, the games will go on, the coffers will be
filled. But that flag is still the evidence of things unseen.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated her husband's
years in office, proclaimed her faith in Al Gore and used the
moment to advance her bid for the Senate Monday night as she
luxuriated in a level of attention unimaginable for a candidate
conducting her first campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton arrived at the convention hall Monday night,
she had been interviewed by all three network anchors for segments
on the evening news, as well as by CNN's Larry King, a feast of
prime-time exposure that left her aides ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in her interviews and in excerpts selected by her staff
for early release, went to considerable lengths to talk up the
credentials of Gore, as she described the nation's health in
glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment _ the
most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's
history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her interest in her own race for Senate in New York was
equally evident, as she suggested that voters who wanted to
continue the policies of her husband should vote not only for Gore
for president, but for her for senator against Rep. Rick Lazio, her
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that I can say tonight is thank
you,'' Clinton said, according to the advance excerpts. ``Thank you
for giving me the most extraordinary opportunity to work here at
home and around the world on the issues that matter most to
children, families and women. Thank you for your faith and support
in good times and in bad. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,
for the honor and privilege of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   With her speech, Clinton ended one of the more unusual political
trips undertaken by a candidate running for office from New York.
She spent four days in California, and while the purpose of the
trip was to accompany the president for his last convention as a
sitting president, she turned almost every moment into a way to
advance her own campaign for Senate: raising money, giving
interviews to New York newspapers and television stations and,
Monday night, giving the speech and sitting down for interviews
with Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Lazio went to Planet Hollywood to mock Clinton's
efforts on Monday afternoon, as his aides discouraged the argument
that it would do her any good in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is being here in New York,'' Lazio said,
standing in front of a cut-out photo of Sylvester Stallone. ``I
think the most important thing is to be in New York and talk about
New York issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prepared remarks of her speech, and in her interviews
with the television anchors, Clinton spoke about her husband, Gore
and issues that, while national in scope, offered a glimpse for a
national audience of what she had been saying in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made great progress in the last eight years, but we
still have a lot of work to do,'' she said. ``Because when a child
can't go to school without fearing guns and violence _ that's a
child left behind. When a child's illness is treated too late _ or
not at all _ because a hard-working parent can't afford health
insurance _ that's a child left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no mention of Lazio in the prepared excerpts of her
remarks. She was more discursive in the interviews she taped during
the day with the network anchors, using a question about why some
voters disliked the Clintons as a way of hitting the issues she has
used to distinguish herself from Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not people that are ever going to vote for me and
what I stand for,'' she said on CBS. ``You know, they aren't
pro-choice, they are happy to let the gun lobby, you know, decide
what our laws are. They have a very different view of where we
should go when it comes to the future of New York and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that Clinton agreed to such an extensive schedule
of network interviews was notable. She has until now resisted doing
interviews with the national media, as her aides argued it would
not help _ and might actually hurt _ her effort to transform
herself into a candidate running for office from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, Clinton's advisers have concluded that the
key to winning the contest with Lazio is to present the issues in
partisan, Republican-Democratic terms, rather than as a referendum
on Clinton herself.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they said Monday, they have decided to encourage coverage
of Clinton as she attends what is in effect a four-day celebration
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lazio paid only a cursory visit to the Republican
convention, and did not participate in any of its official events. &QL;

CLINTON CITES GAINS UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With his vice president striving to succeed him,
and his wife running for the US Senate, President Clinton Monday
night rejected Republican claims that his administration
``coasted'' through prosperity and pleaded for the nation to
entrust the White House to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the Democratic National Convention
inevitably moved some to remember the darker chapters of his
presidency _ the affair, the impeachment, the senate trial _ but
the president used his convention swan song at the Staples Center
to focus on the future. Reprising his 1996 convention call to build
a bridge to the 21st Century, Clinton urged the nation not to
reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with confidence: We
built our bridge to the 21st Century,'' Clinton said, according to
remarks prepared for delivery. ``We crossed it together. And we're
not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance, while much anticipated by the adoring
partisan crowd, was tinged with trepidation about the possibility
that the president's appearance would overshadow nominee-in-waiting
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Clinton's speech, Democrats hoped that
Clinton would use his rhetorical wizardry to remind voters of how
far the nation has come since the Clinton-Gore team defeated
then-President Bush in 1992. But at the same time, the vice
president's campaign was anxious to dim the Clinton spotlight and
turn the focus to Gore's race against Bush's son, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign script for the four-day convention focuses on
courting moderate voters, and highlighting the life and leadership
traits of Gore and his vice presidential candidate, Senator Joseph
Lieberman. Lieberman was picked partly for his reputation for moral
rectitude and for condemnation of Clinton's behavior with former
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, was pure Clinton, as the president displayed
his star power as he hop-scotched the city, was serenaded by
celebrities and drew roar after roard from the convention crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived at the convention amid a mixture of triumph and
embarrassment, taking credit for the sterling economy but aware
that many Americans will always remember him for his affair with an
intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's sorry, what else can he do,'' said Virginia
Benedict, a Maryland delegate. ``I'm very dedicated to the
president. Monica Lewinsky -- that doesn't put food on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beverly White, a Utah delegate who praised Clinton's job
performance, acknowledged that some television viewers will have
mixed emotions hearing Clinton. ``I like Clinton,'' she said. But
``he needs his butt kicked, speaking as a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered a speech designed to evoke Reaganesque
optimism, portraying America as a place that is much better than
when he and Gore took office in 1993, and not just because of the
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our progress is about far more than economics,'' he said.
``America is more confident, hopeful and just, more secure and
free, because we offered a vision and worked together to achieve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   America, Clinton said, is more confident because of progress in
education, and more just because of the way tax cuts have been
targeted to help families pay for college and poor people to move
into the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to claims at last month's GOP convention that the
administration had coasted through its economic prosperity rather
than used it to fix big problems like Social Security, Clinton,
without uttering Bush's name, said the nation's progress was not
something that happened accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident, that we coasted along, let's be clear: America's success
was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today America faces another choice, every bit as momentous as
the one eight years ago. For what a nation does with good fortune
is just as stern a test of its character, values and vision a how
it deals with adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The president then launched into a testimonial for Gore, who has
long labored in Clinton's shadow and often been caricatured as
somone who has trouble ``connecting'' with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the biggest choice you have to make is in the
presidential race. Now, you know how I feel. But it's not my
decision to make. It's yours. I just want to tell you a few things
I know about Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked closely together for eight years now. In the most
difficult days of the last years, when we faced the toughest issues
_ of war and peace, of taking on powerful special interests _ he
was always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else I've known in public life, Al Gore
understands the future and how sweeping changes can affect
Americans' daily lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave himself and Gore credit for overseeing the longest
economic expansion in American history that has produced 22 million
new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, and the highest
income home ownership rate in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity going by
paying down the debt, investing in education and health care, and
in family tax cuts that we can afford,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In stark contrast, the GOP wants to spend every dime of our
projected surplus and then some _ leaving nothing for education or
Medicare prescription drugs, nothing to extend the life of Medicare
and Social Security, nothing for emergencies, nothing in case the
projected surpluses don't come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not be higher for Gore, with polls showing the
vice president trailing Republican George W. Bush, though the
margin varies from poll to poll. And Gore faces a tough set of
problems as he pursues Bush: lingering voter discontent with
Clinton's affair, the lack of an overwhelming issue and a battle on
the left with Green Party nominee Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The president was introduced by his wife, Hillary, who is
running for the US Senate seat from New York. ``I still believe `It
takes a village,'' Mrs. Clinton said, quoting the title of her
book, according to prepared remarks. ``And it certainly takes Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman. They have what it takes. And they'll do
what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearances by the Clintons overshadowed the night's
carefully scripted focus on ``prosperity and progress.'' Adopting a
talk-show format, the convention stage was used for a
self-congratulatory panel discussion on economic ``success
stories'' and ``issues for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Republicans honored living former presidents at their
convention, the Democrats showed a video tribute to former
President Jimmy Carter, who is more popular today than when he was
in office. Carter, appearing in the convention hall, flashed his
famous grin and stood in acknowledgement of the cheers from the
delegates. And, just as Republicans sought to present themselves as
diverse, the Democrats featured an appearance by six female US
senators.

been confined to attractions on the outskirts of the city:
Disneyland, Hollywood, the beach, Beverly Hills, Universal Studios.

just in time. Nhan Le checks the tomatoes at La Huerta Produce

  FIRST LADY DELIVERS EMOTIONAL SPEECH AT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
 &HT;    (EDs: STORY will be updated)
 &HT;    By JUDY HOLLAND 
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking as first lady and
as a candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York, told delegates to
the Democratic National Convention in an emotional speech Monday
night that after eight years of her husband's tenure, ``I am proud
to stand here at this extraordinary moment _ the most peaceful,
prosperous, promising time in our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she urged them to work for the election of the ticket they
will officially nominate later this week. ``Now we can continue
America's progress by electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman the next
president and vice president of the United States,'' she declared
in her prepared 10-minute prime-time speech.
</P>
<P>
   And while not directly touting her own campaign, she said, ``For
me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll
have the privilege of serving them in the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hoped her and her husband's starring roles on the
opening night of the convention before 4,368 delegates and 600
alternates will bolster her candidacy for the New York Senate in
the tight race against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island.
Two weeks ago Lazio declined an invitation to address the
Republican National Convention two weeks ago, saying he preferred
to concentrate on his campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton focused Monday night on family themes and
referred to her longtime goal: ``Leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   She also thanked the country for granting her family eight years
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for giving me the most extraordinary opportunity to
work here at home and around the world on the issues that matter
the most to children, families and women,'' she said, signaling to
New York voters that she has been more than a traditional first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your faith and support in good times _ and in
bad. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the honor and
privilege of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Her speech appeared squarely aimed at women, a key voting bloc
in her adopted state of New York where she is trailing Lazio among
white women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute poll put her
ahead, 46 percent to 43 percent. But a few days earlier, the Utica,
N.Y.-based Zogby International Pollfound Lazio ahead 50 percent to
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady stressed that the Clinton administration created
``a stronger, better country than we were in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill, Al, Tipper and I got on that bus after our
convention eight years ago, we saw faces of hope _ but also faces
of despair _ fathers out of work, mothers trapped on welfare,
children with unmet medical needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that while the Clinton adminstration had made
``great progress in the last eight years ... we still still have a
lot of work to do. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``When a child can't go to school without fearing guns and
violence _ that's a child left behind. When a child's illness is
treated too late _ or not at all _ because a hard-working parent
can't afford health insurance _ that's a child left behind. When a
child struggles to learn in an over crowded classroom _ that's a
child left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the first lady appeared at Raleigh Studios
in Hollywood at a reception honoring Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who
bowed out of the Senate race when Mrs. Clinton made it clear she
wanted to run.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon, sponsored in part by the Hollywood studio
DreamWorks SKG was intended for 500, including many female members
of Congress, but several tables were empty.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who arrived 35 minutes late, praised Lowey for
championing abortion rights, fighting to include contraception in
federal health plans and opposing the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be absolutely critical as we work to elect Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman that women know what's at stake in this
election,`` the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the affair included Democratic Reps. Nancy Pelosi,
Anna Eshoo and Lynn Woolsey of California and Carolyn Maloney and
Carolyn McCarthy of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Lazio criticized Mrs. Clinton for holding
fund-raisers at a star-studded concert at a private estate in Los
Angeles and another at Sony Studios that netted more than $1
million in soft money, the unregulated contributions to political
parties that are supposed to be used for getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should return to New York, reveal the special interest
sources of all that money, and join me in banishing it from this
race altogether,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: A REPREHENSIBLE WHALE HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Japanese whalers have killed thousands of whales
in the name of scientific research. But this has merely been a
cover for commercial whaling aimed at satisfying Japanese eating
habits, in defiance of a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling that
Japan itself signed.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is now using the same argument to justify its latest whale
hunt, involving six whaling ships that are in the northwestern
Pacific to hunt minke, Bryde's and sperm whales. The hunt has
stirred outrage among other signatories to the treaty. In recent
days the State Department has threatened to block Japanese imports
under an American law authorizing penalties against any nation that
violates a marine conservation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first time in 13 years that the Japanese have
hunted sperm and Bryde's whales. Though minke whales are relatively
plentiful, sperm and Bryde's whales were nearly wiped out in the
1980s, before they came under the protection of the moratorium.
Japan's actions pose a major threat to their survival. The United
States is justified in invoking the so-called Pelly Amendment,
which authorizes trade sanctions. The rest of the international
community should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese say that the West is culturally arrogant in asking
them to abandon whale meat. But whale meat is not a staple there,
only a luxury food. The Japanese can afford a small culinary
sacrifice to preserve these majestic animals.

MICHAEL S. REYNOLDS, BIOGRAPHER WHOSE CAREER WAS HEMINGWAY, DIES AT
63 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N. Mex., Mo., Texas, N.C.)   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael S. Reynolds, the author of a five-volume biography of
Ernest Hemingway, died on Saturday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He
was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his daughter Dierdre
Shipman.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway's life as a novelist, war correspondent and
adventurer was at least as interesting as his fiction, and he was
an author who helped to create his own legend. Reynolds was noted
for his meticulous scholarship and for his efforts to sort the
autobiographical fact from the fiction in Hemingway's work. He also
wrote in a novelistic style himself, one that emulated Hemingway's.
At times, he seemed to enter Hemingway's mind and to know his most
intimate thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was a biographer who seemed to live not only his own
existence but also his subject's. He spent 25 years writing about
Hemingway, beginning in 1976 with ``Hemingway's First War: The
Making of `A Farewell to Arms,''' published by Princeton University
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he sought to catalog the books that Hemingway read during
his formative years. To do so, Shipman said Monday Reynolds went
``through every inventory of each home that Hemingway had lived in,
every library card the man ever had and his curriculum in high
school.'' That resulted in ``Hemingway's Reading, 1910-1940''
(Princeton University Press, 1981).
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, he wanted to be Hemingway,'' Shipman said. ``He
wanted to be able to write like that. As fate happened, he ended up
married with children and supporting a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Wineapple wrote in The Nation magazine, ``Of all
Hemingway biographers, Reynolds is by far the most indefatigable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Plotkin, the archives specialist in charge of the
Hemingway collection at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston,
called Reynolds' biography of Hemingway ``definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really just an extraordinary scholar and a marvelous
writer who chose to use biography as his avenue of expression,''
Plotkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was born in Kansas City, Mo. His father, Raymond, was a
geologist, and Reynolds once said that among the most important
events of his life was ``growing up the son of a geologist, who
taught me how to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Other influences, he said, were ``flunking calculus in 1956,
which ensured that I would not become an engineer.'' He graduated
from Rice University and received a doctorate from Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 he published the first volume of his Hemingway
biography, ``The Young Hemingway'' (Basil Blackwell). In the book
he described Hemingway's war experience: ``Thrown in among older
men, he was accepted as an equal with the privileges of an officer.
In the cafes and clubs of Milan, he drank the wines, the cognacs
and beers that Oak Park railed against. It had been good. And an
older woman, eight years older, loved him, promised to marry him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds followed that volume with ``Hemingway: The Paris
Years'' (Blackwell, 1989), ``Hemingway: The American Homecoming''
(Blackwell 1992) and ``Hemingway: the 1930's'' (W.W. Norton, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Last year Reynolds published ``Hemingway: The Final Years''
(Norton). He did not add significantly to previous biographies by
Carlos Baker, Kenneth Lynn and Jeffrey Meyers, Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The New York Times, ``yet he sharpens many
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds wrote vividly of Hemingway's mental decline, showing
how his depressions occurred in the middle of the writing of his
books instead of after they were finished. He also described
Hemingway's alcoholism and his dependency on prescription drugs.
And he chronicled his abusive relationship with his fourth wife,
Mary Welsh. On one occasion, Reynolds wrote, Hemingway threw white
wine at her, and on another, he spat at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his biography was the most extensive, and his device
of injecting himself into the biography probably makes it more
lively,'' Patrick Hemingway, the author's son, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. ``But it does have the disadvantage of him
injecting material to a certain extent he has made up. The last
biography had events described as if he were an eyewitness.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his retirement, Reynolds was a professor of English at
North Carolina State University in Raleigh. In addition to Shipman,
who lives in Durham, N.C., he is survived by his wife, the former
Ann Eubanks, whom he married in 1960; another daughter, Shauna
Reynolds of New Orleans; a brother, John, of Bryan, Tex.; a sister,
Mary Hamlin of Texarkana, Tex.; and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was a founder and president of the Hemingway Foundation
and Society, an organization of Hemingway scholars that also
administers the annual Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award for the
best first work of fiction published in the United States. Last
month, he resigned from the presidency because of poor health. ``No
sad songs, please,'' he wrote in a letter to the society. ``As
Ernest told us a long time ago, follow any life far enough and it
will end badly.'' &QL;

CLINTON, OPENING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, DECLARES GORE WILL PROTECT

(Eds: The text of Clinton's speech is available from The New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton savored what he called ``this
moment of unprecedented good fortune'' and, in a nostalgic and
sentimental valedictory Monday night, implored Americans to protect
his achievements by electing Vice President Al Gore to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from Clinton's prepared remarks on the opening night of
the 43rd Democratic National Convention made no mention of Gov.
George W. Bush directly. But Clinton scoffed at the suggestion
raised by the Republican nominee at his convention two weeks ago
that the nation had stumbled into prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident,'' Clinton said, ``that we just coasted along, let's be
clear: America's success was not a matter of chance. It was a
matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides who had reviewed the full text of Clinton's speech said it
contained no allusions to the personal scandals he has weathered;
at an event last week the president said his transgressions should
not tar Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton focused Monday on the high points of his entire
two terms, the longest presidential tenure of a Democrat since
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died in 1945 after 12 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also tried to transfer his popularity among the
Democratic faithful to Gore, who has had a difficult time rousing
his party. Clinton, who has said the election of Gore as his
successor is crucial to protecting his own legacy, said of the vice
president, ``More than anybody else I've ever known in public life,
Al Gore understands the future and how sweeping changes can affect
Americans' daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how he and Gore ``worked closely together'' for eight
years, Clinton offered this testament: ``In the most difficult days
of the last years, when we faced the toughest issues _ of war and
peace, of taking on powerful special interests _ he was always
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton, who is 53, was trying to hand off his party to
Gore, the political production Monday night at the Staples Center
here did not have the end-of-an-era emotions of Ronald Reagan's
farewell to his convention in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife, Hillary, also had a central role Monday night.
And in the text of her speech, she not only commended her husband
and blessed the nomination of Gore but sought to bolster her own
bid for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   After calling on the public to ``continue America's progress''
by electing Gore and his running-mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Mrs.
Clinton turned to her own race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' she said. ``I will always be profoundly grateful
to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years.
Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is: thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   During a year in which Clinton has surrendered the political
stage to his vice president and to his wife _ only grudgingly, his
friends and advisers say _ the event Monday night was a prime-time
reminder of how the president dominates his party as a colossal
political and oratorical force.
</P>
<P>
   And to some delegates, it was a reminder that Gore faces a
daunting challenge in trying to inspire voters as skillfully as
Clinton _ who is widely regarded as the party's most adroit
campaigner since John F. Kennedy, who was nominated at the party's
convention in Los Angeles in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Gore was this: the more powerful that Clinton
was in his speech, the less likely that the vice president could
pull off a climactic acceptance speech on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sadness to this evening,'' said Cheri
Hamilton, a delegate from Kentucky who covered herself in
Clinton-Gore buttons. ``They have been a good team, Clinton and
Gore. Gore will work well with Leiberman. But I'm really going to
miss Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grizzard, a delegate from Florida who wore a Clinton '92
T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said, ``I would vote for
Clinton again if I could but, unfortunately, the Constitution says
I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere on the convention floor were signs reflecting the
crowd's deep affection for the Clintons. A woman, bopping to the
music, a smile plastered to her face, waved a sign that proclaimed,
``Iowa Loves Clinton.'' The same sign could be seen in the Kansas
section, and in Utah, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico _ and elsewhere.
The New York contingent hoisted dozens of ``Hillary'' posters,
waving them madly and passing a few to delegates in the Colorado
section.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Graves, 24, a delegate from Fayettville, Ark., was
particularly moved by Monday night's program because the president
is from her home state. ``This is all very sad,'' she said. ``He
has been ours, and he is leaving office. We are hopeful for Al
Gore, but he just isn't ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for the bittersweet comments of some of the
4,339 delegates is that, given polls showing Gore trailing Bush,
they lack the confidence that Republicans enjoyed at their
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Clinton faced one of the most precarious political
challenges of his career: to offer a stout endorsement of Gore that
will spur Democrats _ and the American public _ to rally around the
vice president. But he also had to take care to leave Gore some
room to declare his independence.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his address, Clinton recounted what he considered
the triumphs of his administration. Invoking the slogan of his
acceptance speech four years ago, he declared, ``My fellow
Americans, tonight we can say with confidence: We built our bridge
to the 21st century. We crossed it together. And we're not going
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the new ticket would build on his foundation,
Clinton said, ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity
going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health
care and in family tax cuts that we can afford. In stark contrast,
the GOP wants to spend every dime of our projected surplus and then
some.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's presence Monday night could not help remind
viewers of the scandals of the Clinton administration that the Bush
campaign is intent on keeping alive. For some Democrats, Clinton's
departure from Los Angeles on Tuesday could not be too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois put it at a news
conference Monday, ``We've got to get Bill Clinton _ and I'm going
to say this quite frankly and quite bluntly _ out of town as
quickly as possible and get to these issues and not make our
convention some referendum on what occurred in the impeachment
process.''

</P>
<P>
   The evening was clearly an emotional crest for Clinton and his
stalwart supporters. Advisers to Clinton said he was choking up as
he rehearsed his lines earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the objective of pumping up Gore for four nights, the
Democrats sought to portray the Republicans as staging a masquerade
of moderation at their convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker stirred up the Democratic faithful by
upbraiding the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans put on quite a spectacle in Philadelphia,''
said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the convention and the
party's most prolific fund-raiser. ``They pretended they were
tolerant. They pretended they were moderates. They pretended they
cared about education, health care and the environment. Let's face
it, they pretended they were Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew cheers when he added, ``Governor Bush sure delivered a
pretty speech. But it reminded me of a Texas longhorn: Two points
with a lot of bull in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California welcomed the delegates to his
state, saying, ``Here in the home of the film industry, we've seen
the previews of the Republicans' movie: `George and Dick's
Excellent Adventure.' I don't think it's gonna make it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andrew Tobias, the Democratic Party's treasurer, said: ``The
Democratic leadership celebrates diversity, not for show _ for
real. They have made my life and the lives of millions of other gay
and lesbian Americans immeasurably better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the opening gavel fell, Gore was campaigning in Missouri,
emphasizing his commitment to Social Security and Medicare. During
a stop at President Harry Truman's hometown of Independence, he
said, ``Harry Truman said, when he started the fight for Medicare,
`We can afford many things, but the one thing we can ill afford is
not to have good health care for our people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That is as true today as it was true back then. I believe we
have to move step by step toward Harry S. Truman's goal of
universal health care for all of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   On this first day, there was not quite the harmony that so
marked the Republican convention. Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California rebuffed an offer to address the delegates, saying she
did not want it to appear as if she had been motivated by
``personal gain'' when, under pressure from the Gore campaign, she
agreed to move a fund-raiser from the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Clintons appeared here, two governors, Jean Shaheen
of New Hampshire and Gary Locke of Washington, struggled to perform
like talk show hosts as they asked individuals to tell how Clinton
administration accomplishments like the Family and Medical Leave
Act and a program to put more police officers on the street had
helped them.
</P>
<P>
   And the proceedings opened with an invocation that must have
been unnerving for the majority of delegates who favor abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In you, oh God, we trust that you will keep us ever committed
to protect the life and well-being of all people, but especially
unborn children,'' Cardinal Roger Mahony, the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Los Angeles, prayed.

SPORTS COLUMN: `THE REPLACEMENTS' AN UPBEAT COMEDY ABOUT THE NFL
STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember scab football? Remember the fun? Those golden moments?
The talent? The dignity?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. The players who replaced striking National
Football League players in 1987 did not distinguish themselves and
faded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Union-busting made lousy football and worse television.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, wash away those dingy old memories and leap into
fantasy with the upbeat new film, ``The Replacements.'' Here,
greedy, boorish union players are replaced during a strike by a
lovable, hungry bunch of lugs from Washington who bond as a unit
while singing ``I Will Survive'' in a jail cell, win the hearts of
a grateful metropolis and beat Dallas to make it to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   (Great film idea: the fuzzy, warm side of thugs working for the
Ford Motor Co. who beat Walter Reuther and other union organizers
in 1937.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' is ``Rudy'' and ``Major League'' rolled
into one anti-union comedy starring Gene Hackman as the coach, who
has now gone from coaching fresh-faced high schoolers in
``Hoosiers'' to leading a team with a convict in some kind of
modern correctional reform: a scab football work-release program.
``They have been part of something great,'' Hackman says at the
end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the NFL refused to sanction ``The
Replacements.'' Its refusal to grant Warner Brothers a license
forced the filmmakers to create team names, like the Washington
Sentinels, and fashion new uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it made sense to remind people of our 1987
strike,'' said Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the league. No doubt
the league would not have been elated to see a replacement player
use a pistol to shoot out the windows of the striking quarterback's
expensive foreign car.
</P>
<P>
   The league's refusal to sanction the film did not keep the
Maryland Stadium Authority from seeking the Baltimore Ravens'
go-ahead to let the producers use PsiNet Stadium. ``We OK'd it
because they felt it would be good for the economy of the
community,'' said Kevin Byrne, a spokesman for the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   (Short historical tidbit: during the 1987 strike, Art Modell,
who owned the Cleveland Browns then and now owns the Ravens, said:
``There are no circumstances under which free agency will work.'')
</P>
<P>
   The NFL Players Association contemplated protesting the making
and opening of the film, but thought better of calling attention to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strike was a dark period for players and to make a comedy
out of it is unfair to its importance in the lives of our
players,'' said Doug Allen, the union's assistant executive
director. ``Anyone who cooperated with this movie perpetuates a
revisionist and unfair view of history that is denigrating to NFL
players who were fighting for the right to choose where they
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Replacements,'' issues are never discussed. But hiring
strippers to be cheerleaders is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' has two familiar faces: Pat Summerall and
John Madden. The Fox announcers called NFL replacement games in
1987 when they worked at CBS, and call the film's games.
</P>
<P>
   Summerall and Madden were contractually bound to call those
real-life strike games, but chose to play along with the charade in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at it as an entertainment,'' said Sandy Montag,
who represents both men. ``They didn't view themselves as an
ex-player and an ex-coach, but as announcers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Summerall seems more himself than Madden, whose
hyperactive style of analysis seems half as fast as usual. When
they see the film, they may be a smidgen surprised to see some of
their game commentary diverted for use as narration for a love
scene. Oops!
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the film, Madden, as Madden, says, ``I never
thought I'd say this, but I'm going to miss those replacement
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I never thought I'd hear him say that either.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dierdorf, a NFL analyst on CBS and a former St. Louis
Cardinals union rep, said he received an early inquiry about being
in the film. He said, ``But the NFL wasn't behind it and I was of
the opinion that it would not be a smart thing to do.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
TERRIFIC `NEWS' BY OLBERMANN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Net's search for a distinctive show is over: the new
Sunday night ``Keith Olbermann Evening News'' is a sophisticated
and occasionally silly vacation from ``SportsCenter'' or the
``National Sports Report.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is Olbermann's innovative circus, where he juggles
essays, field reports and interviews from his retro perch in what
could have been Grantland Rice's office.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he featured a terrific report on the actors' strike
against television commercial production and the decision by Tiger
Woods and Kurt Warner to cross picket lines to star in their own
ads. &QL;

THE BEST PLAYER NOBODY KNOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to interview me?'' Todd Helton asked. ``I'm
not that interesting of a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, came the reply, you're establishing yourself as one of the
best players in baseball. You've led the National League in hitting
for nearly the entire season _ sometimes flirting with the .400
mark _ in only your third full season in the big leagues. You're
leading the league in hits and runs scored, you are among the
leaders in runs batted in and you batted .315 and .320 in your
first two years with the Colorado Rockies _ and most people still
have no idea who you are or where you came from.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you took your wife to a baseball fantasy camp on your
honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that,'' he explained. ``I made a deal with Kristi. She
wanted to go to the Windward Islands in the Caribbean on our
honeymoon. I said OK, but after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who turns 27 on Sunday, has a boyish face and a short
haircut reminiscent of a college student, but he is big and strong
_ 6 feet 2 inches, 205 pounds _ and there is an unmistakable
intensity in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He may also be a more interesting person than he lets on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works his tail off,'' his manager, Buddy Bell, said.
``Never satisfied. And he doesn't take himself too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, perhaps. ``When I first came up to the majors and
I'd have a bad day, I'd punish myself,'' Helton said. ``I would do
something like not eat dinner. Now I've come to appreciate that we
play 162 games a year, and you're going to have bad days. And not
eating dinner hurts, doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton _ who plays first base and entered Monday hitting .392,
best in the major leagues _ is understated in many ways, though
with some wild and wacky yearnings. He wears No. 17, as a tribute
to Mark Grace, the Cubs first baseman and emphatic free spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way Gracie plays,'' Helton said. ``All-out, and
with a full-range game. I also wish I could be like him and not
wear batting gloves, like the old-timers. But I get a better grip
with gloves. And I'd shave my head like he does, if my ears weren't
so big.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Grace and Helton bat and throw left-handed. Each is an
All-Star, Grace three times in his 13-year career, Helton for the
first time this season. When the two players found themselves
together at first base in a recent game, Helton told Grace why he
wore No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flattered,'' Grace said, ``but Todd is going to be a
whole lot better player than I ever was. He's got a great talent
and has a great attitude. He's not like a lot of guys today. When
he hits a home run, he doesn't dance around the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor, the Cubs' manager, who was the Rockies' manager when
Helton came up to the big leagues, said there is more to Helton's
game than what appears in the batter's box, or in the box score,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young guys coming up now just think, `Offense,
offense, offense,''' Baylor said. ``But Todd works at every aspect
of the game, to try to be a complete player. He's not a speedy base
runner, but he's a smart base runner. And in the field, he's
excellent. He's one of the best at coming in on bunts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clint Hurdle, the Rockies' batting coach, said Helton was so
good at coming in on bunts that he could change the complexion of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes teams don't bunt in bunt situations because of
Todd,'' Hurdle said. ``The best I've ever seen at turning a decent
bunt into a double play was Keith Hernandez. And Todd is as good, I
think, or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton seems surprised at the compliments for that aspect of his
game. ``Defense is part of the game, isn't it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard work, right? ``Tarring a highway in 90-degree
heat is hard work,'' he said. ``Playing baseball is not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor wonders if Helton's experience as a quarterback at
Tennessee has helped his ability to field the bunt and throw in one
motion to second or third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' Helton said. ``You have to remember, I wasn't a
very good quarterback.'' He started four games for the Vols in his
junior year, but he injured his knee and was replaced by a freshman
named Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was watching Manning that I realized in a hurry that
football was not in my future,'' he said. ``It was baseball I'd
better stick with.''
</P>
<P>
   While baseball fans around the country are just beginning to
recognize Helton's ability, baseball scouts have known about him
for a long time. Helton, whose father, Jerry, was a minor league
catcher in the Twins organization, was born and raised in
Knoxville, Tenn. He was a pitcher and first baseman at the
University of Tennessee, leading his team to the College World
Series in 1995. He was named Baseball America's College Player of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies selected him in the first round of the 1995 draft,
the eighth pick over all, and three seasons later he replaced the
veteran first baseman Andres Galarraga when he signed as a free
agent with Atlanta. Helton was a close second to Kerry Wood for
National League Rookie of the Year in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his skills in the field and on the bases, it is Helton's
hitting that has most set him apart.
</P>
<P>
   Hurdle told Helton last season that the best hitters maintain
their concentration by never taking their eyes off the pitcher.
Helton has taken the advice a few steps farther. He comes out of
the dugout swinging two bats, and moves close enough to the plate _
about halfway between the on-deck circle and the batter's box _
that a pitcher might wonder if he was suffering double vision, with
two batters challenging him.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the plate, Helton stands in the batter's box in a
relatively straight-up stance, as though getting a chest X-ray. His
bat is held high, considerably above his left ear, and he appears
ready to beat off not just a slider, but a snake as well.
</P>
<P>
   His bat is an unusual reddish color, seemingly reminding the
pitcher that he is in for a serious if not bloodcurdling
undertaking. When the pitch is on the way, Helton raises his right
leg higher than most, as if stepping over a puddle, and then swings
with such fluidity that one may be excused to compare it to music.
The next sound is often a bang, like from a drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a flat-out sweet swing,'' Hurdle said. ``I'm
reminded of Don Mattingly or George Brett.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton said he knew people were impressed with the grace of his
swing. ``But I don't see it,'' he said. ``I watch films and think:
`That could be better. It wasn't as pretty as it felt.' And I watch
films of Brett, and think, `Now that's a beautiful swing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Helton hit for average, he hits for power. He hit
25 home runs in his first year with the Rockies and 35 the next. He
has 27this season, along with 98 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Helton is the cleanup hitter, and thus not expected to bunt.
Many young players are not adept at bunting, and don't try. But can
Helton bunt?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Bell, his manager, ``and we aren't going
to find out.'' The implication was clear. Helton's function is to
batter the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the very next game after Bell's remark, Helton found himself
leading off the top of the ninth inning in Wrigley Field, with the
Rockies trailing Chicago, 2-0. Seeing third baseman Willie Greene
playing deep, Helton tried to lay down a bunt for a hit. He had the
fundamentals right, but the ball rolled foul. He flied out on the
next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my idea to bunt _ it didn't come from the manager,''
Helton said later. ``For a shot to win, we needed a base runner. A
home run wasn't going to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell approved. It was that kind of attitude _ ``maturity beyond
his years'' _ that Bell had talked about, when a player was not
looking to beef up his stats, but to aid the team.
</P>
<P>
   Helton is a different player than he was when he first came up.
Some of it has to do with Hurdle's advice, some of it has to do
with his own ability to live and learn, and labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch a lot of film, keep a diary of pitchers and pitches,
and come out early to take batting practice,'' he said. ``The more
you do it, the more confidence you get. It's an old story, but you
really have to believe in yourself, believe you can do it.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   Helton said that when he first came up, he lacked confidence in
late-game situations. ``When I'd be facing a closer, someone who I
knew threw really hard, I'd think, `I'm not going to hit this
guy,''' he said. ``But I knew my attitude had to change. And slowly
it did. Now I go up thinking, `You'd better not throw a strike.'
Except for Robb Nen. Can't do a thing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also very aggressive in his first year, to his detriment,
once even jumping to hit a pitch that was over his head. ``You
could fool him and get him out with changeups,'' said Kevin Tapani,
the Cubs pitcher. ``No more. Now, you just hope he hits the ball at
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   When Helton arrived as a freshman at Tennessee, he thought about
majoring in veterinary medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in my first day in chemistry class, I knew this was going
to be too time consuming if I was going to play two sports,'' he
said. ``So I switched very quickly to business management.''
</P>
<P>
   Science was not a complete loss for him. In biology lab, he
shared a microscope with another freshman, Kristi Bollman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met looking into a lens together at dissected frogs,''
Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   They were married last Jan. 29, Helton said, and he had
committed to be an instructor in the Rockies' fantasy camp in
Tucson. Spring training was right around the corner, he said, and
he had worked so hard in the off-season to prepare that he did not
want to let it all go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Did it bother him that his wife might have had a different
fantasy for their honeymoon?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's understanding,'' he said, with a hint of the hopeful.
``She's learning what it is to be a baseball wife.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has been learning what it is to be a baseball player _ a
better and better one, that is. On that, surely, Mr. and Mrs.
Helton would agree. &QL;

COMMENTARY: IN LOS ANGELES, MRS. CLINTON IS READY FOR HER CLOSE-UP
</HEADLINE>
  By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The setting for the Clinton rally in Hollywood
Sunday afternoon was more reminiscent of the first couple's
Arkansas past than their New York future. It was the small-town
Main Street created for the Sony Pictures Studio, a place where
Hillary Rodham Clinton slipped somewhat too easily into her old
supporting role as first lady. After more than a year of
establishing her own political identity in New York, with only five
months to go in the Clinton presidency, she was once again doing
her dutiful first lady act, performing a downbeat opening routine
for her highly oratorical husband.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, she gave an earnest, efficient, plain speech to
this Hollywood group before turning over the microphone. True to
form, he made her look like a novice. Still, when the candidate for
the Senate spoke, people listened; as the president spoke, his
audience began to slip away at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   This moment on an ersatz street in the capital of make-believe
underscored one real-life, if largely unspoken, truth about the
couple that have dominated Democratic consciousness for almost a
decade. He has always been the Clinton with the talent to win
people over, to dazzle them with empathy, to make the Hollywood
crowd envy his glamour and open their checkbooks. But this week in
Los Angeles, the party faithful are going through a collective act
of realization. At long last, Hillary has one thing he doesn't _ a
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now comes the time when she has to talk about who she is, what
kind of person she is, what she thinks about issues and what she
would do as senator,'' says Randi Weingarten, president of the
United Federation of Teachers. Like most of Mrs. Clinton's ardent
New York supporters, Weingarten insists that she has full
confidence in the First Lady's abilities to wow her audiences, to
convince them of her solid credentials, her stands on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that Mrs. Clinton is but a few days away from
shedding the first lady role more fully than ever and moving into
the territory of the full-time candidate who will have to rely on
her own talents and resources more than on borrowed charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vice President Al Gore, Mrs. Clinton has to move out more
solidly on her own, holding onto the economic progress in the last
eight years while shedding the sleazier stuff that is clearly a
more complicated part of her life than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend in Hollywood rubbing shoulders with movie stars and
moguls raises money at the same time that it revives the questions
about the Clintons' attraction to glitter and old memories of
Monica Lewinsky's hometown. Back home in New York, Mrs. Clinton's
opponent Rick Lazio was making the connection by holding a press
conference at Planet Hollywood in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Vice President Gore, Mrs. Clinton is enjoying the rush
of support coming from his choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his
running mate. A Democratic candidate in New York State usually
needs about 70 percent of the Jewish vote. Before the Lieberman
choice, only about half of the state's Jewish Democrats were
supporting the first lady. ``It's hard to imagine a more helpful
choice for her,'' said Victor Kovner, a New York City Democratic
Party loyalist who sees the choice as a tie-breaker in this race.
``The Jewish community will come home to their party.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman may also activate the Orthodox vote that is
heavily conservative, Mrs. Clinton seems confident that she will
make a net gain from his presence on the New York ballot. All
weekend, she has used the Lieberman name like a protective mantra,
even letting it be known that she agrees with many of the
Connecticut senator's concerns about too much violence in the
entertainment fare churned out by her big donors here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her assignment to introduce her husband's speech last
night, Mrs. Clinton seemed determined to create a new aura of
independence in Los Angeles _ not only at the fund-raisers but also
in the many media interviews with anchors big-time and small. It
was she, for example, who announced the pullback in the first
couple's interview schedule when it became clear that their efforts
to upstage Gore were turning into a public-relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Her other appearances here were intended to do more than raise
money. She also wanted to make the point that the New York Senate
campaign was a contest on issues _ abortion, the economy, gun
control _ where she fits more easily with the state's majority than
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, then, this convention marks Mrs. Clinton's graduation
from the campaign-worker phase of her life to the politician phase.
That gave a special resonance to the words that she spoke to a
worshipful crowd of Democratic women in a jammed ballroom of the
Wilshire Grand Hotel. ``We are not going back,'' she said. ``we are
not keeping quiet. We are not giving up. We intend to take our
rightful place at the table.'' Mr. Clinton was not in the audience,
but you have to wonder if he checked the transcript. &QL;

 &HT;    KEYNOTE SPEAKER HAS A MESSAGE FOR YOUTH
 &HT;    By MELANIE EVERSLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tuesday night's buzz at the Democratic National
Convention will likely circulate around Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn.,
who may graduate to national newsmaker after delivering the keynote
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who at age 30 is the youngest member of Congress, is the
first African American to offer the keynote to a Democratic
convention since Barbara Jordan in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis legislator said his 15- to 20-minute address will
tout a collection of Gore-Lieberman proposals. He said he will urge
young people to become more involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my generation are involved in non-profits. We're
literally involved with the grass roots. My message is, that's
great, but if you want to get involved on a macro level, you've got
to get involved in electoral politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Issues aside, there are those in Washington who believe Ford
also fulfills the needed glamour factor at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   He is being compared to George P. Bush, the nephew of Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush who wowed audiences during the
GOP national convention two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the worst they can say about me, I'm flattered,''
Ford said. ``And I wouldn't want to insult George P. He's a good
looking guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford shares some traits with the man who asked him to deliver
the keynote, Al Gore: Both come from Tennessee but attended a
prestigious Washington private school. Both entered Congress in
their 20s, following in the footsteps of their famous fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father, the late Albert Gore Sr., served seven terms in
the House and three in the Senate, while Ford directly succeeded
his father, Harold Ford Sr., in the House. The elder Ford served 11
terms and was Tennessee's first black congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, in fact, remembers first meeting Gore when he was 10 years
old. Gore was sitting at his family's kitchen table, talking
politics, and Ford remembers being affected by him.
</P>
<P>
   And Ford also shares a trait with Gore's running mate, Sen. Joe
Lieberman. Like the Connecticut senator, he spoke out about
President Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
In fact, he was ruled out of order on the House floor in 1998 for
saying President Clinton ``lied'' about his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the Democratic Party said Ford, who first
came to Congress at age 26, has already drawn attention by forming
the Congressional Children's Caucus and pushing for public school
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold E. Ford Jr. is a rising star of the Democratic Party,''
Gore said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also is a political role model for young African Americans,
said Mildred Lee Taylor, a Memphis school teacher from attending
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor referred to recent studies that show that a growing
number of young African Americans identify with the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not switching over like a lot of young people. He's not
a selfish person. He cares about people,'' said Taylor, 49, who
lives in Ford's congressional district.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S VALEDICTORY  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 14:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional farewell to the party that he reshaped and led
for eight turbulent years, President Clinton Monday night offered a
passionate defense of his record and a dutiful argument that Vice
President Al Gore is ready to take over. For fans of presidential
oratory, the speech was a reminder of Clinton's skills as an
advocate who can both speak from the heart and argue a case through
a series of logical points. The enthusiastic reception from the
Democrats at the convention was testimony to their mixed feelings _
an eagerness to move beyond Clinton and his outsized personal
problems as well as genuine gratitude for his success in
modernizing Democratic Party ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's valedictory appearance, on the first day of the
convention, was understandably aimed at letting the Democrats dwell
just a little on the past, before sending Gore and his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, into an extremely tough campaign.
Clinton paid tribute to Gore's steadiness under pressure and his
knowledge of government in arguing that the vice president deserved
considerable credit for the successes of the last eight years. He
also portrayed his vice president as the most future-oriented
politician in the country in regard to science, technology and
education issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dealt with his personal scandals by not mentioning them.
He apparently decided that this was not going to be a moment of
contrition or one when the headline writers and Republicans would
have yet another mea culpa with which to work. Instead he dwelt on
his gratitude to the party and to the voters for letting him serve
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in recent interviews, Clinton also made it clear that
Republican convention oratory about an era of accidental and
purposeless prosperity had nettled him mightily. In response to
recent sallies from the GOP nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
Clinton pointed out that when the administration enacted its
economic strategy of trying to close the budget deficit, even by
raising taxes on the richest Americans, the Republican leadership
in Congress voted uniformly against it and predicted it would bring
about economic ruin. Indeed, as the Democrats have tirelessly
pointed out, it was Gore who supplied the tie-breaking vote for the
program in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president's tribute to Lieberman was a reflection of the
connection the new Democratic ticket has with his own political
career. Clinton is the one who chose Gore, who had run an
embarrassing presidential campaign in 1988, to be his vice
president. He noted that he had known the Connecticut senator since
working for his first state legislative campaign while a law
student 30 years ago. And when Clinton reminded the audience of his
own personal journey to the White House from a tough childhood in a
broken home, he seemed to be trying to contrast himself with the
pampered upbringing of Governor Bush, who is seen by many Americans
as a man they can empathize with more than Gore. The problem with
Clinton's personal reflections, of course, was that Gore comes from
a privileged background.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest flashes of irritation from Clinton came
when he defended his administration's record on military and
preparedness issues. At the Philadelphia convention the Republicans
charged relentlessly that American defenses had declined in the
last eight years, ignoring the fact that military budgets had
started to go down under President Bush and have gone back up in
the last several years. Clinton even suggested that the Republicans
were inviting trouble from overseas with their accusations. Any
foreign country inspired by Republican assertions to think that the
United States is not ready to defend itself, he said, would be
making a grave mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the last convention of any two-term president can be
called the end of an era. But there is no doubt that this farewell
will be remembered by every living Democrat as an unforgettable
time. In party terms, Clinton's great accomplishment was to remodel
the liberal policies that let the Democrats dominate midcentury
politics but that became a straitjacket when Ronald Reagan arrived
on the scene. There will always be the sadness that the Clinton
record will forever be blotted because his leadership gifts were
offset by a self-destructive streak at the center of his
personality. For all that, Clinton will go into party history as
the only politician of his decade with a personal magnetism and
communicative skills to match those of Reagan and Clinton's own
boyhood idol, John F. Kennedy.

FOR THE BLUE DOGS, CONVENTION PROVIDES A NIGHT TO HOWL

 Washington Bureau   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The congressional Blue Dogs and hundreds of their
allies were penned up inside an oceanfront amusement park on famous
Santa Monica pier Sunday night, hounded by protesters trying to
disrupt events at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the top dogs in the coalition of Democratic moderates and
conservatives wouldn't turn tail. ``It's the First Amendment,''
said Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., as he surveyed the mob trying to
block the entrance to Pacific Park. ``They've got the right.''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the Blue Dogs could consider it a success that
their celebration was significant enough to attract demonstrators
on the eve of the convention. Started as a small band of mainly
Southern Democrats who felt abandoned by the leadership of their
party, the coalition has grown in stature and is trying to flex its
muscle both at the convention and in the upcoming congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a high-profile part of the activities here in
Los Angeles,'' said Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., co-chairman of the
Blue Dogs, a group that drew its name from a combination of the old
yellow-dog Democrat label and the famous blue-dog artwork of New
Orleans painter George Rodrique.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 members of the Blue Dog coalition consider themselves the
conservative conscience of the House Democratic caucus, pushing for
sound spending practices and working with Republicans when they
feel the GOP has a worthy idea. The group helped broker the deal
that led to the overhaul of the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help bring moderation to both extremes of the party and we
have been successful,'' said Rep. Chris John, D-La., who serves as
co-chairman with Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them differ from their more liberal Democratic
colleagues in another important respect _ they are supporters of
gun rights, a position brought home by the fact that the National
Rifle Association was among the corporate sponsors of Sunday's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, the Second Amendment is pretty sacred in Texas,''
said Rep. Charles Stenholm, a Lone Star lawmaker and early Blue
Dog, making no apologies for the NRA support.
</P>
<P>
   The group's major emphasis at the moment is helping elect
Democrats to Congress this November to recapture the House. After a
close review of Democratic challengers, the group has endorsed and
is financially supporting 13 candidates in Florida, North Carolina,
Texas, Alabama, Michigan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But their intentions are not totally pure. Leaders of the Blue
Dogs know that if the Democrats regain control, it will be by a
very slim margin and the coalition would then control a decisive
30-vote bloc, making them power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wake up on November 8 and we have a majority, we are
going to be in play,'' said Rep. John.
</P>
<P>
   Though they sometimes give Democratic leaders a headache, the
Blue Dogs have friends in high places. ``We have to have their help
to win the majority,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, head of the
House Democratic Caucus and a guest at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's party was an illustration of how far the coalition has
come. The members distributed more than 5,000 tickets to the
extravaganza and it appeared a large percentage of them were used
as party goers packed a stretch of the pier, playing carnival
games, enjoying the rides and dancing to big-name entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the night was obvious from the blue dogs given as
game prizes to the blue decorations to the pitchers of the Blue Dog
Special, a blue-tinged rum drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to howl tonight,'' said Cramer as he took in the
party.
</P>
<P>
   But protesters outside were howling as well about corporate
America, heckling guests as they arrived, tossing coins at them and
jostling with police officers clad in riot gear and mounted police
who used their horses to try to keep the entrance open. Overhead
floated a balloon carrying the message, ``People before profits.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the lawmakers and their guests took the
protests in stride until late in the evening when police
effectively were forced to close the entrance for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from South Louisiana and we don't have protests like that
down there,'' said John. ``It was a little scary when we walked up
but they were exercising their freedom of speech.''
</P>

ALGERIAN ARRAIGNED IN EXPLOSIVES SMUGGLING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mokhtar Haouari, an Algerian charged with helping a
group trying to smuggle explosives into the United States, was
arraigned in Federal District Court in Manhattan Monday afternoon
after arriving from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari, who pleaded not guilty at the arraignment, was arrested
by Canadian police officers in Montreal on Jan. 10 after he was
indicted by a grand jury in New York. After being held in Canada
for several months, Haouari waived extradition proceedings and
agreed to come to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged that Haouari helped another Algerian
citizen, Ahmed Ressam, who has been charged with trying to smuggle
explosives over the Canadian border in the trunk of his car. On
Dec. 14, 1999, Ressam was stopped by customs agents as he crossed
the border by ferry at Port Angeles, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, customs agents found bags of
explosives hidden in the spare tire well of Ressam's car.
Prosecutors said Ressam tried to run from the customs agents, but
they caught him after a brief chase.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari has been charged with being a link between Ressam and
another man charged in the case, Abdel Ghani Meskini. According to
papers filed by prosecutors, electronic surveillance of Meskini's
telephone in New York ``implicates Haouari and Meskini in a plot to
have Meskini meet and assist Ressam in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the papers, in another conversation Meskini said
that both ``Meskini and Mokhtar knew Ressam, that Ressam was part
of a well-organized group and that Mokhtar was part of the same
`network.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the indictment, prosecutors charged that Haouari asked
Meskini to travel to Seattle to help Ressam. Prosecutors also
charged that Haouari provided false identification documents for
members and associates of a terrorist group. Among the documents
listed by prosecutors were United States immigration identification
cards and French and Canadian passports.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings in Canada last July, Haouari's lawyer said his
client wanted to face the charges as soon as possible. The lawyer
said they were confident there was not enough proof to find his
client guilty. At Monday's appearance in Manhattan, Haouari's
lawyer reserved the right to apply for bail later.

METS PITCHING HAS AN OFF NIGHT AND GIANTS WIN IN A ROUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets pitchers had worked 304 innings
since the last time an opponent exploded like the San Francisco
Giants did Monday night. Then the Giants did it two innings in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring five runs in the sixth inning and six runs in the
seventh, the Giants stomped on the Mets, 11-1, bringing an emphatic
end to a series that began with three Mets victories. As helpless
as the Mets were on the mound, they were just as anemic at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Giants right-hander Russ Ortiz was not sharp, throwing 57 balls
to 58 strikes, but he flustered the Mets over seven shutout
innings, allowing only one hit despite six walks. Ortiz was one of
five Giants with multiple runs batted in, and left fielder Barry
Bonds _ 1 for 11 in the series before Monday night _ went 4 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz's first major league start came at Shea Stadium in Aug.
1998, and he has had great success against the Mets ever since. In
five career starts against the Mets, Ortiz is 4-0 with a 2.83
earned run average over 35 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had won 16 of their last 19 games before Monday
night, dropped to two and a half games behind the Atlanta Braves in
the National League East. Rick Reed (7-3), who had started only in
victories since coming off the disabled list in mid-July, allowed
eight hits and five runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The fateful sixth inning was the highest-scoring inning by a
Mets opponent since July 4, when the long-lost Bobby M. Jones
unraveled against the Florida Marlins. Reed matched Ortiz for
shutout innings through the fifth, but a pitcher's duel quickly
became a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Mueller and Bonds singled to lead off the inning, a
Reed fastball tailed too far inside on Jeff Kent, and it hit him,
loading the bases. J.T. Snow drove a sinking liner to center, where
Jay Payton raced in and caught it on a sprint. Payton's momentum
carried him toward the right field foul line, and he threw across
his body to try to catch Mueller tagging up. But the throw was high
and got away from Mike Piazza, the run scored and a runner
advanced, and then a torrent of hits came.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks singled through the left side of the infield for a
run, and Rich Aurilia singled to the same place, also for a run.
Bobby Estalella doubled to the left field corner, and two more runs
came in. It was 5-0, Giants, and for the Mets, the worst was yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook relieved Reed to start the seventh and gave up the
most runs a Met reliever has allowed in a single game all year.
Cook faced eight batters and retired only one. He walked two and
allowed five hits and six runs. The final two came on a single by
Ortiz, who had fanned three times against Reed.
</P>
<P>
   After the first big inning, Ortiz was still working on a
no-hitter. But Mike Bordick led off the sixth with a single through
the left side of the infield, and stole second as pinch-hitter
Darryl Hamilton struck out. Benny Agbayani struck out looking, but
Derek Bell walked and Edgardo Alfonzo got ahead in the count, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Alfonzo swung under a fastball and sent it high in the air
above center field. He bent down and stared at the ground for a
moment, frustrated at the missed opportunity, and trotted toward
first as center fielder Marvin Benard caught it for the
inning-ending out.
</P>
<P>
   That continued a disturbing pattern for the Mets against Ortiz.
They had at least one baserunner in each of the first four innings
but had nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz walked two of the first three hitters he faced, but Piazza
bounced to shortstop to start an inning-ending double play. In the
second, after Robin Ventura drew a leadoff walk, the second baseman
Kent speared Payton's one-out liner, throwing to first to double
off Ventura and end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani walked with two outs in the third and was caught
stealing. Alfonzo walked with one out in the fourth, but Piazza
grounded to Ortiz, who threw to second to start another
inning-ending double play.

FLIGHT 800 REPORT TO SHOW NO EXACT CAUSE
</HEADLINE>
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years after Trans World Airlines Flight 800
exploded off the coast of Long Island, the National Transportation
Safety Board is preparing to approve an unusual final report on the
crash, one that will identify only the penultimate cause.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is working on a 700-page report, far longer than
typical for a major crash, that investigators say contains unusual
detail, documenting an ambitious foray into basic science.
</P>
<P>
   But the report does not tell what the public most wants to know:
the source of ignition for the explosion in the center fuel tank,
when the Boeing 747 was about 11 minutes out of Kennedy
International Airport on its way to Paris on July 17, 1996. As the
plane climbed to 13,700 feet the fuel tank explosion ripped it
apart, chopping off the front of the plane as if with a guillotine.
All 230 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has been mammoth. Searchers retrieved 95
percent of the 170-ton aircraft from the ocean floor and
reconstructed a 90-foot-long section. ``It's the most intensely
investigated accident in aviation history,'' said Beth Erickson,
director of aircraft certification at the Federal Aviation
Administration, which has been deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
   Even with no certainty about the source of ignition, the
accident has set off a wide review of airplane design and operating
practices. That review found troubling conditions on several
varieties of jets, which fly about 30 percent of the time with an
atmosphere in their center tanks that will support combustion. The
findings seem likely to result in major changes, aviation
regulators say, that will reduce the amount of time that fuel tanks
have an atmosphere that will support fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   After analysis of the damage and the pattern in which debris
fell convinced researchers that the cause was the explosion of the
center fuel tank, they desperately tried to figure out where in the
tank the blast originated. They built a quarter-scale model of the
tank, complete with baffles and girders, and filled it with propane
gas. Then they tried igniting the gas from various parts of the
tank to see whether they could create a pressure wave like the one
they deduced, from the damage pattern, must have occurred on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   They could not. ``There were just too many variables,'' one
investigator said. Some people involved said that effort was doomed
from the start, and that it needlessly delayed the safety board's
effort to reach a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The board spent months on other possibilities. One was that a
pipe inside the tank, filled with fuel under pressure, sprang a
leak and created a spray, which built up a static charge. But the
investigators did not find evidence of a failure of the parts that
prevent static buildup.
</P>
<P>
   A scavenge pump that sucks out the last dregs of fuel from the
center tank remains a suspect, even though it is designed to avoid
introducing a spark; it was never found. Likewise, suspect parts of
the fuel quantity indicating system are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also delved deep into fuel chemistry,
including how sulfur in the fuel can combine with copper or silver
from wiring to form deposits on electrical connectors that can
cause short circuits and sparks. And they have conducted
experiments with an airplane in flight to measure the amount of
time that the air space above the fuel in a tank has air and fuel
vapors in a proportion that will allow combustion.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety experts are saying that the work to identify a
variety of potential problems and to make improvements in many
systems will be more vital to safety than finding the one cause of
the Flight 800 explosion. ``How important is it whether it was the
fuel gauge wiring, the scavenge pump or some other wiring?'' one
former board official asked. ``If we knew it was one, would we
exclude the other two? No.''
</P>
<P>
   An investigator still with the board said fixing one specific
source of ignition would not do enough to prevent future
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole drift of our work now is that this is the wrong tack
to take,'' he said. ``Even if we found five or six ignition
sources, there could be more; we've got to go toward making the
tank less explosive. When this is done, we will have extracted the
safety value from this crash.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Boeing Co., officials also said that failure to zero in
on one cause was not a detriment to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thrown a blanket over everything,'' said Ron
Hinderberger, the director of airplane safety at Boeing's
Commercial Airplanes Group unit, ``and we've found other
opportunities in the design, other opportunities in the
maintenance, to enhance the safety of the fuel system.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is different for another reason: It is concerned not
only with what caused the crash, but also what didn't. It dwells
heavily on ruling out a bomb or missile, both subjects of fevered
speculation in the weeks following the crash.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to create an airtight case for a
mechanical failure, the Pentagon test-fired Stinger missiles off
the coast of Florida so investigators could see exactly what those
would look like from shore, to compare the results with witness
reports. Boeing has told the board that there was no evidence of a
bomb or missile damage.
</P>
<P>
   The board is scheduled to meet on Aug. 22 and 23, in a new
multimedia hearing room built partly in anticipation of this event,
to discuss the staff report on the crash, probably haggle over some
details and then approve it and make some additional
recommendations. Those may include advice to the FAA and aircraft
manufacturers, notably Boeing, to review the design of their jets,
people familiar with the report said. The board plans to broadcast
the meeting live on its Web site, www.ntsb.gov, and will post the
report there in a few months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even if no ultimate cause is determined, the report, combined
with recommendations that the safety board issued in April 1998 and
actions recommended by Boeing or ordered by the FAA, are a sort of
a cure, aviation experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions we've taken are the most sweeping and
unprecedented, and broadest in scope, that we've ever engaged in at
the FAA,'' Erickson said. Her agency has issued 37 directives to
aircraft operators, and is developing three more. One requires a
flame arrestor on the scavenge pump. Other orders focus on wiring
changes in the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has recommended that airplanes sitting for long periods
on hot days use portable carts that pump cool air instead of their
air-conditioners, which are next to the center tanks.
</P>
<P>
   A more ambitious idea, injecting nitrogen gas into the tanks
when the planes are on the ground, to reduce the amount of oxygen,
is under development.  &QL;

RISING WATERS, AND SINKING HEARTS, IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BYRAM TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Elena Lazzaro and her husband were the
first to build a home on their block of River Road, on the banks of
the Musconetcong River, 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Lazzaro was one of the last in her now well-developed
neighborhood to pack up a few precious belongings and abandon her
home, after police and fire officials went through the neighborhood
with bullhorns, warning residents that the river waters were
continuing to rise two days after a relentless storm flooded Byram
Township and many other towns in northwestern New Jersey, dropping
14 inches of rain in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to put a chair out here and sit and watch the river,''
said Lazzaro, who has been a widow for two years. The river, once
ankle-deep, was a raging torrent Monday, about six feet deep, and
was beginning to engulf her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lakes and the rivers are what make this area so
beautiful,'' said Lazzaro, standing in the steady drizzle. ``But I
guess it's also what's making it so dangerous now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as some families were allowed to return to their homes
Monday after Saturday's storm, rescue officials evacuated about 300
more families from Byram Township, Sparta and other nearby towns,
including a day camp here with 800 children, because about six dams
in the complex regional system of waterways had given way, swelling
rivers and streams that crisscross the lush terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A storm that dropped four more inches of rain Monday, and the
forecast of more showers for Tuesday, cast a broad swath of
northwestern New Jersey into soggy despair, almost a year after
Tropical Storm Floyd struck central New Jersey and left
record-setting flooding in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gov. Christie Whitman put Morris and Sussex Counties
under a state of emergency, allowing the state to order evacuations
and activate New Jersey National Guard units. Parts of Warren
County were also inundated.
</P>
<P>
   The state has asked for the affected areas to be designated
federal disaster areas, which would make homeowners eligible for
aid. The governor said that designation was important because the
state's disaster fund has been depleted since last fall's tropical
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there's not a lot of state money available,''
she said, ``because we're still providing money for victims of
Hurricane Floyd.''
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries have been reported since Saturday's
downpour, although the torrents damaged hundreds of homes,
destroyed water mains in Newton and collapsed dozens of bridges,
roads and dams.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Trenton Monday morning, Whitman, who
toured the flooded areas by helicopter and on the ground, said the
worst damage was confined to a relatively small area. ``The
fascinating thing about it,'' she said, ``is how really
concentrated it was. You're up there and you have one town that got
14.2 inches of rain, and Andover, the next town over, got an inch
and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the hard-hit areas were reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there are lots of businesses that
have been impacted,'' she said. ``Some homes were shifted off of
their foundations by the pressure of rocks, logs and mud up against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimated that the storm caused $160 million
worth of damage, but said it was too early for a final tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the waters recede in all those lakes and rivers, we
won't know the full extent of what we're dealing with,'' said Eskil
(Skip) Danielson, emergency management coordinator for Sussex
County.
</P>
<P>
   Many people had tales of near-misses with the fast-moving
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Vogel-Short, who lives with her husband near Lake
Hopatcong in a house that was a summer home for his family for 44
years, said they called 911 on Saturday to ask for help when the
lake waters were lapping at their home and threatening to topple
their propane tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us that they had too many calls and they couldn't
come and help unless someone was dying,'' Vogel-Short said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a neighbor's rock wall was directing the flood waters
into her yard. When that neighbor would not allow the wall to be
breached, other neighbors helped dig a trench to divert the water,
and then built a stone barrier around the house and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we were colonists or settlers,'' Vogel-Short said.
``We dug with our bare hands.'' She wound up with four feet of
water in the basement and, like many of her neighbors, had no flood
insurance to pay for the cleanup. ``We were afraid we were going to
lose our homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those evacuated Monday were 800 children at the Jefferson
Lake day camp on Waterloo Road here. Officials said they feared
that eroding dams would cause the Musconetcong River to overflow.
The river, which flows out of Sussex County and borders Morris,
Hunterdon and Warren Counties, was rising a foot an hour Monday,
and crested in midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When emergency workers ordered everyone in the area to leave,
camp officials quickly arranged to have the children bused to a
middle school near the Byram Township municipal building. Late in
the afternoon, with military precision, camp counselors and
directors were getting the children, who did not seem the worse for
wear, back on buses to return them home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't flooded,'' said Ira Fish, the owner of the camp.
``The problem was the road nearby. If that had flooded, we'd have
had to sleep everybody at the camp. We've been here 43 years, and
this has never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the region, residents returned to their homes
Monday. Ron Earl, 66, stood on his son Randy's property on Glen
View Avenue in Sparta, still staring in disbelief at the way the
storm had scraped the property like a giant bulldozer, erasing its
well-tended lawns, two fish-stocked ponds and a gazebo. What
remained was a muddy field, with huge trees upturned, and remnants
of a stone wall that Randy and his grandfather had built over
several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Earl, who was the football coach at Sparta High School until he
retired a few years ago, said that in the late afternoon on
Saturday, it appeared that the flood waters would overtake his
son's house. But before that happened, falling trees created a sort
of dam, diverting the waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll never be able to rebuild it to the way it was,'' said
Earl, who lives across the street from his son and spent the
weekend hauling debris, worrying about how far the river would rise
and marveling at flooding he had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize the power of water,'' he said.

IN PRODUCT SAFETY PROBES, PUBLIC OFTEN LAST TO KNOW &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the Firestone tire recall sparked a national
debate on consumer safety, the recall Monday of 91,000 Go-Karts,
like hundreds of other products each year blamed for deaths, will
pass with little fanfare and even less public outrage, consumer
advocates contend.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old Idaho girl whose neck was fractured when her
hair got caught in the drive chain and sprocket of a Go-Kart is
just one of the estimated 22,000 people killed each year by
hazardous or defective consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 million Americans, about 1 in 10, are injured each
year by items ranging from toasters to aquarium lights, toddler
beds to dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to safety advocates are the federal regulations
forbidding the public from knowing which products are under
investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission -- until a
recall is announced weeks or even months after complaints are first
lodged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers who take the trouble to ask the question are going
to lose interest if they have to wait all this time to find out if
it's safe or not,'' said Mary Ellen Fise, general counsel for the
Consumer Federation of America in Washington. ``They might end up
buying or using a product that is unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were heightened further by the recall last week
of 6.5 million Bridgestone/Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. says Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. began
receiving complaints in 1997 about defective tires believed
responsible for hundreds of crashes and at least 46 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A Firestone representative said the company learned of the
problem only last summer and issued a voluntary recall at the
earliest available opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Delays and secrecy in the recall of consumer products are
inexcusable, Fise said, because many times the unsafe items are
used by or for children, as was the case in 70 of the 140 products
recalled by the safety commission since August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In June alone, 475,000 teething rings were recalled because they
could cause choking and 8.9 million flying dolls were called back
because they could ``fly in unpredictable directions,'' injuring
kids and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Safety commission spokesman Ken Giles declined to say how long
it took to investigate these or other products before they were
pulled from shelves and the public was notified.
</P>
<P>
   Giles said it would be unfair to prematurely worry the public or
damage a company's reputation until tests prove a product is
dangerous and the manufacturer can respond with repairs and work
out details of a recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, Congress felt we should not simply be naming brand
name products unless we had already worked out with the companies
that we were about to release the information or had negotiated
some sort of remedy,'' said Giles, whose agency has jurisdiction
over 15,000 categories of products used in and around the home.
</P>
<P>
   Most investigations do not result in a recall, Giles said. The
200 or so recalls made each year are culled from about 4,000
complaints to the agency's toll-free consumer hotline
(800-638-2772) and thousands of e-mails to its Web site
(www.cpsc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, manufacturers discover and report a defect or
danger to the CPSC, as they are required to do by federal law,
before consumers complain. It is very rare for a company to contest
a recall, so most are voluntary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When a recall is needed, every effort is made to warn customers
either directly through product registration information or
announcements to the general public, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumer advocates say that is not enough since few home
products offer registration and recall notices are easy to miss
unless someone happens across them in media stories or ads, posters
in aisles and checkout lines or other general messages.
</P>
<P>
   Few recalls generate publicity on the scale of the Firestone
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have no interest in drawing out or impeding the
recall process, said Michael A. Brown, a Washington, D.C., attorney
specializing in product safety and recall cases for product makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner they can find out there's a problem the happier
they are, because the longer something goes on the more exposure
there is,'' Brown said. ``And in these days of fickle consumer
satisfaction, if the consumer isn't happy with it you may not get
their business again.''
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, manufacturers welcome the safety commission's
efforts making it easier for complaints to be made over the phone
or Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And while companies want to keep the investigation period
confidential, in part to protect trade secrets, they often request
``fast track'' processing of recalls to avoid accusations of
stalling and putting the public at further risk, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Until about three years ago, manufacturers were somewhat
hesitant to raise a suspected safety issue because that would
almost assuredly launch a CPSC investigation into whether the
problem existed.
</P>
<P>
   It would then take about three to four months before the public
would learn of a defect or hazard, compared with as little as 20
working days under ``fast track,'' in which the company
acknowledges the problem up front and begins immediately to work
with federal regulators on a solution, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of recalls over the past year from the Consumer
Product Safety Commission:
</P>
<P>
   --752,000 gun locks that can separate into two halves, unlocking
the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   --700,000 doll feeding sets with snaps on doll bib that can
detach, causing choking.
</P>
<P>
   --1.8 million latex pacifiers that age faster than normal,
causing the nipple to detach and choke children.
</P>
<P>
   --136,000 cans of fire and smoke suppressant that does not
suppress fire and can intensify it.
</P>
<P>
   --837,000 toy cars with tires that can detach, causing choking.
</P>
<P>
   --103,000 spinning ride toys with a center column that can
break, causing the child to suddenly fall back and get hit in the
face by the column.
</P>
<P>
   --7,500 hedge trimmers with leaking fuel tank vents that pose a
fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   --19,000 mountain bikes with front suspension forks not properly
welded that can break during use, causing serious injury.

  GULF COAST UNFAZED BY BERYL'S APPROACH 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    HARLINGEN _ Tropical Storm Beryl quickened its pace toward the
<TEXT>
Gulf Coast shore Monday, but many residents, mindful of last year's
weak pass by Hurricane Bret, seemed unconcerned.
<P>
   Instead, they watched Beryl's development, planned to weather
the storm at home and hoped it would mean a needed soaking of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hurricane Bret, a powerful Category 4 storm, barreled
through the open ranch country of South Texas, doing little harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's left yet and nobody is talking about leaving,'' said
Matt Moreau, owner of Pico Ace Hardware on South Padre Island.
``Most people are laughing about it and being cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Weather Service predicted that Beryl's
effect on the Houston area would be limited to widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms ending Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a quarter of an inch (of rain), consider yourself
lucky,'' said weather service meteorologist Kent Prochazka.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl was declared a tropical storm Monday when its sustained
winds reached 40 mph. It could reach hurricane strength _
consistent winds of at least 75 mph _ before blowing ashore Tuesday
somewhere near the U.S.-Mexico border, said James Franklin at the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl was centered about 135 miles south-southwest of
Brownsville and was moving northwest at 8 mph. Meteorologists said
if it continued at that pace, it might not have time to grow into a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. government issued a hurricane warning for a
100-mile stretch from Baffin Bay, just south of Corpus Christi, to
the Mexican border. The Mexican government issued a hurricane
warning from the border south to La Pesca, a stretch of about 130
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, few South Padre Island residents purchased
plywood sheets and flashlight batteries. People were confident the
storm would follow weather service predictions and hit land south
of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm passes to the south, residents of the Rio Grande
Valley would see strong winds and get a much-needed drenching of 5
inches to 10 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not boarding up windows or advising evacuation, and
we're not planning to do that,'' said Ray Kendall, South Padre
Island city manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through our countdown: closing off the low access
points to the beach so the water won't flood the streets; moving
trash barrels back to vegetation line; trying to get people to move
their umbrellas off the beach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County's two beachfront parks on South Padre Island were
closed Monday as crews boarded up facilities facing the Gulf. An
evacuation of mobile homes at Isla Blanca Park also was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a steady stream of shrimp trawlers moved through the
Brazos Santiago Pass on their way to Port Isabel, cutting short
fishing trips into the roiling Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
   At the island's U.S. Coast Guard station, three rescue boats
were hauled out of the water and a 41-foot patrol boat was moved
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Mike Watson said the station was preparing for an
intense tropical storm _ with a storm surge and high winds _ but
not a major hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, everything is calm,'' Watson said. The turmoil at sea
was good news for some: Near the island's southern jetties, eager
surfers lined the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay out there 'til I get washed back in,'' said
Houston surfer Aaron Lloyd, watching the waves hiss to shore. ``We
always come down here for the hurricanes _ it's the only good surf
all summer.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, IN CONVENTION FAREWELL, DECLARES GORE HIS HEIR
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton, occupying political center
stage for perhaps the last time, Monday night declared Al Gore the
rightful heir to a ``more confident, hopeful and just'' America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton basked in a curtain call unseen at a Democratic National
Convention in more than half a century. He is the first Democrat
since Franklin Roosevelt to serve two terms as president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the personal shortcomings that tainted his presidency,
Clinton electrified the nearly 5,000 delegates who jammed the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton led the charge in that effort with a television speech _
delivered most after prime time in the East _ that sought to rebut
the claims made by Republican nominee George W. Bush that his
administration had ``coasted'' through the unprecedented economic
prosperity of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is more confident, hopeful and just, more secure and
free, because we offered a vision and worked together to achieve
it,'' he said. ``My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with
confidence: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed it
together. And we're not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the U.S. Senate in
New York, introduced her husband and, like him, promoted Gore and
his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   She did not mention Clinton's impeachment following his
extramarital affair with a former White House intern, but did thank
the delegates for their support ``in good times and in bad'' during
her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And introduced to the strains of ``New York, New York,'' she
reminded the delegates of her Senate race as she vowed to continue
the work she began years ago with the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe it takes a village,'' she said, referring to
her book that was ridiculed at the 1992 GOP convention for its
promotion of children's rights. ``And it certainly takes Al Gore
and Joseph Lieberman. They have what it takes. And they'll do what
it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending his own political legacy, Clinton also promoted his
vice president's candidacy. He called Gore ``a profoundly good
man'' and said he was ``always there'' as he faced issues of war
and peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else I've ever known in public life, Al Gore
understands the future and how sweeping changes can affect
Americans' daily lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore and Lieberman will ``keep our prosperity
going'' in contrast to a Republican administration that would
``spend every dime of our projected surplus'' on tax cuts rather
than on education, Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has consistently trailed Bush in public opinion
polls, the Democratic convention opened with unusually high
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's evening session began with a brief video clip of
President John F. Kennedy, nominated here in 1960. As his
distinctive voice echoed eerily through the Staples Center, a
sustained cheer erupted from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gov. Gray Davis of California recalled how the
Democrats had ``passed the torch'' to a new generation in 1960 and
that it was now time to ``pass that flame'' to Gore, the party's
first presidential nominee of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's program was largely designed as a passing of the torch
from Clinton to Gore, who _ not by accident _ was campaigning in
Independence, Mo., the home of Harry Truman, who also had to labor
to escape the shadow of a larger-than-life president, Franklin
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``one of the best decisions of my life'' was
``asking Al Gore to be my partner'' in 1992. He reminded the
delegates that his administration's economic program passed
Congress with Gore's tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grew nostalgic toward the end of his address, noting how
America had given him a chance ``to live my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to give you a better chance to live yours,'' he
added. ``Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the
same optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years
ago, my heart is filled with gratitude. My fellow Americans, the
future of our country is in your hands. You must think hard, feel
deeply, and choose wisely. Remember, keep putting people first.
Keep building those bridges. And don't stop thinking about
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia
was noted for its political harmony, the Democratic convention
began with some jarring notes in the ``Prosperity and Progress''
theme:
</P>
<P>
   _ Monday night's finale following Clinton's speech featured the
Broadway cast of ``The Music Man'' performing ``76 Trombones.'' The
play is about a slick traveling salesman who pretends to be a band
leader in order to con working families to buy musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the party luminaries, Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California, declined an opportunity to address the convention on
opening night after bowing to pressure and moving a fund-raiser
from the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hundreds of environmental activists tied up the intersections
around the Staples Center with a protest of the Gore family's long
ties to Occidental Petroleum Corp. A trust fund established for
Gore's mother by his late father includes between $500,000 and $1
million worth of Occidental stock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Catholic Cardinal Roger Mahoney, in his invocation, took issue
with the Democratic Party's platform support for abortion rights.
``In you, oh God, we trust ... that you will keep us ever committed
to protect the life and well-being of all people, but especially
unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The evening ``talk show'' format featuring average Americans
who had benefited from the economic prosperity of the last eight
years developed some technical difficulties, and the attention of
many delegates in the convention hall drifted away. Most of the
television networks skipped it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But the enthusiasm in the convention hall returned when former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were introduced
before the airing a video tribute to the only living Democratic
ex-president, and one who is widely admired for his personal
character.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute to Carter was Gore's idea after viewing tributes to
former GOP presidents at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   And a series of women speakers sent scores of demonstrators to
the floor, waving placards that read: ``When Women Vote, Women
Win.'' The speakers included six women from the U.S. Senate: Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California, Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland, Patty Murray of Washington, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana
and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The prominent role of women Monday night underscored the
importance of women voters in this election. Gore and Bush
strategists view them as crucial and thus far, Bush is running
close to Gore among women, wiping out the gender gap that helped
elect Clinton in 1992 and 1996.

PEACE LARGELY PREVAILS IN A LONG DAY OF CONFRONTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Updates and subs lede and 10th graf, That was ..., to correct
number of arrested to nine, sted 10.)

   LOS ANGELES _ The long-awaited dance between protesters and the
police began here in earnest Monday, with speeches, rallies,
singing, marches and a couple of tense standoffs as demonstrators
tried to block traffic downtown near the Staples Center and
officers, present in overwhlming numbers, arrested nine people for
refusing to move.
</P>
<P>
   Under hot, smoggy skies, knots of hundreds of marchers plied
their way back and forth between the site of the Democratic
National Convention and Pershing Square, a broad public plaza about
a dozen blocks away, protesting everything from Vice President Al
Gore's investments in an oil company that plans to drill near a
Colombian Indian reserve to the influence of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The official theme of the day was ``Human Need, Not Corporate
Greed,'' but the placards, banners, puppets and armbands that
swirled through the usually sterile streets of downtown Los Angeles
embraced a dizzying range of causes and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is Not a Commodity,'' read one banner. Another said, ``Al
Gore (EQ) Corporate Eichmann.'' Some demonstrators wore navy blue
T-shirts with the familiar logotype of the Gap clothing stores,
spelling out a rhyming vulgarism for excrement. Perhaps the
bleakest placard: ``All Government is Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was one of mostly placid if wary encounters between
marchers and the police, who seemed to materialize from everywhere
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   This evening, a protest concert by the hip-hop metal band ``Rage
Against the Machine'' began peacefully just outside the Staples
Center in a fenced-off spot from which the authorities had
initially tried to bar demonstrators until a federal judge
intervened. City officials and the police had wor- ried that the
concert posed the most complex challenge of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The morning began with a rally in Pershing Square featuring the
singer Bonnie Raitt to protest Gore's family holdings in the
Occidental Petroleum Corp., which has rights to conduct exploratory
drilling a few miles outside the legal boundaries of the U'wa
Indian reserve in Colombia. Environmental groups have urged Gore to
divest his family of the stock, worth some $500,000, which had been
owned by his father Albert Gore Sr., who died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the only drug coming out of Colombia
is oil,'' said Raitt, who with John Densmore, the former drummer
for the rock band The Doors, sang the old Buffalo Springfield song,
``For What It's Worth.'' The crowd then headed to the Staples
Center, where it greeted some early arriving delegates, including
Keiffer J. Mitchell Jr., a city councilman from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in early just to walk around and see what it's all
about,'' Mitchell said. ``The Democratic Party and the Republican
Party may not address everything, but this shows that here in the
United States of America we can speak out on any issue without fear
of retaliation or harm.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not how some protesters viewed reality just a few
moments later, after they turned back toward Pershing Square and
sought to block traffic at the intersection of Sixth and Flower
streets. After ignoring bullhorn warnings to disperse, nine
demonstrators were arrested and taken jail, said a police
spokesman, Officer Mario Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The police drove the remaining demonstrators back to Pershing
Square, where perhaps 2,000 people were gathered and still more
rallies were scheduled. Just as the group reached the southwestern
corner of the square, there was another tense few minutes as
demonstrators again stood in the middle of an intersection
adjoining the grand old Biltmore Hotel, where top Democrats and
aides to Gore were staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been declared an unlawful assembly,'' the police
commander on the scene warned through a loudspeaker, his voice
barely audible over the din of police helicopters circling
overhead, as officers brandished tear-gas guns. ``We need to clear
the intersection.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, demonstrators, with dueling bullhorns of their own,
answered back with shouted passages from the Constitution and the
First Amendment, including ``the right of the people to peacefully
assemble shall not be abridged.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the protesters retreated and traffic began flowing
again.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Villa, a 25-year-old pre-school teacher from Berkeley,
who came for the protests, looked at the police in disgust. ``These
guys are a brutal force to the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the police seemed bent on restraint, even though they
brooked no interference, pushing back journalists along with
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Even as much of life went on as normal here, the storefronts of
the adjoining jewelry district were deserted and shuttered with
metal grates backed by plywood, and office workers were forced to
take long routes around the block to get back to their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of traffic jams proved a boon for at least one band of
entrepreneurs, the riders of ABC Bike Cabs of Santa Barbara, who
brought a fleet of bicycle surreys to town and drove up and down
downtown streets looking for fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here for the duration,'' said one driver, Alt Olmos, as
he swigged from a water-bottle in the midday sun.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A Russian submarine plunged to the seabed in the
Barents Sea on Sunday during a naval exercise, possibly after an
explosion on board, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the submarine was badly damaged, and was trapped at
least 450 feet below the surface. They said they did not know how
many of the more than 100 crew members on board were alive or how
long they could survive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the navy began preparing a desperate attempt to
rescue the crew. But navy officials said the odds of saving the men
were slim.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, called the Kursk, was not carrying nuclear
weapons, the navy said, but was powered by two nuclear reactors,
raising concerns about possible radioactive contamination. But
Russian officials said the reactors had been turned off, and
officials in Norway said a scientific vessel in the area had
detected no signs of a radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   A flotilla of ships and rescue vessels was on the scene off
Russia's northern coast in rough weather Monday night, frantically
searching for ways to reach the men. Navy officials said they
intended to mount a rescue attempt on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said rescue workers had been trying to hook lines
to the submarine to bring it air and fuel. If the sub lost power,
the men could suffocate and the submarine's compartments could turn
unbearably cold in the frigid waters.
</P>
<P>
   The navy's commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said, ``Despite
all the efforts being taken, the probability of a successful
outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that President
Clinton had been briefed about the accident, and that his national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, had told Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov that the United States was willing to help. Lockhart said
the Russians had not followed up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians initially said the sub appeared to have sunk after
a collision, possibly with a foreign submarine. During the Cold
War, one or two U.S. subs were always on reconnaissance missions in
the Barents Sea. But those missions have become much rarer since
the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and Pentagon officials denied
Monday that any U.S. sub had been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said a Navy electronic surveillance ship was
operating in or near the Barents Sea at the time of the accident.
They said the ship was monitoring Russian submarine movements but
was far from the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Russian submarines, U.S. naval experts said, the
Kursk apparently was not equipped with pressurized escape chambers
that could have carried the crew to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   One military expert, A.D. Baker III, said Russia's Northern
Fleet once had deep-diving minisubs that could have undertaken such
a rescue, just as the U.S. Navy does. But, he said, that ability
was ``allowed to dwindle away'' during budget cuts that have turned
the once-powerful Russian navy into a shadow of what it was during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was doubtful that U.S. rescue vessels could be
brought to the site of the stricken submarine in time, adding that
the Russian crew members would probably be lost ``unless a miracle
occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequent television news updates galvanized viewers in Moscow
and stood in sharp contrast to the secrecy that surrounded
submarine operations during most of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. experts say Russia lost at least four nuclear submarines in
accidents from the 1960s through 1989, while others were crippled
by reactor malfunctions, fires or other problems. U.S. and Russian
submarines used to track one another at close quarters, seeking
information and advantage in a dangerous effort to control the
ocean depths.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Cold War ended, the Russian submarine force has
stayed close to home, cut in size by a third. It has had little
money for training and maintenance, and many of its submarines and
ships are rusting at their piers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy provided few details of the Kursk accident, and
the information available in Moscow Monday was sketchy and even
contradictory. One news report said crew members could be heard
pounding on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   If the submarine still had battery power to run air-cleansing
equipment, crew members who survived the sinking might be able to
live for several more days, said Thomas Nilsen, a researcher in
Oslo and co-author of a report on the Russian fleet. But even if
the air was still breathable, the carbon dioxide exhaled by any
survivors could gradually make the air toxic.

</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, an Oscar II-class submarine that was completed in
1994, sank on Sunday in international waters, about 35 miles from
the coast. Besides torpedoes, it normally carries 24 missiles
intended to destroy ships. It usually has a crew of 107 men, though
some reports said 116 were on this cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the Kursk had been taking part in a naval
exercise when it lost radio contact with its base.
</P>
<P>
   The Itar-Tass news agency reported that a preliminary underwater
investigation showed that an explosion had probably damaged the bow
of the submarine, causing the torpedo room to flood.
</P>
<P>
   The grim efforts to reach the men illustrate the difficult
calculus behind any submarine rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   The United States lost two nuclear submarines, the Thresher and
the Scorpion, in accidents during the 1960s. After the Thresher
sank in 1963, the Navy built two minisubs that can dive to 2,000
feet, connect their hatches to those of stricken subs and ferry 24
men at a time to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The minisubs can be flown to a port near a submarine disaster
and then ferried to the scene by one of eight specially configured
mother submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Navy's minisubs are in San Diego. One of them, the
Avalon, is ready for immediate deployment; the other, the Mystic,
is being certified for a return to activity.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said it was not clear whether either vessel would be
compatible with the hatch design of the Russian sub. And it could
take a week or more for one of the mother submarines to reach
Russian waters.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the editor of Combat Fleets of the World, published by
the U.S. Naval Institute Press, said Russia's Northern Fleet had a
similar mother sub with smaller rescue vessels. But he said those
vessels had not operated since 1990 and were no longer usable.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Russia's best hope for rescuing any sailors on the
Kursk would probably be through the use of pressurized diving
bells, either from its own fleet or borrowed from oil-drilling
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, 32 men were rescued from a primitive U.S.
sub, the Squalus, in four trips with a diving bell in 240 feet of
water. But Baker said the water in the Barents Sea was much more
treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   And some reports said the Kursk had listed nearly 60 degrees to
one side, which could make it hard to secure a diving bell to one
of its hatches.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accident comes at a critical time for Russia's navy,
which has been under strict budget constraints since the fall of
the Soviet Union. As recently as May, the navy owed officers as
much as six months of back wages, while even the temperatures in
schools at the naval bases plunged last winter because of lack of
money for heating.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's record in nuclear safety has also been troubling, with
some areas of the Barents Sea contaminated with radiation from
discarded nuclear reactors. Russia's last major submarine accident
occurred in 1989, when the Komsomolets sank off the coast of
Norway, killing most of its crew.

(Eds: The text of Clinton's speech is available from The New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton savored what he called ``this
moment of unprecedented good fortune'' and, in a nostalgic and
sentimental valedictory Monday night, implored Americans to protect
his achievements by electing Vice President Al Gore to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best decisions of my life,'' he said, was ``asking
Al Gore to be my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's prepared text on the opening night of the 43rd
Democratic National Convention made no mention of Gov. George W.
Bush directly. But Clinton scoffed at the suggestion raised by the
Republican nominee at his convention two weeks ago that the nation
had stumbled into prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident,'' Clinton said, ``that we just coasted along, let's be
clear: America's success was not a matter of chance. It was a
matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no allusions to the personal scandals he has
weathered; at an event last week the president said his
transgressions should not tar Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton focused Monday on the high points of his entire
two terms, the longest presidential tenure of a Democrat since
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died in 1945 after 12 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also tried to transfer his popularity among the
Democratic faithful to Gore, who has had a difficult time rousing
his party. Clinton, who has said the election of Gore as his
successor is crucial to protecting his own legacy, offered this
testament: ``In the most difficult days of the last years, when we
faced the toughest issues _ of war and peace, of taking on powerful
special interests _ he was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to directly link Gore to the economic good times,
Clinton said of his budget plan: ``It passed by a single vote in
both Houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the deciding
vote. Not a single Republican supported it. Their leaders said it
would increase the deficit, kill jobs, and give us a one-way ticket
to recession.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Time has not been kind to those predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton, who is 53, was trying to hand off his party to
Gore, the political production Monday night at the Staples Center
here did not have the end-of-an-era emotions of Ronald Reagan's
farewell to his convention in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife, Hillary, also had a central role Monday night.
And in the text of her speech, she not only commended her husband
and blessed the nomination of Gore but sought to bolster her own
bid for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   After calling on the public to ``continue America's progress''
by electing Gore and his running-mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Mrs.
Clinton turned to her own race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' she said. ``I will always be profoundly grateful
to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years.
Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is: Thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   During a year in which Clinton has surrendered the political
stage to his vice president and to his wife _ only grudgingly, his
friends and advisers say _ the event Monday night was a prime-time
reminder of how the president dominates his party as a colossal
political and oratorical force.
</P>
<P>
   And to some delegates, it was a reminder that Gore faces a
daunting challenge in trying to inspire voters as skillfully as
Clinton _ who is widely regarded as the party's most adroit
campaigner since John F. Kennedy, who was nominated at the party's
convention in Los Angeles in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Gore was this: the more powerful that Clinton
was in his speech, the less likely that the vice president could
pull off a climactic acceptance speech on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sadness to this evening,'' said Cheri
Hamilton, a delegate from Kentucky who covered herself in
Clinton-Gore buttons. ``They have been a good team, Clinton and
Gore. Gore will work well with Leiberman. But I'm really going to
miss Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grizzard, a delegate from Florida who wore a Clinton '92
T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said, ``I would vote for
Clinton again if I could but, unfortunately, the Constitution says
I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere on the convention floor were signs reflecting the
crowd's deep affection for the Clintons. A woman, bopping to the
music, a smile plastered to her face, waved a sign that proclaimed,
``Iowa Loves Clinton.'' The same sign could be seen in the Kansas
section, and in Utah, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico _ and elsewhere.
The New York contingent hoisted dozens of ``Hillary'' posters,
waving them madly and passing a few to delegates in the Colorado
section.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Graves, 24, a delegate from Fayettville, Ark., was
particularly moved by Monday night's program because the president
is from her home state. ``This is all very sad,'' she said. ``He
has been ours, and he is leaving office. We are hopeful for Al
Gore, but he just isn't ours.''
</P>
<P>
   When short excerpts of past convention speeches by Democratic
presidents was shown on overhead screens, delegates responded with
warm applause for John F. Kennedy, and polite applause for Jimmy
Carter. But the moment Clinton's face filled the screen, the hall
exploded in a paroxysm of applause and cheers. It was impossible
not to notice that the sound fell slightly but unmistakably when a
clip of Gore followed.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for the bittersweet comments of some of the
4,339 delegates is that, given polls showing Gore trailing Bush,
they lack the confidence that Republicans enjoyed at their
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Clinton faced one of the most precarious political
challenges of his career: to offer a stout endorsement of Gore that
will spur Democrats _ and the American public _ to rally around the
vice president. But he also had to take care to leave Gore some
room to declare his independence.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his address, Clinton recounted what he considered
the triumphs of his administration. Invoking the slogan of his
acceptance speech four years ago, he declared, ``My fellow
Americans, tonight we can say with confidence: We built our bridge
to the 21st century. We crossed it together. And we're not going
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the new ticket would build on his foundation,
Clinton said, ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity
going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health
care and in family tax cuts that we can afford. In stark contrast,
the GOP wants to spend every dime of our projected surplus and then
some.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's presence Monday night could not help remind
viewers of the scandals of the Clinton administration that the Bush
campaign is intent on keeping alive. For some Democrats, Clinton's
departure from Los Angeles on Tuesday could not be too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois put it at a news
conference Monday, ``We've got to get Bill Clinton _ and I'm going
to say this quite frankly and quite bluntly _ out of town as
quickly as possible and get to these issues and not make our
convention some referendum on what occurred in the impeachment
process.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The evening was clearly an emotional crest for Clinton and his
stalwart supporters. Advisers to Clinton said he was choking up as
he rehearsed his lines earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the objective of pumping up Gore for four nights, the
Democrats sought to portray the Republicans as staging a masquerade
of moderation at their convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker stirred up the Democratic faithful by
upbraiding the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans put on quite a spectacle in Philadelphia,''
said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the convention and the
party's most prolific fund-raiser. ``They pretended they were
tolerant. They pretended they were moderates. They pretended they
cared about education, health care and the environment. Let's face
it, they pretended they were Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew cheers when he added, ``Governor Bush sure delivered a
pretty speech. But it reminded me of a Texas longhorn: Two points
with a lot of bull in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California welcomed the delegates to his
state, saying, ``Here in the home of the film industry, we've seen
the previews of the Republicans' movie: `George and Dick's
Excellent Adventure.' I don't think it's gonna make it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andrew Tobias, the Democratic Party's treasurer, said: ``The
Democratic leadership celebrates diversity, not for show _ for
real. They have made my life and the lives of millions of other gay
and lesbian Americans immeasurably better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the opening gavel fell, Gore was campaigning in Missouri,
emphasizing his commitment to Social Security and Medicare. During
a stop at President Harry Truman's hometown of Independence, he
said, ``Harry Truman said, when he started the fight for Medicare,
`We can afford many things, but the one thing we can ill afford is
not to have good health care for our people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That is as true today as it was true back then. I believe we
have to move step by step toward Harry S. Truman's goal of
universal health care for all of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   On this first day, there was not quite the harmony that so
marked the Republican convention. Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California rebuffed an offer to address the delegates, saying she
did not want it to appear as if she had been motivated by
``personal gain'' when, under pressure from the Gore campaign, she
agreed to move a fund-raiser from the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Clintons appeared here, two governors, Jean Shaheen
of New Hampshire and Gary Locke of Washington, struggled to perform
like talk show hosts as they asked individuals to tell how Clinton
administration accomplishments like the Family and Medical Leave
Act and a program to put more police officers on the street had
helped them.
</P>
<P>
   And the proceedings opened with an invocation that must have
been unnerving for the majority of delegates who favor abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In you, oh God, we trust that you will keep us ever committed
to protect the life and well-being of all people, but especially
unborn children,'' Cardinal Roger Mahony, the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Los Angeles, prayed.

  FIRST LADY DELIVERS EMOTIONAL SPEECH AT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
 &HT;    (EDs: UPDATES throughout)
 &HT;    By JUDY HOLLAND 
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking as first lady and
as a candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York, told delegates to
the Democratic National Convention in an emotional speech Monday
night that after eight years of her husband's tenure, ``I am proud
to stand here at this extraordinary moment _ the most peaceful,
prosperous, promising time in our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she urged them to work for the election of the ticket they
will officially nominate later this week. ``Now how can we continue
America's progress? By electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman the next
president and vice president of the United States,'' she declared
in her historic prime-time speech.
</P>
<P>
   And while not directly touting her own campaign, she said,
``Bill and I are closing one chapter of our lives _ and soon we'll
be starting a new one. For me, it will be up to the people of New
York to decide whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in
the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 18-minute address, punctuated by cheers from an
enthusiastic crowd, she provided a summary of the themes Democrats
have sounded throughout the campaign, but she listed them with
children as the main focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've held the hands of mothers and fathers who've lost their
children to gun violence,'' she said. ``It's time to honor their
pain by passing common-sense gun-safety laws that keep guns out of
the hands of children and criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In saying that she hasn't given up on health care, she said that
``it's time to pass a real patients bill of rights and provide
access to affordable health care for every single child and family
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   And in urging a vote for the Democratic ticket, she pleaded,
``At this moment of great potential, let's not squander our
children's futures. Let's elect leaders who will leave no child
behind. Leaders who don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk:
leaders like Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hoped her and her husband's starring roles on the
opening night of the convention before 4,368 delegates and 600
alternates will bolster her candidacy for the New York Senate in
the tight race against Republican Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island.
Two weeks ago Lazio declined an invitation to address the
Republican National Convention, saying he preferred to concentrate
on his campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, In his valedictory address to the party,
praised his wife for being ``a full-time advocate for her lifetime
cause'' _ helping children _ during his years in the White House..
</P>
<P>
   ``What a job she's done,'' he said. ``She championed the family
leave law, children's health insurance, and increased support for
foster children and adoptions.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hillary Clinton highlighted her concern for families,, she
also thanked the country for granting her family eight years in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for giving me the most extraordinary opportunity to
work here at home and around the world on the issues that matter
the most to children, families and women,'' she said, signaling to
New York voters that she has been more than a traditional first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your faith and support in good times _ and in
bad. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the honor and
privilege of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Her speech appeared squarely aimed at women, a key voting bloc
in her adopted state of New York where she is trailing Lazio among
white women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute poll put her
ahead, 46 percent to 43 percent. But a few days earlier, the Utica,
N.Y.-based Zogby International Pollfound Lazio ahead 50 percent to
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady stressed that the Clinton administration created
``a stronger, better country than we were in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill, Al, Tipper and I got on that bus after our
convention eight years ago, we saw faces of hope _ but also faces
of despair _ fathers out of work, mothers trapped on welfare,
children with unmet medical needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that while the Clinton adminstration had made
``great progress in the last eight years ... we still still have a
lot of work to do. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``When a child can't go to school without fearing guns and
violence _ that's a child left behind. When a child's illness is
treated too late _ or not at all _ because a hard-working parent
can't afford health insurance _ that's a child left behind. When a
child struggles to learn in an over crowded classroom _ that's a
child left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the first lady appeared at Raleigh Studios
in Hollywood at a reception honoring Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who
bowed out of the Senate race when Mrs. Clinton made it clear she
wanted to run.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon, sponsored in part by the Hollywood studio
DreamWorks SKG was intended for 500, including many female members
of Congress, but several tables were empty.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton praised Lowey for championing abortion rights,
fighting to include contraception in federal health plans and
opposing the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be absolutely critical as we work to elect Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman that women know what's at stake in this
election,`` the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Lazio criticized her for holding weekend
fund-raisers in Los Angeles that netted more than $1 million in
soft money, the unregulated contributions to political parties that
are supposed to be used for getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Mrs. Clinton ``should return to New York, reveal the
special interest sources of all that money, and join me in
banishing it from this race altogether.''

GREED RUNS RAMPANT IN TNT'S `BULL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because TV dramas tended to be simplistic, the old idea was to
sort out good and evil and choose your rooting interest.
</P>
<P>
   How totally yesterday. Wall Street shark Robert Roberts (Donald
Moffat) sets us straight in the first scene of the TNT series
``Bull.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the old gray lion at the brokerage house of Merriweather
Marx, and he's rallying the troops after a 324-point drop in the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sole purpose in life,'' he says, pacing the brokerage's
war room, ``the one reason God put us on this planet, is to make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that's what it said on one of Moses' tablets.
</P>
<P>
   The show, TNT's first original series, proceeds without a trace
of compassion, or what we might arcanely refer to as humanity.
</P>
<P>
   It's just big sharks versus little sharks. Go forth and gobble
money. Watch your call options and damn the margins.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have expected something more old-fashioned from TNT.
</P>
<P>
   TV is spewing out two new shows about Wall Street. The other
one, due in the fall, is a Darren Star series called ``The
$treet.'' It looks at Wall Street and seems to decide that sex
makes the world go around.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe TNT has it right; ``Bull'' feels more authentic and,
despite its titanium hardness, it's a coolly entertaining piece of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere is on three times Wednesday night, at 8, 9 and 10.
The usual time will be 10 p.m. Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Moffat, who'll appear occasionally in the weekly series, huffs
and puffs tonight, and fires a naif of a young broker, and makes an
illicit killing with insider information.
</P>
<P>
   But the real action swings toward his grandson, Robert Roberts
III (nicknamed ``Ditto'' and played by George Newbern), who defies
the old man and bolts the brokerage with a handful of colleagues to
form his own firm.
</P>
<P>
   They end the episode hoping to attract a proven sharpie, Hunter
Lasky (Stanley Tucci, who's committed to be in six of the first 13
episodes), to their renegade firm. Moffat's senior Roberts, a man
who'd sup on sons and grandsons, will surely be looking to crush
the upstarts, if he doesn't mind soiling the sole of his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Yoba plays Corey Granville, a broker marked by Moffat for
a limited future because he is black. Alicia Coppola is Marissa
Rufo, a rainmaker who casts in with the upstarts. Ian Kahn is Marty
Decker, a mergers-and-acquisitions expert. Elisabeth Rohm is Alison
Jeffers, another of the Young Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wiehl shoulders a burden as Carson Boyd, a young
broker with a glimmer of warmth. Boyd is from North Dakota, which
is shorthand for naive and thoroughly wowed by it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money,'' Boyd says. ``It's about being at
the heart of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Maximum North Dakota. Possibly even Minot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull'' looks and sounds much like a David E. Kelley show,
though its pedigree lies closer to ``Law &AMP; Order,'' where its
co-executive producer and top writer, Michael Chernuchin, labored
for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is itchy and the show whizzes by with Olympics sprint
dialogue, the sort of tough eloquence and speed you hear only
onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   But then, there's not a millisecond to waste. Time is money, and
money is all the purpose in the world.

 &HT;    HILLARY CLINTON PLAYS DUAL ROLES
 &HT;    By JILL VEJNOSKA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Introduced first and foremost as the first lady to
delegates who clearly had other things in mind for her, Hillary
Rodham Clinton spoke her way into history at the Democratic
National Convention Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Making her first ever run for public office, the Democratic
Senate nominee from New York nonetheless got a nationally
televised, prime-time speaking role, right before President Bill
Clinton's eagerly awaited speech.
</P>
<P>
   And despite having to wait to start her remarks while delegates
lustily sang ``New York, New York'' and flashed signs bearing
pointed messages like ``It Takes a Senator,'' Mrs. Clinton devoted
most of her speech to promoting Al Gore's presidential campaign and
praising her husband's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Most, but not quite all.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' Mrs. Clinton drew to a close with a line that
sparked huge cheers even as it added to the sense of uncertainty
swirling around her role here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during a backbreaking schedule of events that began last
Friday night, she was just as likely to be meeting people as the
aspiring New York Senate hopeful as White House wife.
</P>
<P>
   It got confusing at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's invited as the first lady,'' explained Dianna Aviv of
United Jewish Charities, one of four Jewish organizations that
sponsored a reception Sunday afternoon at which both President
Clinton and Mrs. Clinton spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that wasn't whom everyone in the crowd expected to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume she's coming here as a Senate candidate,'' said Rep.
Martin Frost (D-Texas), standing amidst cobblestones and fake
storefronts on Sony Pictures Studio's ``Main Street'' set. ``She
certainly should be. She's running, right?''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it. If that wasn't always obvious from what
she said _ her 12 minute speech at Sunday's reception was almost
entirely devoted to boosting the Al Gore-Joe Lieberman White House
ticket, for instance _ it was from what she did. Which was pretty
much everything a candidate does these days, beginning with an
appearance Friday night on the ``Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno, and
continuing on through an hourlong visit Sunday night to the
welcoming party for New York state's convention delegation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, while her husband played golf, she was again
visiting with the New York delegation over breakfast. She then left
those she wants to represent to attend an event honoring those
whose ranks she wants to join.
</P>
<P>
   This time the location was Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, where
the ``Salute to Democratic Women in Congress'' featured TV stars
Laura Innes (``ER'') and Kelly Williams (``The Practice''), and
special tribute was paid to New York congresswoman Nita M. Lowey,
that state's likely Democratic Senate candidate had Mrs. Clinton
not decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the not-so-small matter of very big money. A
veteran of raising election dollars for others as first lady, Mrs.
Clinton has been unabashedly filling her own campaign coffers here.
Estimates are that she will have raised as much as $4 million by
the time she leaves Tuesday morning. And turnabout clearly is fair
play in the ``first household'': A concert and dinner Saturday
night that was billed as a ``Hollywood Tribute to William Jefferson
Clinton'' was expected to raise more than $2 million for her Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, trying to force Mrs. Clinton to pick one role and stick
with it here is impossible and a bit shortsighted, one veteran New
York Democratic politician suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can be separated,'' Rep. Jerrold Nadler
said at Sunday's event at Sony Pictures. ``What she says here can
have a positive effect on her campaign and on the Gore-Lieberman
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may have been the weight of those dual roles that
caused Mrs. Clinton to sound almost shy when she finally got around
to mentioning her Senate campaign in her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Or she may just have assumed a third role, that of a skilled
politician. Badly needing Jewish support to win in New York and
speaking before a crowd of nearly 4,000 people clearly energized by
the selection of Lieberman _ an Orthodox Jew _ to the No. 2 spot on
the ticket, Mrs. Clinton may simply have understood the importance
of focusing on another campaign to subtly enhance her own.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, she spent nearly eight minutes discussing
the importance of a Gore-Lieberman victory before finally slipping
in a passing bit of self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it will really matter who's in the Senate,'' she said
about preserving abortion rights, gun control and other bedrock
Democratic issues. ``Of course, as an aside, I'd like to be there
working with Joe and Al to make this happen.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ QUESTION: We know that many of our employees are
using the Internet for personal matters on company time, and this
is strictly against company policy. If we try to enforce the
policy, we may lose several employees, and, frankly, they are
getting their work done even if they are on the Internet. Is there
an upside to all of this? E.K.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It's never a good policy to have a policy that few
people follow, yet many companies are tangled in this type of Web
problem. On the one hand, their policies prohibit personal use of
the Internet on company time, premises and equipment, but at the
same time employees are using it for personal matters while still
meeting their work objectives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the upside, there are some arguments indicating that
employees' personal use of the Internet actually contributes to
their productivity. For example, if an employee can take care of
some grocery shopping on the Internet during his or her normal work
hours, perhaps the employee will stay at work longer.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps there is a personal issue on which the employee
needs some expert advice. Rather than stewing over the issue and
letting it interfere with his or her work, a visit to an
appropriate Web site may give the employee the answers, and then he
or she can get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   With employees spending long hours on the job, and many
employers already taking steps to cover some of the employees'
personal chores and provide more work/personal life balance, it is
evident that some rethinking of Internet policies may be in order.
At this point, you should consider forming a task force of
employees and managers to jointly develop an Internet usage policy
that people will actually use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our large communication company has implemented a monthly
evaluation of each work group to increase productivity. The result
is the low performer is harassed by management even if the group is
satisfactory in every way. We are being appraised strictly on data
the employees themselves supply to management. What to do? G.L. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like it is time to evaluate the evaluation system.
If its objective is to increase productivity, it is definitely
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have found that feedback on performance can in fact
be motivational. There can be an improvement in motivation and
productivity when employees learn about the areas in which they may
need improvement, followed by some constructive feedback and
guidance. In this context, even feedback from one's peers can be
quite valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In your company, however, the feedback is not feedback at all.
It is simply a form of bullying. For that reason, you should
discuss the situation with your human resources director or senior
management.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company has adopted a peer review system, perhaps you
should suggest the company go all the way and implement a
360-degree feedback program. With this system, employees are
evaluated not only by their peers and superiors, but by their
subordinates as well. With some training for all involved, this can
be quite motivational.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it can be a productive way to provide your
managers with some constructive feedback regarding their
destructive feedback. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am the head receptionist at a fairly large organization.
There are security guards stationed near the reception desk, and
some of these guards have been reported by part-time receptionists
for talking excessively on the phone and for being away for long
periods of time. After the guards are reprimanded by their
department head, they do not speak to me (I did not report them)
and the atmosphere is very unpleasant. Do you have any suggestions?
L.W. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Managers need to be on guard for the very behaviors being
displayed by these guards. When employees are reprimanded for
inappropriate behavior and then demonstrate a lack of teamwork and
cooperation as a result, all they are doing is engaging in another
behavior that is worthy of a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   You should make one attempt to open the lines of communication
with the guards. If they choose to remain silent, you should
discuss the matter with management.
</P>
<P>
   This situation highlights not only questionable action by the
guards but questionable inaction by management. When management
learns about a situation in which employees are spending time on
personal calls and activities, there is a need for more than
disciplinary action. This is the precise kind of situation that
calls for management to spend less time in meetings or behind a
desk and more time on the floors.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the situation with management, you can suggest
that they come to your department and check out these guarded
behaviors. &QL;

EXCERPT FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S ADDRESS IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
 (With DEM-HILLARY) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is an excerpt from remarks delivered on Monday night
by Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles:
</P>
<P>
   I'm proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment, the most
peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   How can we continue America's progress? By electing Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman the next president and vice president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he was vice president, I admired Al for his
leadership in the Senate, his understanding of the future, his
pioneering efforts to fight environmental threats to our children,
his work with Tipper to promote responsible parenting _ and what
great parents the two of them are.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched him as Bill's trusted partner in the White House.
Together, they made the hard decisions to renew our economy and our
national spirit; to advance democracy and defend freedom around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   And I can't wait to watch Al Gore take the oath of office on
Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to him will be his wonderful wife and my dear
friend, who inspires us through her work for the homeless and her
advocacy on behalf of mental health. Tipper Gore will make a great
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   And, the country has again seen Al Gore's leadership in his
choice of Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Joe Lieberman 30 years ago when Bill and I were law
students. We saw then what America sees now _ a person of uncommon
wisdom and integrity. I admire Joe's work to reduce the violence in
our media. And I appreciate his steadfast support for a woman's
right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   With him is his remarkable wife, Hadassah, the immigrant
daughter of Holocaust survivors. Their story tells our children
that in America, no dream is beyond our reach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill and Al promised to put people first. That simply
meant that when people live up to their responsibilities, we ought
to live up to ours and give them the tools and the opportunities
they need to build better lives. That's the basic bargain at the
heart of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   From a stronger economy to more Americans attending college to a
cleaner environment, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have put people
first. Not only that, they put children first.
</P>
<P>
   More children lifted out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   More children receiving Head Start, child care and after-school
care.
</P>
<P>
   More children than ever getting immunized against disease.
</P>
<P>
   More children whose parents can take family and medical leave to
care for them.
</P>
<P>
   And more neglected and abused foster children being adopted into
loving, permanent families.
</P>

 By ANDREW GUMBEL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There could be no more irresistible political
farewell. Like the flawed hero of his own Hollywood movie,
President Bill Clinton prepared to address the Democratic Party
faithful Monday night (Monday) on a wave of high emotion,
rhetorical magnetism, mixed feelings about his glaring personal
shortcomings, and extravagant praise for the man who would succeed
him, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the balmy, dream-fuelled Southern California that he
has made his spiritual home every bit as much as Arkansas or the
White House, Clinton could play to his favorite audience of movie
stars, political wheeler-dealers, philanthropic billionaires and
party fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, over the weekend, he had been reduced to tears by the
generous tributes of the Hollywood glitterati. Now it was his turn
to return the favor, and use his considerable charisma and
rhetorical skill to propel the Democrats forward and stir their
excitement about the new race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give Al Gore and Joe Lieberman eight years and you will
see that the best is yet to be,'' Clinton told a group of party
donors at a brunch meeting _ the line he was widely expected to
take on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Los Angeles is Clinton's town, it is hardly Gore's. The
flighty, fiercely competitive, morally ambiguous atmosphere may be
a West Coast mirror of the Clinton White House, but it doesn't suit
the earnest, buttoned-down, somewhat prudish temperament of the
Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the Emerald City, it will inescapably seem that the Wizard of
Oz is handing over to the Tin Man.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between Gore and the Clintons, both Bill and
Hillary, has been palpable and much remarked upon ever since they
entered the White House eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past few days, as the Clintons have coasted
gleefully from the Hollywood Hills to the Malibu beachfront to be
feted and showered with attention at every turn, the Gore camp has
had to worry about being upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton's speeches were expected
to be ``amazingly gracious'' about the vice president. But that did
not alleviate the risk that, just by opening his mouth and smiling
his infectiously boyish smile, Clinton would put his putative
successor into the shade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. media has talked of little else _ dredging up the
misgivings Gore had right from the start about Clinton's slipshod
sexual morality and Mrs. Clinton's overweening ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore's aides have characterized Hillary as something of
a Wicked Witch of the East for daring to run for the Senate in New
York _ an ``act of indescribable selfishness,'' according to one
Gore official, that risks sapping attention and campaign funds from
the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Clintons have spent their time in California
raising money for her Senate battle and his presidential library,
not the Gore-Lieberman campaign, has hardly improved matters.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Democrats are not seeking to pretend, as the
Republicans did in Philadelphia two weeks ago, that they speak with
a single, spin-doctored, electorally friendly voice.
</P>
<P>
   With the party genuinely torn over its loyalties, between big
business and the unions, between economic growth and environmental
protection, and between the suburban middle classes and the working
poor, it is seeking to make a virtue of necessity and present the
divisions and disagreements as a sign of dynamism and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's New York Times was filled with convention-related
advertisements challenging Gore to declare his true loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   One urged him to drop the Democrats' pursuit of a Star
Wars-style missile defense system; another questioned the Clinton
administration's record on protecting forests; and a third, from
the bus riders' union, asked Gore: ``Which side are you on? Racism
or civil rights?''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore seeks to define himself as his own man, he will need to
answer and fend off such criticisms. Already, much has been made of
his running mate Lieberman's differing _ and invariably more
conservative _ views on such matters as school vouchers, Social
Security fund investments and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Although the appointment of Lieberman has gone down well _ a
Reuters poll Monday showed the gap between Gore and his Republican
opponent, George W. Bush, closing to just three percentage points _
it will be this convention week that determines whether Gore can
push himself firmly into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the Clinton farewell will be his first big test. &QL;

CLINTON LEAVES LARGE LEGACY IN NORTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As his motorcade snaked onto the tarmac at
Seattle's Boeing Field during the 1992 campaign, with Mount Rainier
seeming to rise out of the end of the runway, Bill Clinton mused:
``I think I may move out here some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will divide his time between New York and Arkansas come
January. But the Pacific Northwest has seen more of the 42nd
president than any of his predecessors. He has made 12 trips to
Washington and Oregon, along with two stops in British Columbia,
since assuming office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Has any other president had as much impact on the Northwest than
Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never. Not even close. No president has even done this much
for this region,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash. ``He may not be a
perfect individual but he has been a helluva president.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks may be exaggerating a bit. Franklin D. Roosevelt left a
massive presidential imprint on the region, building great dams on
the Columbia River and creating Olympic National Park. But Clinton
has, undeniably, made his own impact.
</P>
<P>
   He recently designated a 200,000-acre Hanford Reach National
Monument on the one undammed stretch of the Columbia River. Clinton
has curtailed logging and moved to permanently halt roadbuilding
over millions of acres of national forest land.
</P>
<P>
   He personally helped Boeing sell jets to Saudi Arabia and get
Washington apples into the Japanese market. Against resistance in
his own party, Clinton has pushed for expanded trade with China _
and basked in successes of the Northwest's technology economy until
his Justice Department launched a landmark federal antitrust
lawsuit that may break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also helped put the Northwest on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   He picked Vancouver, B.C., for a one-on-one summit with Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin, using his people skills to cover for
Yeltsin's apparent inebriation.
</P>
<P>
   On a stormy November day in 1993, he took a boatload of
Asia-Pacific leaders to Blake Island off Seattle for a daylong
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   He drove riot-scarred streets of Seattle last November for an
appeal to World Trade Organization ministers to open trade
negotiations to more public scrutiny and deal with labor standards
and environmental protection. They gave him a cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Citing how Washington and the Seattle area have prospered over
the past eight years, King County Executive Ron Sims on Monday
exclaimed on the convention floor: ``Mr. President, thank you!''
</P>
<P>
   The view is far from unanimous. ``Dictator by fiat!'' Idaho's
GOP Sen. Larry Craig, a timber industry ally, described Clinton in
denouncing the president's plan to keep roadless 43 million acres
of national forest land.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton created the Hanford Reach National Monument, GOP
Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington termed it ``one more example of
Washington, D.C., deciding for Washington communities something I
believe they are fully capable of deciding for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, the Northwest has smiled on Clinton. On a
Seattle-to-Portland bus tour in 1996, more than 60,000 people
turned out to cheer Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Clinton
handily carried Washington and Oregon in both his runs for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president began the bus tour in a foul mood, furious at CIA
Director John Deutch for conceding at a congressional hearing that
a recent air raid hadn't weakened Iraq's President Saddan Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulated by crowds, however, Clinton was soon plunging into
rope lines. Using the microphone in his bus, the president
endlessly said ``Hi there'' and ``Thank you for coming!'' to waving
bystanders and, in one case, a large black labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   The weather cleared, as often happened when Clinton was around.
At Woodland, while looking at cleanup of flood damage, he joined
Gore to push a stuck police vehicle out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the road has been rocky. Clinton stumped Seattle
twice in closing weeks of the 1994 mid-term elections. When the
votes were counted, however, six Democratic House seats had flipped
to the Republicans. Spokane's Tom Foley became the first incumbent
House speaker to lose a re-election race since 1860.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped into a Northwest quagmire when he convened a
1993 summit to work out a solution to the region's forest crisis.
U.S. District Judge William Dwyer had halted almost all logging on
federal land because the Bush administration failed to follow the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people weren't satisfied with the outcome, but we
stopped shouting at each other,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's forest plan has reduced national forest
logging to less than 20 percent of its level in the early 1990s _
too deep a cut for mill towns, but not enough for unyielding
environmentalists who want a halt to all logging of federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush has sharply
criticized Clinton's record in the Northwest, particularly on
forests, fish and national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintains that cutbacks in national forests have had a
``devastating'' impact on small timber towns. He has accused the
administration of delaying and ducking a decision on whether to
recommend breaching of four Snake River dams to restore salmon
runs. The dams would stay in place on his watch, Bush promises.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also depicted Clinton's creation of new national
monuments in Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona as a
dictatorial, Washington, D.C.-driven policy that has ignored
feelings of local people.
</P>
<P>
   During his second term, Clinton has devoted Northwest visits to
diplomacy and closed-door fund-raisers with Democratic donors. Gore
took over the job of rousing Democrats at rallies, particularly in
1998 when Clinton was forced to the sidelines by the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, Clinton's motorcade may still tie up rush
hour traffic in Seattle, but the president is unlikely to be seen
yelling ``Hellooo Seattle!'' at another Pike Place Market rally, or
plunging into a rope line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Al Gore's job, that's Joe Lieberman's job. I don't
think you'll see the president doing that,'' said presidential
press secretary Joe Lockhart.

QUARTERBACKS UNDER THE GUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ As if it wasn't bad enough that Cory Paus and
Ryan McCann, with a total of 28 sacks, one broken collarbone and a
loss to USC, lived under constant pressure as freshmen last season.
Now their own coach is bringing the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Bob Toledo how important the quarterback position is to the
Bruins this year and you get no poor-mouthing about how he's only
one of 11 players on offense, or protests that the quarterback gets
too much credit and too much blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the quarterback goes,'' Toledo said bluntly. ``So goes the
Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins seem to have many of the ingredients to at least
reverse last year's 4-7 record _ their worst since 1989 _ but if
they don't get improved play at quarterback, it won't matter that
DeShaun Foster, Freddie Mitchell and Brian Poli-Dixon are healthy
and a total of 17 starters are returning.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is using the first seven to 10 days of fall camp, which
began Saturday, to evaluate Paus, the right-hander with the
accurate arm and strong leadership, and McCann, the tall
left-hander with the powerful arm and classic build. Scott McEwan,
a junior with a weakbut accurate arm and a strong understanding of
the offense, is getting about 20 percent of the reps in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't looking for the most spectacular quarterback,
just the most steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start with the idea that you're not going to
get us beat,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``We want to
make the routine plays consistently. That's something that both of
these kids can do. The emphasis will be on executing with as few
mistakes as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an area in which McCann and Paus struggled as freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   While Paus started seven games, he threw nine interceptions to
seven touchdowns and floundered in a three-game drought when the
Bruins were outscored 105-14 by Cal, Oregon State and Arizona.
McCann, who came off the bench to lead the Bruins to their most
significant win _ a 23-20 overtime upset of Washington that knocked
the Huskies out of the Rose Bowl _ threw three interceptions and no
touchdowns in his first start the next week against USC.
</P>
<P>
   They also had problems handling snaps and looked befuddled when
opponents blitzed or disguised coverages. It also didn't help that
so much of the talent around them was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got acclimated to college football last year,'' said Paus,
who is recovered from the broken collar bone and offseason shoulder
surgery. ``The learning curve is pretty good, but I've got a better
feel for the offense and I'm throwing the ball better. I'm more
confident than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McCann: ``The SC experience was so important for me, going
through all the preparation. I feel like I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But how much progress can they make? History says it won't be
enough to lead the Bruins, picked third in the conference by most
preseason publications, to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It might be possible for young quarterbacks to win in other
conferences _ redshirt freshmen Michael Vick of Virginia Tech and
Brooks Bollinger of Wisconsin did last year _ but not the Pac-10.
Not since sophomore Billy Joe Hobert led Washington to the Rose
Bowl and a share of the national title in 1991 has a Pac-10 team
played in the Rose Bowl without a fourth-year quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's last four Rose Bowl quarterbacks _ Stanford's Todd
Husak, UCLA's Cade McNown, Washington State's Ryan Leaf and Arizona
State's Jake Plummer _ have two things in common: All played as
freshman and all are in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, the more experience you have at that
position the better you are,'' Toledo said. ``Our conference has
always been more pass-oriented and has been known as a
quarterback's league where a lot is asked of the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the defenses have become so much more sophisticated.
They've become a lot more pro-oriented with things like zone
blitzes. There's a lot more to prepare for now. Not only do you
have to learn the offense, but you have to learn all those
complicated defenses.``
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A around Westwood is McNown. He was wildly inconsistent
his first two years before blossoming as a junior and leading the
Bruins on a 20-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo evaluates the quarterbacks, at least he knows he's
further along than last season. When the Bruins came to camp last
summer, Toledo gave five quarterbacks an equal opportunity. Then he
narrowed it to two _ Paus and Drew Bennett, who split time the
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Bruins will start the season _ against No.
3-ranked Alabama _ with one quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the next McNown might not have ended, but they
hope the search for their next quarterback will.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Cade McNown only comes around so often,'' said defensive end
Kenyon Coleman. ``We don't need Cade. We just need somebody to get
the ball to the receivers. We need a general to lead the
soldiers.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ There could be no more irresistible political
farewell. Like the flawed hero of his own Hollywood movie,
President Bill Clinton prepared to address the Democratic Party
faithful Monday night (Monday) on a wave of high emotion,
rhetorical magnetism, mixed feelings about his glaring personal
shortcomings, and extravagant praise for the man who would succeed
him, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the balmy, dream-fuelled Southern California that he
has made his spiritual home every bit as much as Arkansas or the
White House, Clinton could play to his favorite audience of movie
stars, political wheeler-dealers, philanthropic billionaires and
party fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, over the weekend, he had been reduced to tears by the
generous tributes of the Hollywood glitterati. Now it was his turn
to return the favor, and use his considerable charisma and
rhetorical skill to propel the Democrats forward and stir their
excitement about the new race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give Al Gore and Joe Lieberman eight years and you will
see that the best is yet to be,'' Clinton told a group of party
donors at a brunch meeting _ the line he was widely expected to
take on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Los Angeles is Clinton's town, it is hardly Gore's. The
flighty, fiercely competitive, morally ambiguous atmosphere may be
a West Coast mirror of the Clinton White House, but it doesn't suit
the earnest, buttoned-down, somewhat prudish temperament of the
Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the Emerald City, it will inescapably seem that the Wizard of
Oz is handing over to the Tin Man.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between Gore and the Clintons, both Bill and
Hillary, has been palpable and much remarked upon ever since they
entered the White House eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past few days, as the Clintons have coasted
gleefully from the Hollywood Hills to the Malibu beachfront to be
feted and showered with attention at every turn, the Gore camp has
had to worry about being upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton's speeches were expected
to be ``amazingly gracious'' about the vice president. But that did
not alleviate the risk that, just by opening his mouth and smiling
his infectiously boyish smile, Clinton would put his putative
successor into the shade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. media has talked of little else _ dredging up the
misgivings Gore had right from the start about Clinton's slipshod
sexual morality and Mrs. Clinton's overweening ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore's aides have characterized Hillary as something of
a Wicked Witch of the East for daring to run for the Senate in New
York _ an ``act of indescribable selfishness,'' according to one
Gore official, that risks sapping attention and campaign funds from
the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Clintons have spent their time in California
raising money for her Senate battle and his presidential library,
not the Gore-Lieberman campaign, has hardly improved matters.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Democrats are not seeking to pretend, as the
Republicans did in Philadelphia two weeks ago, that they speak with
a single, spin-doctored, electorally friendly voice.
</P>
<P>
   With the party genuinely torn over its loyalties, between big
business and the unions, between economic growth and environmental
protection, and between the suburban middle classes and the working
poor, it is seeking to make a virtue of necessity and present the
divisions and disagreements as a sign of dynamism and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's New York Times was filled with convention-related
advertisements challenging Gore to declare his true loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   One urged him to drop the Democrats' pursuit of a Star
Wars-style missile defense system; another questioned the Clinton
administration's record on protecting forests; and a third, from
the bus riders' union, asked Gore: ``Which side are you on? Racism
or civil rights?''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore seeks to define himself as his own man, he will need to
answer and fend off such criticisms. Already, much has been made of
his running mate Lieberman's differing _ and invariably more
conservative _ views on such matters as school vouchers, Social
Security fund investments and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Although the appointment of Lieberman has gone down well _ a
Reuters poll Monday showed the gap between Gore and his Republican
opponent, George W. Bush, closing to just three percentage points _
it will be this convention week that determines whether Gore can
push himself firmly into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the Clinton farewell will be his first big test. &QL;

NEW YORK WOMAN AWAKENS TO GUN-POINT ROBBERY BY SUSPECT DRESSED AS
GOOFY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISSA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sign that nothing in New York is free of
Disney's influence these days, a suspect dressed as Goofy is wanted
for a break-in robbery in the Bronx. And the bumbling, buck-toothed
character has an accomplice, disguised as either Elmo of Sesame
Street or Dr. Seuss' Grinch.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no Dr. Seuss story. The two suspects were reported
to be armed and considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:45 a.m. Monday, Theresa Dassa, 58, reported to police that
she awoke to find she had been joined in her second-floor bedroom
by someone in a full-body Goofy costume, and someone she reported
was dressed as Elmo, the squeaky-voiced Muppet. But she told the
police that costume was green, not red like Elmo, which led
detectives to suspect the Grinch.
</P>
<P>
   Dassa said she was not tickled to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Dassa reported that the suspects pointed pistols at
her head and her ribs, and stole jewelry, a television and $600
from the kitchen. They also took her debit card, demanding the PIN
number. They then fled in her car, a 1996 dark blue Hyundai Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I opened my eyes, because I was fast asleep, I didn't
even know if I was dreaming or if this was really happening,'' a
shaken Dassa said later Monday. ``But when I saw the two gun
barrels pointed at me straight in the face, I knew it was real.''
</P>
<P>
   She insisted her identification of Elmo was accurate. Her
grandchildren are fans, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the furry costume against my skin,'' she said.
``They had the actual suits, like they wear in Disneyland,'' Dassa
said. ``I mean, this is why, for the moment, I thought I was
dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Virginia Farrell, said she rushed next door when she
heard the police arrive. ``A lot of people were saying, `Thank God
she wasn't hurt,' but she was,'' Farrell said. ``She was
hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Dassa's husband, Jack, died about two years ago. She lives in
the Country Club section of the northeast Bronx. There have been
several robberies in the neighborhood in recent months, said
Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dassa's other next-door neighbors awoke to find the
living room windows open and about $25,000 missing, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between my house and her house, they hit Lotto,'' said
Jeannine Krzyck, 35.
</P>
<P>
   The police said it was not clear if the cases were linked.
</P>
<P>
   Goofy and his sidekick are still at large, and the disguises are
still a matter of mystery. However, Disney does make an adult-size
Goofy costume: it sells for $39.99 on the Disney store's Web site.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nn Thursday night, Vice President Al Gora must
walk on to the platform at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and
give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Success, as he accepts the Democratic nomination, will keep him
in the presidential race with a sporting chance of winning. Failure
could srell the beginning of the end of his political career, at
52.
</P>
<P>
   To subceed, Gore must parry the attabks _ overt and implied _
from the platform of the Republican Convention two weeks a'o, but
he must also present himself as a party leader and
president-in-waiting, a superior alternative to George W. Bush and
his well-drilled, seemingly moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The last is perhaps the simplest. The policy ideas set out by
Bush left gaping holes just waiting gor the Democratic nominee to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   Health care,(pensions, low pay and the environment, as well as
reform of the business-dominated system of polItical funding, are
areas of public concern that Gore caj usefully exploit.
</P>
<P>
   He can claim a share of the credit for the U.S.'s longest period
of economic expansion and cite his eighT years' White House
experience to support his claim to be a better steward of the
country's prosperity into the future.
</P>
<P>
   He can also upstage Bush's boast of leading a diverse and
inclusive party by having named Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew,
as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But Gore's weaknesses lie less in content than
in manner and character. From his earliest years as a congressman
from Tennessea, even his supporters had nagging doubts about the
mismatch between the scale of his ambition and his political$and
intellectual abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Having attained his party's presidential nomination after two
failed attempts, he must now show that there is genuine substance
beneath the exaggerated ardor or anger he often displays in his
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows he has experience; what they question is whether
he has the spine to take the hard decisions ajd the insight to read
the nation's mood.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presIdent's intellectual caliber, compared with that of
Bush anyway, is not at issue; his political sensitivity and his
ability to connect with the voters are.
</P>
<P>
   While described universally as delightful and even funny in
private, Gore lacks Bush's charm in public. It may be that the
presence of his running mate, the far more relaxed and even
garrulous Lieberman, will loosen him up.
</P>
<P>
   But unless he can make up in gravitas and honesty what he lacks
in charisma, Gore will fare badly by comparison with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas, though, is not the onhy, or even the most
threatening, point of comparison. In Los Angeles, Gore has somehow
to emerge from"the giant shadow of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Making the move from vice president to presidential nominee is
always problematical, but Clinton has given Gore an even harder job
than Ronald Reagan gave George Burh senior in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Both two-term presidents had an exceptional talent for
communicating ajd an uncanny sense of the national mood. Like Bush
with Reagan, Gore will never match Clinton: he hacks his personal
magnetism, political instinct and quickness of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gore is worse off than Bush, however, is in the issue of
ethics. Clinton bequeaths to Gore the fallout from White House
sleaze and his own scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Against that, Gore can set the solidity of his family. The
choice of Diebermaj, one of Clinton's earliest critics in the
Lewinsky affair, has given him one degree of separation. Clinton's
own new apology last week gave him another.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is not without ethical burdens of his own: his
hesitation about condemning Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky is one;
the legality of his fund-raising and his equivocation about it is
another. Somehow he must allay voters' doubts on these scores.
</P>
<P>
   While planned to look less slick than the Republigans'
song-and-dance show of unity and moderation, the Democratic
Convention has been no less choreographed, and to one end adone:
portraying Al Gore as president-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, Bill and Hillary, will address the convention
Monday and then leave the West Coast altogether.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no joint$Clinton-Gore fund-raising or platform
appearance. The remaining three nights will see the progressive
reintroduction of Al Gore: family man, caring politician, national
leader. &QL;

RUSSIA'S LAST CZAR AND HIS FAMILY ARE CANONIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to add byline and updating throughout) 
By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian Orthodox Church today announced the
canonization of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his immediate
family for their ``humbleness, patience and meekness'' when they
were imprisoned and executed by the Bolsheviks 82 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The elevation of the last czar to sainthood has long been
demanded by powerful right-wing factions in the church and had been
the subject of considerable debate and controversy. Revered as a
martyr and victim of Bolshevism by monarchists and conservatives,
Nicholas is also blamed by many Russians for inept, inflexible and
harsh rule that only hastened revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to canonize him, which had been anticipated for
several weeks, was made behind closed doors by Patriarch Alexy II
and the church's 150 hierarchs, sitting as the Council of Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops did not proclaim the Romanovs as ``martyrs,'' or
those who died specifically for their Christian convictions, but
instead declared them ``passion bearers,'' a category used to
identify believers who, in imitation of Christ, endured suffering
and death at the hands of political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops also canonized 860 others who were killed by the
Bolsheviks, many of them priests and monks, as martyrs and
``confessors of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's press service said: ``The council has sanctified as
passion bearers among the throng of new martyrs and confessors of
the faith, the Russian Emperor Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra,
Czarevitch Alexei, Princesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.''
</P>
<P>
   The formal services will take place Sunday at the Church of
Christ the Savior, an imposing cathedral near the Kremlin that was
rebuilt in recent years on the site of a church destroyed on
Stalin's orders in 1931. Two years ago, remains identified as those
of Nicholas, his wife and three of their children, along with four
servants killed with them, were buried in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were exhumed from a forest grave outside
Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains in 1991 and identified after
DNA testing. The remains of two other children were never found.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian church has not recognized these remains as belonging
to the czar, and neither Patriarch Alexy nor any other bishop
attended the simple interment, though after a last-minute decision,
the then-president, Boris Yeltsin, did.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanovs were executed 16 months after Nicholas abdicated
the throne on March 15, 1917, as revolutionary fervor swept Russia.
He and his family were detained by the Bolsheviks and eventually
sent to Yekaterinburg, where on July 17, 1918, they were shot dead
in the basement of a merchant's house by a squad of Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication of whether President Vladimir
Putin would attend the formal canonization rites. Putin has not
made his position on the canonization known, though there has been
speculation in the Russian press that he supports the act for its
powerful political symbolism. Putin's first months in office have
been marked by efforts to restore central authority to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is a strong guy, and Nicholas II is a representative of
a strong empire and this canonization would be a canonization of a
strong empire, not of Nicholas II only,'' said Edvard S. Radzinsky,
author of ``The Life and Death of Nicholas II'' (Doubleday, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   As president Putin has demonstrated some loyalty to the Russian
church. One of his first public appearances as acting president was
at Christmas services in January at the Cathedral of Christ the
Savior, where the council is being held and where the canonization
service will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 860 canonized were clergymen and church workers killed
in 1937 and 1938, the worst years of persecution of the church. In
1937, 136,900 churchmen were arrested and 85,300 were executed by
the NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB Of the 28,300 arrested in
1938, 21,500 were shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas II and his family have, in fact, been canonized before,
by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, in New York City,
which canonized the Romanovs as martyrs. But the New York church
does not acknowledge the Russian church and itself is not
recognized by other Orthodox churches. But many believers in Russia
admired its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially divisive debate over the imperial family was
predicted before the bishops' council opened on Sunday. Two icons
of the new saints were reportedly prepared, one with the czar and
his family, and one without their images.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore must
walk on to the platform at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and
give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Success, as he accepts the Democratic nomination, will keep him
in the presidential race with a sporting chance of winning. Failure
could spell the beginning of the end of his political career, at
52.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, Gore must parry the attacks _ overt and implied _
from the platform of the Republican Convention two weeks ago, but
he must also present himself as a party leader and
president-in-waiting, a superior alternative to George W. Bush and
his well-drilled, seemingly moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The last is perhaps the simplest. The policy ideas set out by
Bush left gaping holes just waiting for the Democratic nominee to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, pensions, low pay and the environment, as well as
reform of the business-dominated system of political funding, are
areas of public concern that Gore can usefully exploit.
</P>
<P>
   He can claim a share of the credit for the U.S.'s longest period
of economic expansion and cite his eight years' White House
experience to support his claim to be a better steward of the
country's prosperity into the future.
</P>
<P>
   He can also upstage Bush's boast of leading a diverse and
inclusive party by having named Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew,
as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But Gore's weaknesses lie less in content than
in manner and character. From his earliest years as a congressman
from Tennessee, even his supporters had nagging doubts about the
mismatch between the scale of his ambition and his political and
intellectual abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Having attained his party's presidential nomination after two
failed attempts, he must now show that there is genuine substance
beneath the exaggerated ardor or anger he often displays in his
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows he has experience; what they question is whether
he has the spine to take the hard decisions and the insight to read
the nation's mood.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's intellectual caliber, compared with that of
Bush anyway, is not at issue; his political sensitivity and his
ability to connect with the voters are.
</P>
<P>
   While described universally as delightful and even funny in
private, Gore lacks Bush's charm in public. It may be that the
presence of his running mate, the far more relaxed and even
garrulous Lieberman, will loosen him up.
</P>
<P>
   But unless he can make up in gravitas and honesty what he lacks
in charisma, Gore will fare badly by comparison with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas, though, is not the only, or even the most
threatening, point of comparison. In Los Angeles, Gore has somehow
to emerge from the giant shadow of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Making the move from vice president to presidential nominee is
always problematical, but Clinton has given Gore an even harder job
than Ronald Reagan gave George Bush senior in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Both two-term presidents had an exceptional talent for
communicating and an uncanny sense of the national mood. Like Bush
with Reagan, Gore will never match Clinton: he lacks his personal
magnetism, political instinct and quickness of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gore is worse off than Bush, however, is in the issue of
ethics. Clinton bequeaths to Gore the fallout from White House
sleaze and his own scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Against that, Gore can set the solidity of his family. The
choice of Lieberman, one of Clinton's earliest critics in the
Lewinsky affair, has given him one degree of separation. Clinton's
own new apology last week gave him another.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is not without ethical burdens of his own: his
hesitation about condemning Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky is one;
the legality of his fund-raising and his equivocation about it is
another. Somehow he must allay voters' doubts on these scores.
</P>
<P>
   While planned to look less slick than the Republicans'
song-and-dance show of unity and moderation, the Democratic
Convention has been no less choreographed, and to one end alone:
portraying Al Gore as president-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, Bill and Hillary, will address the convention
Monday and then leave the West Coast altogether.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no joint Clinton-Gore fund-raising or platform
appearance. The remaining three nights will see the progressive
reintroduction of Al Gore: family man, caring politician, national
leader. &QL;

<P>
   Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano, Italy, where
Prime Minister Tony Blair has been holidaying in his borrowed
Tuscan fortress, are half a dozen Italian towns that are trying to
slow down the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of ``Slow City'' movement, where towns sign up
to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and hence more
enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 32 towns in Italy that have joined the scheme,
which grew out of the ``Slow Food'' plan of the early Eighties.
That was a reaction to Americanized fast food, the idea being that
people should eat delicious meals, and take all afternoon doing it,
instead of bolting down a hamburger on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   These Slow Cities are coping with traffic by enlarging
pedestrian areas and building car parking lots on the edge. They
are planting more trees in parks, banning car alarms, and taking
down TV aerials, posters and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   If you detect a tinge of anti-Americanism, even xenophobia, in
all this you would be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American urban model,'' protests Paolo Saturnini, the
mayor of Greve in Chianti (just 30 miles from San Gimignano), ``has
invaded our cities and risks making Italian towns look the same. We
want to stop this kind of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of anti-globalization in these include banning
genetically-modified foods and promoting locally produced organic
food in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But these cities are not against progress in the sense that they
are anti-technology; in fact they argue that technology, properly
applied, ought to make life easier and more relaxed. They are, so
to speak, anti-McDonald's rather than anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would applaud the idea, but short of high-tailing it
to Tuscany, what can we do about it? In any case, going slow while
on vacation is not the problem for most of us: it is how to slow
down our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Cities project touches a nerve because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time:
between the time-rich and the time-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some time-richness is involuntary: that of the unemployed or the
early retired. And some of the time-poor have chosen to be that
way: whatever they might say, they regard being busy as a sign of
status.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do
we get our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations,
have fun, and still find time to slope about doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   We will all have our own ideas, but the Slow Cities movement
can, I suggest, teach us some principles of how we might do so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of the slowing down is not so much slowing,
but calming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key aspects of the Italian cities' plan is to cut
down on noise _ understandably in view of the Vespa/mobile phone
culture of the Italian young.
</P>
<P>
   This holds a lesson for us here. While we cannot do anything
about the booming stereo in the next car at the traffic lights, we
can create more calm by not inflicting noise on ourselves when we
don't need to. Turn down the telly. Throw out the Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   But while cutting down on noise may help take pressure off
people, it doesn't solve the time problem. How do we create more
downtime for ourselves? Everyone will have lots of tricks they have
learned that enable them to save time.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trawl of my colleagues suggests the following ideas. One
is to do the weekly supermarket shopping at 8 a.m. on a Saturday
morning when you can whisk around in half the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   A second is, whenever you see an object that would make a good
present, to buy it and stick it in a drawer. Then you have presents
ready for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, doing things at the last minute is also very
efficient. There was some economic study that looked at the time
taken to do routine tasks: the closer it was to the deadline, the
quicker the task was done.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist I found the last idea particularly encouraging.
But I would like to offer two further suggestions. One takes a lot
of organization, costs money and is not an option for everyone; the
other can be done instantly by anyone and is free.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to cut commuting time. The sums are simple. On a
typical working day, we spend eight hours at work and eight hours
asleep. So that leaves only eight hours for everything else _ from
brushing one's teeth to making sure the fridge is stocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you then use another hour each way of that time commuting,
you have used up one-quarter of all the spare time during the day.
Given frequent traffic delays and the unreliability of public
transport, this is an enormous burden we place on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much a modern burden: the word commuter is only
about 130 years old. Nearly all the additional time we gained in
the last century by shorter working hours, we lost in longer
commuting time.
</P>
<P>
   By a combination of living close to work (or working close to
where you live) and using the new technologies to do at least some
work at home, it should be possible for many people to trim the
time they spend going to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who has just sold his apartment and is borrowing one
closer to our offices says he is astounded by the amount of time he
has suddenly discovered he has gained.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, not everyone has this option. The option that we
do all have can gain even more time. It is to give up watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Social Trends, the average man in
Britain spends 24 hours a week watching television, the average
woman 26 hours. That is between three and four hours a day _ all of
which has to come out of the eight hours of leisure. No wonder
people feel they have no time.
</P>
<P>
   Are you out of touch if you don't watch the box? Not if you
listen to the radio and read the newspapers. Put a tablecloth over
it for a week and see what happens. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps Tony Blair should try that one. If he vowed never to
watch TV and simply paid his PR people to watch it for him, think
of the time he could save.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he should pop over to Greve and have a beer with the
mayor. Don't hurry. Get one of those squads of bodyguards to do the
driving. Stop off at Castellina in Chianti on the way back and have
another beer. And reflect on the fact that is one of the things
vacations are for: to get new ideas on how to make life more
pleasant when you get back home. &QL;

TORRICELLI, CHASTENED, ACTS AS UNIFIER 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. Robert Torricelli, in perhaps the most
improbable speech of his two-decade career, conceded Monday to New
Jersey delegates who are here for the Democratic National
Convention that he had misjudged their support in trying to usurp
Jim McGreevey's place as the party's likely candidate for governor
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli is here almost as dual personas. He is both the
powerful New Jersey senator who heads the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee and flits from one big-ticket gala to another,
and the chastened New Jersey politician whose bid for the party's
Democratic nomination for governor turned out to be a humiliating
dud.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli did not apologize for the divisions he had created
before withdrawing from the race on July 31, nor for the difficult
decisions he had forced many officials to make. Nor did he endorse
McGreevey. But he nonetheless asked Democrats to unify behind the
party's candidates this November before taking up the 2001
governor's race again. And in an uncharacteristically self-effacing
way, Torricelli suggested that he had accepted his defeat, and was
ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed that,'' Torricelli said when greeted with a standing
ovation, adding later that it had nearly moved him to tears.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was off to four receptions (out of 29 this week
that he said should raise $4 million for Democratic Senate
candidates), a short speech on the convention floor, and another
night of party-hopping. And on Tuesday night, Torricelli is to be
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's guest of honor at
Spago, the ultimate Los Angeles party place.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago it looked as if this week would also be the
moment of Torricelli's ascension to the throne of New Jersey
politics: his coronation as nominee for the governorship he has
coveted for years. Instead, it is McGreevey who is meeting with
governors and constituency groups here, burnishing his image on the
issues and laying the groundwork to raise as much as $20 million
for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, speaking to hundreds of New Jerseyans at their hotel
in Glendale, was applauded when he declared that Republicans from
Gov. Christie Whitman to the leaders of the state Legislature
``have simply lost the right to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was greeted warmly when he said that Democrats needed to
pull together to heal wounds that he seemed to acknowledge he had
helped to deepen. ``There is no reason for this political party in
the state of New Jersey to have any divisions of region, or
ideology, or personality,'' he said. ``We can all have our
differences about who would lead us best, win by the widest margins
or achieve victory. ``I had my own view,'' he added, eliciting
laughter at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite Torricelli's talk of unity, and the standing ovation
his mention of McGreevey received, it was clear Monday that many
who supported Torricelli's candidacy for governor remained
lukewarm, at best, about McGreevey. Some said Torricelli's original
argument _ that McGreevey did not have the electoral heft to sweep
other Democrats into office _ remained persuasive. ``My concern is
the need to elect a Democratic Assembly and Senate,'' said Joseph
Doria, the Assembly minority leader and would-be speaker. ``We need
the coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of McGreevey's supporters continued to speak
disparagingly _ albeit on the condition of anonymity _ of
Torricelli's political future.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Torricelli said Monday that he would run for a
second term in 2002. But he said he had given up his gubernatorial
ambitions for good. ``That moment has passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the damage his image has sustained in New Jersey since
last month, his high profile in Los Angeles gives little indication
that he has been diminished on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who had named Torricelli
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said
Torricelli had not lost any esteem among his colleagues. ``I was
glad he made a decision to stay in the Senate, because he's an
outstanding leader and he has a bright future there,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Torricelli's failure in New Jersey was noticed nationally,
nonetheless. One prominent Democratic lawyer attending a
fund-raiser in Santa Monica on Sunday observed that most
politicians interested in running for higher office would float a
trial balloon first, to avoid embarrassment. ``Torricelli floated a
very large and incendiary device,'' the lawyer said. ``He floated
the Hindenburg, and he was a passenger on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who has long feuded with
Torricelli, suggested in an interview that his rival's brief
candidacy for governor had not been well received in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in New Jersey, we're facing a significant opportunity to
keep a Democrat in the Senate, to help Al Gore get elected with a
significant plurality, everyone knows that we have to do it in
concert,'' Lautenberg said. ``So it's noted outside when a
disruption comes along that is fundamentally divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, inadvertently, it had a good outcome, because it pulled
Democrats together as nothing we've seen in the last four or five
years,'' Lautenberg added. ``And Jim McGreevey is stronger for
it.''

   So far there are 32 towns in Italy that have joined the scheme,
which grew out of the ``Slow Food'' plan of the early Eighties.
That was a reaction to Americanized fast food, the idea being that
people should eat delicious meals, and take all afternoon doing it,
instead of bolting down a hamburger on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   These Slow Cities are coping with traffic by enlarging
pedestrian areas and building car parking lots on the edge. They
are planting more trees in parks, banning car alarms, and taking
down TV aerials, posters and neon signs.

<P>
   If you detect a tinge of anti-Americanism, even xenophobia, in
all this you would be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American urban model,'' protests Paolo Saturnini, the
mayor of Greve in Chianti (just 30 miles from San Gimignano), ``has
invaded our cities and risks making Italian towns look the same. We
want to stop this kind of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of anti-globalization in these include banning
genetically-modified foods and promoting locally produced organic
food in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But these cities are not against progress in the sense that they
are anti-technology; in fact they argue that technology, properly
applied, ought to make life easier and more relaxed. They are, so
to speak, anti-McDonald's rather than anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would applaud the idea, but short of high-tailing it
to Tuscany, what can we do about it? In any case, going slow while
on vacation is not the problem for most of us: it is how to slow
down our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Cities project touches a nerve because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time:
between the time-rich and the time-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some time-richness is involuntary: that of the unemployed or the
early retired. And some of the time-poor have chosen to be that
way: whatever they might say, they regard being busy as a sign of
status.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do
we get our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations,
have fun, and still find time to slope about doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   We will all have our own ideas, but the Slow Cities movement
can, I suggest, teach us some principles of how we might do so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of the slowing down is not so much slowing,
but calming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key aspects of the Italian cities' plan is to cut
down on noise _ understandably in view of the Vespa/mobile phone
culture of the Italian young.
</P>
<P>
   This holds a lesson for us here. While we cannot do anything
about the booming stereo in the next car at the traffic lights, we
can create more calm by not inflicting noise on ourselves when we
don't need to. Turn down the telly. Throw out the Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   But while cutting down on noise may help take pressure off
people, it doesn't solve the time problem. How do we create more
downtime for ourselves? Everyone will have lots of tricks they have
learned that enable them to save time.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trawl of my colleagues suggests the following ideas. One
is to do the weekly supermarket shopping at 8 a.m. on a Saturday
morning when you can whisk around in half the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   A second is, whenever you see an object that would make a good
present, to buy it and stick it in a drawer. Then you have presents
ready for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, doing things at the last minute is also very
efficient. There was some economic study that looked at the time
taken to do routine tasks: the closer it was to the deadline, the
quicker the task was done.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist I found the last idea particularly encouraging.
But I would like to offer two further suggestions. One takes a lot
of organization, costs money and is not an option for everyone; the
other can be done instantly by anyone and is free.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to cut commuting time. The sums are simple. On a
typical working day, we spend eight hours at work and eight hours
asleep. So that leaves only eight hours for everything else _ from
brushing one's teeth to making sure the fridge is stocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you then use another hour each way of that time commuting,
you have used up one-quarter of all the spare time during the day.
Given frequent traffic delays and the unreliability of public
transport, this is an enormous burden we place on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much a modern burden: the word commuter is only
about 130 years old. Nearly all the additional time we gained in
the last century by shorter working hours, we lost in longer
commuting time.
</P>
<P>
   By a combination of living close to work (or working close to
where you live) and using the new technologies to do at least some
work at home, it should be possible for many people to trim the
time they spend going to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who has just sold his apartment and is borrowing one
closer to our offices says he is astounded by the amount of time he
has suddenly discovered he has gained.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, not everyone has this option. The option that we
do all have can gain even more time. It is to give up watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Social Trends, the average man in
Britain spends 24 hours a week watching television, the average
woman 26 hours. That is between three and four hours a day _ all of
which has to come out of the eight hours of leisure. No wonder
people feel they have no time.
</P>
<P>
   Are you out of touch if you don't watch the box? Not if you
listen to the radio and read the newspapers. Put a tablecloth over
it for a week and see what happens. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps Tony Blair should try that one. If he vowed never to
watch TV and simply paid his PR people to watch it for him, think
of the time he could save.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he should pop over to Greve and have a beer with the
mayor. Don't hurry. Get one of those squads of bodyguards to do the
driving. Stop off at Castellina in Chianti on the way back and have
another beer. And reflect on the fact that is one of the things
vacations are for: to get new ideas on how to make life more
pleasant when you get back home. &QL;

 BEHIND THE SCENES: BRENTWOOD, BUNNIES AND BARBRA By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everybody wanted to go behind the scenes Monday at
the Democratic National Convention, at least during the long hours
before President Clinton's address. (Tom Brokaw described it as
``the political equivalent of Elvis's last concert.'')
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you looked on television or on the World Wide Web,
people were promising to take you backstage, past the security
guards, beyond the tall hedges of those Brentwood estates where the
glitterati were celebrating their wonderfulness and where,
presumably, all the really juicy stuff was going on. But if
Monday's reports are any indication, the convention is a lot like
Hollywood, with nothing behind the scenery but plywood, sawdust and
a snoozing gaffer.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal, on its Web page, followed Rod O'Connor,
the convention's chief operating officer and ``a moving target for
favor seekers of all sorts.'' O'Connor's day began at 8 a.m., with
a staff meeting at the Staples Center. At 8:45, he and the
communications staff discussed the message of the day. At 9:15,
there was the first official media briefing, and the whining began.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor promised to help smooth the ``check-in-crush'' of
journalists waiting to get into the convention. At 10 a.m., he was
cornered by a staff member from Speakout.com, which was upset about
its placement in the media center. At 11:15 a.m., meeting with the
hall management staff in the Los Angeles Lakers' dressing room,
O'Connor had to figure out how to get more local media people onto
the podium, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a another staff meeting, O'Connor had to parcel out
skyboxes for opening night. ``Let's give B-3 to the mayor,'' he
decided. His cell phone rang. A major campaign donor wanted more
tickets to Thursday night. O'Connor made soothing noises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the whole business of the convention here,'' he told
the National Journal. ``You try to sift out what people really need
as opposed to what they'd like to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention got under way with speeches that were noticeably
more partisan than those that characterized the first two days of
the recent Republican event. ``We have something we can argue
about,'' the Clinton strategist James Carville told MSNBC. ``I
think that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The pugnacious theme continued into the evening when Fox News
decided to roam the convention floor and chat with some actual
delegates. One teacher from Michigan was found carrying around a
cardboard cut-out of Elvis that he hoped to get President Clinton
to autograph. ``Elvis is alive and well in Michigan, as is
education,'' said the delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web pages featured their Hollywood party reports,
promising to take us into those exclusive enclaves. Long gone,
apparently, are the days when starlets jumped nude into the
swimming pool while Errol Flynn got into a fistfight at the bar.
Yes, the reports were filled with bold-faced names and the sound of
champagne corks popping, but there was a noticeable scarcity of
juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats' deft decision to hold this week's extravaganza
in the heart of Los Angeles has given the party scene an almost
mythical quality as the nation's top political bigwigs connect with
some of Hollywood's hottest celebrities,'' wrote Molly M. Peterson
for the Hotline's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Almost mythical, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Friedman, the gossip columnist for Fox News, praised
Barbra Streisand's lavish Malibu compound, where Democrats with
thick wallets were gathered Sunday to donate $5 million to
President Clinton's presidential library. But, there was some
discontent beneath the surface, he reported. Some of the fat cats
were upset that Streisand did not favor them with a song. (``Good
dirt, Roger,'' the anchorwoman enthused.)
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's Jeannette Walls went to a party at the Playboy mansion
and found that some of the well-known names in attendance did not
wish to be photographed in such a place. And the bunnies were
off-limits, too. ``These girls are working,'' beefy security guards
warned reporters. ``They're not here to be interviewed. They're
here to mingle with the guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, the screenwriter of ``Showgirls'' and
best-selling author of ``American Rhapsody,'' wrote in Salon.com
that Hollywood was of two minds about the nomination of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, a well-known critic of violence and sex in movies, as
Vice President Al Gore's running mate. Should they shun him for
fear of their livelihoods, or embrace him as better than a
Republican? ``This was a quandary worse than whether to pay Adam
Sandler 20 mill for his next picture,'' Eszterhas explained.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Monday afternoon on CNN's ``Talk Back Live,''
Eszterhas joined a panel fussing over whether Hollywood was going
to dominate the convention and the campaign. Cynical views abounded
from all points of the political spectrum, though none were able to
match the levels of cynicism exhibited by the people whose e-mail
messages are regular features of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians will take money from whoever will give it to
them,'' one cyber-citizen opined. ``It's the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pleaded, ``Stop glorifying these egomaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg of CNN decided that the Democratic convention
was structured pretty much like the Republican one, to deflect
attention from each party's weak points. ``Democrats gathering in
Los Angeles are being treated to a strong dose of religion,
morality and character,'' Rothenberg wrote. ``Welcome to Bizarro
World, where each party addresses its weaknesses and hopes to
neutralize its opponents' advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   So pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. It's just
another day in Bizarro World.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever you do, don't go near the bunnies.

to the tumultuous Bay Area media landscape Monday by agreeing to
buy KBHK (Channel 44).

   The San Francisco TV station, a UPN affiliate that airs popular

 &UR; WELLS _  &LR; Wells Fargo, a pioneer lender to California's low-income

advocacy group that questioned Wells' commitment to those
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The California Reinvestment Committee, a coalition of more than
200 groups across the state, issued a statement Monday warning that
a recent shakeup of Wells' California community development
operations signals a ``downgrading'' of the bank's lending and
investment activities in low-income neighborhoods.  &UR; BY &LR;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Walter was a street cat, a ``pusseini baladi'' as they
say in Beirut, brown and black with sharp ears and sharper teeth _
the only creature of its kind to consume part of an Israeli
wire-guided air-to-ground missile.
</P>
<P>
   On warm evenings, she would sit on the balcony and survey the
seafront Corniche, the coffee stalls and the Mediterranean as it
lapped idly against the green rocks below.
</P>
<P>
   She occasionally appeared in the pages of the Independent, not
least when it seemed certain that our seafront highway was to be
renamed Boulevard du President Hafez el-Assad after the Syrian
leader. This extraordinary honor eventually went to a road near the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   As a kitten, Walter liked the sofa, even at the height of
General Aoun's lunatic bombardment of West Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Walter?, we would ask every time the shells started to
hiss over the house. I found her once, still sitting on the sofa,
following with her eyes the lights of the tracers and targeting
rounds as they flitted over the rooftop. One tough puss.
</P>
<P>
   The missile wire? Well back in 1993, in Israel's week-long
bombardment of southern Lebanon, I came across the guidance-wire of
a missile that had exploded in a truck. The wire interested me
because I suspected it may have been manufactured in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So I took back around six feet of the brass cable and laid it on
my desk prior to sending it off to the Independent's defense
correspondent for examination. Which is where Walter found it one
afternoon. And ate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missile wire?!'' the vet's wife shrieked in terror. Her
husband, Dr. Musri, saved Walter's life. Liquid paraffin was poured
into the beast and _ within hours _ the wire emerged from the wrong
end of Walter. I spared our defense correspondent what was left.
</P>
<P>
   Walter shrugged it off and returned to her favorite game _
playing with toy mice. Indeed, she enjoyed this so much that when a
real live mouse walked up the side of the balcony one day and
trotted across the floor past Walter's feet, she merely yawned.
</P>
<P>
   But she was a journalistic cat. She would snuggle down on
winter's evenings in my office, perched on top of copies of that
venerable old Lebanese journal ``L'Orient Le Jour,'' the only
newspaper to be written in Royalist French.
</P>
<P>
   Or sit like a teapot on the top of the UPS, the Uninterrupted
Power Supply system that every computer in Lebanon needs as a
backup when Netanyahu or Barak bomb the country's power stations.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion Walter walked across the telephone and pressed
the automatic re-dial. I found her standing beside the machine with
a puzzled look as journalist John Cooley's voice crackled down the
line from Cyprus to demand why the caller was refusing to talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Walter could strike anywhere. And the old telex machine _ yes, I
was still filing on telex until the '90s _ became a bed for Walter,
its constantly running motor warming her underside night after
night, the messages from the Independent repeatedly garbled as the
paper messages _ unable to escape Walter's furry bulk _ hopelessly
overprinted.
</P>
<P>
   When I was punching telex tape, she would attack the tape,
ripping the holes with her claws.
</P>
<P>
   She could not escape journalism. And journalism couldn't escape
Walter.
</P>
<P>
   She was even named after a newspaper editor: Walter Wells of the
International Herald Tribune in Paris whose gutless refusal to
defend my journalist wife after the U.S. military lied about an
article she wrote for the paper prompted us to commemorate the
event in style.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a Gulf war or southern Lebanon or Ireland, Walter
would always be there, waiting for her evening can of Whiskers in
the room where we stored the spare fuel for the generator.
</P>
<P>
   But when she went off her food in May, even the great Dr. Musri
could not find out what was wrong. Walter stopped purring and
skulked under a chair in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a week without food, I bundled her into her basket
and flew to Paris where two veterinarians were waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   She sat meekly in her basket on the floor of Club Class. ``What
a well-behaved cat,'' the head of the Hariri Foundation charity
remarked from the neighboring seat. Neither of us knew that Walter
was dying.
</P>
<P>
   She had an enlarged heart, myocardia they said, and water on the
lungs was preventing her from eating. They drained the water and
for a few days Walter was back munching roast chicken. Then she
suffered a blood clot and the young female doctor said that she
might go into convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end. It took a few seconds for Walter to go limp and
an hour to cremate her. Under French law, her ashes had to remain
unscattered for a year and a day.
</P>
<P>
   But we broke the law and brought what was left of Walter back to
Beirut. And where the waves lap the green rocks below the house, we
threw her ashes, into the sea she watched so often and in which
live the fish she ate so many times.
</P>
<P>
   But I should have guessed that Walter's presence had not gone.
Not long after our return from Paris, the UPS started smoking as
the fan stopped at the back of the machine and everything I need as
a correspondent _ computer, phone re-charger, fax machine, printer
_ abruptly stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese technician lugged the heavy iron box away, only to
return hours later with a mass of brown and black fur in his hand.
``You have a cat?'' he asked. ``There was about a ton of fur
clogging the fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter had struck again. &QL;

 BLUELIGHT.COM TO GET $80 MILLION IN FINANCING  &HT;     By KELLY YAMANOUCHI 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bluelight.com, the high-profile Internet
subsidiary of Kmart Corp., said Monday that it has secured $80
million in second-round financing in one of the year's largest
e-tailing financing packages.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart, a co-founder of Bluelight.com, will provide $55 million
in additional financing while Japanese Internet investor Softbank
Inc. is chipping in $25 million. The funds will go toward Web site
development, marketing, hiring and inventory for the San Francisco
dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which offers about 100,000 products including DVD
players and Lego toy sets, expects to carry 500,000 products by
mid-October. That will be more than what is available at a typical
Kmart store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect break-even operating conditions toward the end of
next year,'' said Bluelight.com Chief Financial Officer Christopher
Lein.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100 employees and 3.3 million Internet service
subscribers, Bluelight.com has grown rapidly since its Web site was
launched in December. The question, however, is how many of these
customers will stick with Bluelight.com, according to Andrew
Bartels, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Bluelight.com faces stiff competition from Wal-Mart, which has
joined forces with America Online Inc. to offer low-cost Internet
service. In addition, the Kmart unit must contend with other free
Internet service providers and e-tailers.

 LINUX ENJOYING ENTHUSIASTIC GROWTH  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, opening to the
public Tuesday in San Jose, Calif., is the largest trade show
devoted to the cooperatively developed, freely distributed Linux
computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the show, The Chronicle asked Bob Young, chairman
of Red Hat Inc., the largest Linux distributor, to assess the
progress of the OS and the movement behind it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: The popularity of Linux seems to be soaring. How do you
explain that?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Young: What open-source software does that proprietary technology
does not is to give users control, for the first time, over the
technology they're being asked to invest in. And that's what's
creating all of this enthusiasm. When you go to user group
meetings, when you talk to MIS directors at General Motors, the
enthusiasm across the spectrum for open-source technologies, for
things like Linux, is that they're no longer beholden to their
vendor.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietary, binary-only model that the software industry
has used to date (the standard system of shipping software users
can't modify) leaves the vendor in control of the vendor-customer
relationship, and we think that's a fundamental flaw.
</P>
<P>
   We ask people, ``Would you buy a car with the hood welded
shut?'' If the hood was welded shut in such a way that the only way
you could get things fixed was to take it back to the original
dealer, then the original dealer is in control of the car.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if he refuses to fix the bug that's causing your
car to stall every few hundred miles, you're stuck _ you'd learn to
live with restarting your car every few hundred miles, the same
principle as rebooting your computer once a day.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of being able to open the hood of your car is, if
the original dealer can't figure out what's causing your car to
stall, you've got 10,000 other dealers across the country who are
happy to help.
</P>
<P>
   In the software business, with binary-only products, the only
people who can fix them are Oracle or MS or Symantec or whoever
sold it to you. And if they deny that the thing causing your system
to crash is a bug, where do you go?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: In what markets are people buying into that argument?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Young: Broadly, you've got three markets: first, the server
marketplace _ database servers, Internet servers and so on; second,
the classic desktop machine market, which Windows dominates; and
then the embedded system market, things like easy-to-use Internet
appliances, TV set-top boxes, Internet-enabled phones and so on.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is that all of the growth in the future of
the IT industry, according to Gartner Group, is occurring in the
first and third of those markets. The middle piece, the stand-alone
Windows environment, is 1980s technology and it's a big market,
it's not going anywhere soon, but it's no longer a growing market.
</P>
<P>
   Our success is not dependent on getting people to unplug their
working Windows desktop. Our opportunity is the rapid growth that's
occurring on Internet servers talking to Internet appliances. We
are perfectly positioned to serve both of those markets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: How are you doing in those markets at this point?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Young: International Data Corp.'s numbers show that 24 percent of
the server operating systems shipped last year were Linux. It was
the only OS that had a growing share _ the year before, Linux
represented about 16 percent, and the year before that just 6
percent. So the growth rate is quite dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet appliance side, well, it's going to be massive.
And with the agreements we've had with companies like Ericsson and
Nortel, Red Hat Linux technology is going to be in a huge
percentage of those appliances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chronicle: You don't see any chance that Linux could become a real
alternative to Windows for mainstream PC users?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Young: My point isn't that that isn't an important market and
someone shouldn't go after it _ I'm glad some Linux companies are.
All I'm getting at is, that's not the future of the IT industry.
Back in the early days, when we were working out of an old
apartment in Durham (North Carolina), the conversation would get
around to ``Jeez, there's four or five of us living off our credit
cards trying to compete with Microsoft _ who are we trying to
kid?''
</P>
<P>
   But John ``Mad Dog'' Hall (now head of Linux International, a
nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the OS) always used
to say, ``Guys, remember, there are 6 billion people in the world.
Your job isn't to look after the 400 million personal computers,
your job is to build the technology that the other 5.6 billion
people will use.''

 INVESTORS YAWN AT CHIRON'S $700 MILLION DEAL  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chiron Corp. agreed to pay $700 million in cash
Monday to buy a Seattle biotech firm with one drug on the market
and a research pipeline geared toward creating antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, however, seemed underwhelmed by Chiron's
acquisition of PathoGenesis Corp., the manufacturer of TOBI, an
inhalable antibiotic to treat chronic lung infections arising from
cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron shares slipped 4 percent to close at $46.69 after
Monday's premarket announcement of the deal. Analysts had long
chided Chiron for being slow to use its $1 billion cash hoard to
make a big purchase, and initial reaction was that the PathoGenesis
deal just wasn't big enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors had hoped Chiron would do something larger than
this,'' said Dennis Harp, who follows Chiron for Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron Chief Financial Officer Jim Sulat predicted that Wall
Street would warm up to the deal once Chiron explains why it will
pay $38.50 per share for PathoGenesis, an 18 percent premium over
that firm's closing price of $32.75 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sulat said Chiron is confident that TOBI, which is worth $80
million a year in U.S. sales, has the prospect for generating new
markets in Europe, where the drug is in the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   He said Chiron also is convinced PathoGenesis is poised to
develop antibiotics by using genetic data on microbes to fashion
drugs tailor-made toward diseases such as tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sulat said, PathoGenesis has expertise in designing
drugs that can be inhaled, an advantage in targeting pulmonary
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron was so impressed with PathoGenesis' research expertise
that the two companies signed a deal last year to share technology
for using genomic data to target microbes. PathoGenesis chief
executive Bill Glantz said that from the start, Chiron chief
executive Sean Lance hinted that Chiron had more than a partnership
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very persistent,'' Glantz said of Lance. ``He was very
clear about where he wanted this relationship to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until June, however, when PathoGenesis hired an
investment banking firm to shop the company around, that the
acquisition talks moved to the front burner. Glantz said he
entertained one other firm bid for PathoGenesis before accepting
Chiron's all-cash offer.
</P>
<P>
   Glantz founded PathoGenesis in 1992 with Bruce Montgomery, a
former scientist with Genentech Inc. who had worked on that firm's
cystic fibrosis effort. After Glantz and Montgomery established
PathoGenesis' research offices in Seattle, the firm moved
relatively quickly to launch TOBI in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But PathoGenesis overestimated the market for the new
cystic-fibrosis compound at around $100 million, and after trading
above $45 a share in 1999, the stock crashed when investors saw
initial U.S. sales more in the neighborhood of $60 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Glantz said PathoGenesis shares were trading around $18 in June
when the board decided the company had reached a turning point. On
the one hand, it was poised to broaden the market for TOBI in
Europe, but to capture European sales, it would have to spend
millions to build a sales force.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was to hang out the ``for sale'' sign, which the
company did when it announced that it had hired bankers to
``explore strategic options.'' The company's stock began to rise,
culminating with Monday's $700 million buyout announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron's Sulat said his company planned to retain most of
PathoGenesis' 320 employees, who are split between research offices
in Seattle and a manufacturing facility in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any head-count reductions will be incidental,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both
companies, is expected to close in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of PathoGenesis rose 16 percent to close at $37.97 on the
news.

 WELLS FARGO'S LENDING POLICIES ASSAILED  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wells Fargo, a pioneer lender to California's
low-income and minority neighborhoods, has come under fire from a
leading advocacy group that questioned Wells' commitment to those
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The California Reinvestment Committee, a coalition of more than
200 groups across the state, issued a statement Monday warning that
a recent shakeup of Wells' California community development
operations signals a ``downgrading'' of the bank's lending and
investment activities in low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The committee called on the Federal Reserve to hold public
hearings on Wells' pending takeover of First Security Corp., the
largest bank in Utah, so that community groups can air their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' reorganization of its community development department
``suggests that the bank is placing less importance on the needs of
low-income communities in California,'' said Alan Fisher, the
committee's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The bank countered that the reorganization is aimed at
strengthening community lending operations. ``We've actually
upgraded our (community reinvestment) function,'' spokesman Larry
Haeg said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy reflects the different lending philosophies of
the old Wells and Minnesota's Norwest, which bought the San
Francisco bank a year and a half ago, took its name and moved its
headquarters west.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators gave both banks strong marks for their programs to
finance low-income communities. While the old Wells set up a
powerful, centralized department to oversee its community lending
activities, Norwest assigned the responsibility to its regional
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Karen Wegmann, the longtime community
development manager of the old Wells, retired. Under her, the bank
had forged strong ties with advocacy groups, signing formal
agreements to lend billions to low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   Wells used Wegmann's departure as an opportunity to put in place
in California the decentralized community lending model of the old
Norwest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a statewide community development organization, Wells
created separate staff operations reporting to each of five
regional presidents. The bank named longtime Wells veteran Timothy
Hanlon to replace Wegmann but took away his line authority over the
community development staff.
</P>
<P>
   Community development isn't a full-time job for Hanlon, as it
was for Wegmann. In addition to the development area, he is still
responsible for the bank's charitable, minority vendor and
volunteer programs in California.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization puts the development staff closer to
communities and makes it easier for the bank to respond to the
specific problems of each region, Wells spokesman Haeg said.
</P>
<P>
   But community groups say it will be difficult for the bank to
put together a consistent program and be accountable for what's
happening in each region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is up in the air,'' said Arthi Varma, a California
Reinvestment Committee staff member. ``We don't know who to go to,
who to talk with.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, activists in the Northwest, Midwest and Northeast are
criticizing Wells' home lending record in public comments on the
bank's proposed First Security purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' mortgage company denies loans to African American and
Latino applicants at a much higher frequency than white applicants,
the groups have charged.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wells' units that charge above-market rates to
borrowers with weak credit records lend disproportionately to
minorities. The disparity is more than the industry average, the
groups charged.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said its lending record is solid. ``We have been named
as the No. 1 lender to people of color and second-leading lender to
low- and moderate-income home buyers,'' Haeg said.

 SIGABA SOFTWARE SEEKS TO EASE PARANOIA ABOUT E-MAIL  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Mateo, Calif., startup Sigaba Corp. couldn't
buy better marketing than the kind the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is giving to it for free.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that the FBI has been using a powerful system
called Carnivore to monitor peoples' e-mail has driven home a point
that encryption advocates have been repeating for years: E-mail is
not private. Messages can easily be read by Internet service
providers, the FBI or hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sigaba launches a free product on its Web site ( &LR; www. &LR; 
 &LR; sigaba.com &LR; ) designed to make it easy for ordinary people to send
encrypted e-mail that can't be intercepted by Carnivore or anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnivore has been very beneficial for us,'' said Richard
Bliss, Sigaba marketing vice president. ``People have been shocked
into the realization that their mail is not secret when they send
it across the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The product, SigabaSecure, also makes it possible to take back
an e-mail after it has been sent _ a function that will probably
save users embarrassment if they ever accidentally send a message
to someone it's not intended for. The function, called
``shredding,'' works by destroying the key that the e-mail
recipient would use to decode the message. Shredding is possible up
until the receiver decodes and opens the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Sigaba is one of several companies benefiting from the public's
heightened awareness of e-mail's vulnerability. ZixIt of Dallas
recently introduced a product that allows users to send encrypted
e-mail through ZixIt's Web site,  &LR; www.securedelivery.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Both Sigaba and ZixIt are marketing to individual consumers,
banking on the fact that while several encryption products on the
market are capable of keeping prying eyes off e-mail, consumers
have mostly ignored them. The problem is that the products are too
complicated for most people to use.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a Carnegie Mellon study, ``Why Johnny Can't
Encrypt,'' illustrated this problem by giving 12 people copies of
one of the easier-to-use encryption programs, PGP 5.0. The
participants were instructed to send several encrypted e-mails, but
half the group failed.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption programs typically have had difficult-to-use
interfaces, and some require users to set up a special e-mail
account just for encrypted messages. But the biggest problem with
past security products is their use of a system called public key
infrastructure, said Eric Arnum, editor of Messaging Online
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   PKI makes digital signatures possible, but it can also be used
to send encrypted e-mail. However, some experts such as Arnum say
PKI and e-mail are not a good match.
</P>
<P>
   With PKI, an e-mail's code has two keys: one for encoding and
one for decoding. The encoding key is posted on a company server or
an individual's Web page; it is called the public key. The decoding
key is kept hidden on the e-mail user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   In order to encode an e-mail to send to someone using PKI, you
have to have access to the person's public key. This works fine for
an internal company e-mail system _ everyone's public key could be
stored in a central place that all employees can access. But it
hasn't been very successful for e-mail outside company systems,
Arnum said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using PKI, SigabaSecure creates a new key for each
e-mail message, then enables the intended reader to get the key
from Sigaba's Web site. The software comes as a plug-in that works
with the user's regular e-mail program, such as Microsoft Outlook
or Yahoo e-mail. Once installed, SigabaSecure encrypts and decodes
e-mail at the press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a solution that is usable by the mass market, I
have a feeling that we could be talking about significant growth
for encryption,'' Arnum said.
</P>
<P>
   Sigaba, which formed in January, takes its name from the only
World War II encryption machine whose code was not broken by the
enemy. The company has $5 million in venture funding and plans to
introduce a corporate version of SigabaSecure later this year.

CLINTON TELLS DEMOCRATS THAT GORE WILL KEEP PROSPERITY ROLLING &HT;    (EDS: Updated with full speech)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton, urging America to stick with
political heir Al Gore to ``keep our prosperity going,'' boasted to
the Democratic National Convention Monday night that the
Clinton-Gore team had forged ``a better country`` since ousting
Republicans from the White House _ and warned that a GOP comeback
could trigger the economic reversals and social upheavals of the
Nixon years.
</P>
<P>
   The president bid an emotional farewell to the Democratic
faithful, offered hearty praise for his loyal vice president and
appealed to voters to choose Gore's specific policy proposals over
what the president portrayed as the vague, ill-considered schemes
of Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at this moment of unprecedented good fortune, our people
face a fundamental choice: Are we going to keep this progress and
prosperity going?`` Clinton rhetorically asked cheering party
faithful crammed into the 20,590-seat Staples Center for the
opening night of the Democratic convention. The hall rocked with a
roar of ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed it
together. And we're not going back,`` Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who introduced her husband
for his valedictory, echoed her husband's theme in remarks designed
to bolster her campaign for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a stronger, better country than we were in 1992,'' Mrs.
Clinton said. But America's progress can only continue under the
leadership of Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., the first lady insisted, adding: ``They have what it
takes. They'll do what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a hearty endorsement of his wife's candidacy for
the Senate. ``She's always been there for our family and she'll
always be there for the families of New York and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, a combative partisan who has relished the
political fray since first entering politics in Arkansas in 1974,
dismissed claims by Bush at the Republican convention on Aug. 3
that the Clinton-Gore administration had ``squandered``
opportunities presented by the nation's longest economic recovery
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear America's
success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,``
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, apparently angered by Bush's claim, struck back
by likening a Bush victory to the 1968 victory of Richard M. Nixon.
Democratic-led economic recovery and progress on civil rights gave
way to social and political tumult that deeply divided the nation,
Clinton said. ``The next election took America on a far different,
more divisive course. And within months of that election, the last
longest economic expansion in history was itself, history.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, working to bolster the White House bid of his
vice president, proudly laid claim to responsibility for the strong
economy and for generating federal budget surpluses, slashing the
national debt, restoring national confidence and transforming
education, child care, the welfare system, inner cities and the
federal tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the record,'' Clinton declared, adding in a line from
television's Los Angeles detective Joe Friday: ``Just the facts,
ma'am.``
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that, thanks to his administration, ``Americans are
better off today than we were eight years ago,'' adding: ``America
has progressed not just economically but as a community. We're not
just better off we're also a better country more decent, more
humane, more united moving forward and working together.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just economic prosperity, Clinton said. ``Jobs are up,
but so are adoptions. The debt is down, but so is teen pregnancy.
We are becoming more diverse and more united.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who seized the limelight with appearances at more than
20 events over four days in Los Angeles, was scheduled to leave Los
Angeles on Tuesday for a campaign rally in Monroe, Mich., where he
will symbolically pass the torch to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the convention that Gore had worked side-by-side in
the Oval Office ``in the most difficult days of the last years,
when we faced the toughest issues.'' Clinton added that Gore had
been ``more willing to make the tough choices'' to balance the
federal budget and ``take tough stands against those who would do
it the wrong way on the backs of the poor and working people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``understands the future and how sweeping changes can
affect Americans' daily lives,'' Clinton said, adding that a
Gore-Lieberman administration ``will keep our prosperity going.''
Clinton added: ``They believe the people you're buying your soft
drinks and popcorn from here at the Staples Center deserve the same
chance they have to send their children to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart derided Bush's
claims that Americans had suffered under the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush family may be worse off than they were eight years
ago, but I think the vast majority of Americans will argue that
their lives have become better,`` Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman linked up on the campaign trail in St. Louis
to watch the Clintons' nationally televised address.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staged a symbolic pilgrimage earlier in the day to the home
town of President Harry S. Truman, the scrappy, plain-spoken
Missouri Democrat who came from behind in 1948 to extend Democrats'
hold on the White House to 20 straight years until 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a contrast in this election and the American people
deserve to know the details of what's being proposed by the two
major parties,`` Gore told a forum in Independence, Mo. ``The
American people need to know the specifics of how the American
people would be affected if the other side won.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Stanley Greenberg, who served as the Clinton-Gore
campaign's pollster in 1992, told reporters that Gore needs to
ignite voter turnout by focusing public attention on differences
between the rivals. ``What matters for turnout is having an
election that matters,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide survey, conducted by John Zogby of Zogby
International in Utica, N.Y., and released Monday, showed Bush's
17-percentage-point edge over Gore following the GOP convention had
been cut to 3 percentage points 43 percent for Bush to 40 percent
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said in an NBC News' interview
that Clinton's successes are helping to overshadow a dark chapter
in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the escapades of President Clinton in the White
House are still in people's memories, but I think that time is
passing by,`` Carter said, adding: ``There has never been a hint of
scandal about Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who returns to the campaign trail on Friday with a
symbolic raid on Gore's native Tennessee, remained at his
1,500-acre ranch in Crawford, Texas.

 MONEYBAG: IRS WOULD REIN IN GIFT HORSE  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I know that if I give no more than $10,000 each year to my
daughter, I can avoid the gift tax. But what if I give another
$10,000 to someone else, with the understanding that they will give
the money to my daughter? Is this legal or can it be considered tax
evasion?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: I ran your question past Joe Calderaro, technical coordinator
with the Internal Revenue Service. His response: ``If those were
the facts, and the IRS knew the facts, they would say that you gave
your daughter a gift of $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   If you tried your scheme, it's unlikely that the IRS would ever
learn the facts. But it could happen if your go-between squeals on
you.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you don't
want to compound the felony by having your go-between bumped off to
preserve the omerta code of silence.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider just obeying the law, like the majority of
your fellow citizens (I hope).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Three Days to Ownership
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I purchased stock in a company on June 19. The company had
stated that there would be a dividend payable on July 10 to
stockholders of record as of June 20. But I didn't receive the
dividend. My broker explained that I was not considered a
shareholder of record until June 22, the third business day after I
placed the trade. Is this correct, or am I being cheated?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You are not being cheated. This is standard procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules imposed five years ago by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, stock trades are settled three business days
after they are placed. (Before that, it was five business days.)
Not until then are you credited with ownership on the books of the
company whose stock you purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that bookkeeping technicality, you don't have to wait
three days to sell your stock. You can place a sell order within
seconds after your buy order. (Day traders do that sort of thing
all the time.) Like the buy order, the sell order won't settle
until three business days later.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine you asking a follow-up question: ``If I am not
entitled to the dividend, shouldn't I get a discount on the price
of the stock?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes _ and in fact you did get a discount.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the stock went ex-dividend _ meaning that buyers no
longer were entitled to the next payout _ the price of the stock
was adjusted downward on the market. Prospective buyers
automatically offered less for the stock than they would have
offered if they could have received the dividend.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, that adjustment would have happened on the market
day immediately preceding the one on which you placed your order.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Shop Around for CDs
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I am a 74-year-old widow and will soon be selling my home,
giving me several hundred thousand dollars to reinvest. I intend to
live on the income (along with my Social Security and other monthly
income) for the rest of my life. I do not want to risk losing any
of it, so stocks, etc., are out. Do you have any suggestions other
than certificates of deposit? That is what I have most of my cash
in now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You may as well stick with CDs. They are federally insured,
which means they are virtually risk-free. And there don't appear to
be any risk-free investments that can top the 7 percent-plus annual
yields offered by some banks.
</P>
<P>
   CD rates can vary quite a bit from bank to bank. So don't just
walk into your neighborhood bank and accept whatever rate they
offer. Shop around _ not just in the Bay Area but in other areas
and even other states.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to get into a car or airplane to accomplish this.

 DIVIDED, WE PROSPER: GRIDLOCK CAN PAY  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is it just a coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   The great bull market of the 1990s began almost the moment the
Republicans won control of Congress in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House and
the Republicans hanging onto the leadership of the Senate and House
of Representatives, stock prices _ as measured by the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index _ have more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
   That's a phenomenal 22 percent annual growth in stock values _
more than twice the historic average.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that it is more than a coincidence. They
contend that stocks usually can be expected to do better when
Congress and the executive branch are led by different political
parties or when the leadership of Congress is divided.
</P>
<P>
   That's because little or no economically disruptive legislation
gets passed when the federal government is divided. The economy is
allowed to function on its own, and that _ say the experts _ is
good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gridlock is the best thing you can hope for from Washington,''
says David Wyss, an economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in
Massachusetts. ``If you have a Republican administration and
Congress, they will make too many tax cuts and not pay off enough
debt. If the Democrats are in charge, they will spend too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Republican George W. Bush ahead in his battle
for the presidency over Democrat Al Gore and that both the Senate
and House will could remain Republican.
</P>
<P>
   None of those results is certain, of course. The safest bet is
that the Republicans will retain control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There's more chance that the House _ where the Republicans have
a 12-seat majority _ will be captured by the Democrats. Twenty-four
GOP representatives are retiring and rookies are running in their
place. By contrast, only eight Democratic House members are
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   If the leadership of Congress is split between the parties, that
will ensure continued legislative gridlock no matter who becomes
president, predicts Greg Valliere, managing director of Charles
Schwab Corp.'s Washington Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't see either Gore or Bush getting any kind of radical
agenda through with Congress divided,'' Valliere observes. ``There
are many who point to the Bush record as governor of Texas, who say
he is a conciliator, and that he could work with a Democratic
House. But Dick Gephardt (of Missouri), who would be speaker of the
House if the Democrats take over, is not known for his
bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Valliere points out, however, that legislative gridlock doesn't
have to render a president entirely powerless.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that whoever becomes president will be able to appoint
leaders of the Federal Reserve, Federal Communications Commission,
Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory bodies that
influence the destinies of many businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the stock market has performed best with a
Democrat in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats held the presidency for 26 of the 54 years from the
end of 1945 through the end of 1999, and the average performance of
the S&AMP;P 500 during that period was a 10.9 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   During the 28 years that Republicans occupied the White House,
the S&AMP;P 500 on average gained only 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, stocks do best when the Republicans control
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress in nine
postwar years, during which the S&AMP;P 500 made a sensational average
annual gain of 18.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 39 years that the Democrats controlled both houses, the
S&AMP;P 500 averaged only a 7.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have fared very well indeed with the current lineup: a
Democratic president and Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During five years under Bill Clinton and two under Harry Truman,
the combination produced an average annual gain of 18.7 percent in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a Republican White House and a Republican
Congress actually has been slightly better for investors: an
average 19.2 percent gain. But that combination occurred in only
two post-war years, during the Eisenhower administration _ too
small a sample to be meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the overall market performs, certain companies
are likely to fare better under Bush, others under Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management in
San Francisco, notes that Gore, who has denounced rising medical
costs, might circumvent gridlock by issuing an executive order
imposing price controls on health care and drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart J. Pillette of Pillette Investment Management in San
Francisco says Bush's interest in beefing up U.S. defenses should
be good for such stocks as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed
Martin, Raytheon and Rockwell. Those stocks have perked up lately
in anticipation of a Bush victory, he notes.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it might seem that the Bush-Cheney ticket would
be practically ideal for oil and other energy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor of Texas, is friendly to the oil interests,
and his father made a fortune in oil. Dick Cheney, in accepting the
vice presidential nomination, stepped down as chief executive of
Halliburton Co., an oilfield-services company. But Marshall Acuff,
a market strategist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York, figures
that the Republican candidates will simply encourage greater oil
and gas production. Greater production would keep a lid on prices
and prevent profits from spiking.
</P>
<P>
   Valliere predicts that a Gore victory would benefit Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, the publicly held, government-affiliated companies
that provide affordable home mortgages to lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have strong support from the Congressional Black
Caucus, and Gore is more likely than Bush to protect them.
Congressional Republicans want to curtail the subsidies the
companies get from the federal government.

 MURDOCH'S NEWS CORP. TO BUY SAN FRANCISCO'S KBHK  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Feisty media mogul Rupert Murdoch added another
wrinkle to the tumultuous Bay Area media landscape Monday by
agreeing to buy KBHK (Channel 44).
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco TV station, a UPN affiliate that airs popular
shows such as ``WWF Smackdown'' and ``Moesha,'' is one of 10 that
Murdoch's News Corp. will acquire as part of a $5.35 billion deal
to buy New York's Chris-Craft Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. will boost its portfolio of TV stations to 33 and
will own two each in five cities, including megamarkets New York
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, who built News Corp. from two newspapers in Adelaide,
Australia, into a worldwide media conglomerate, beat out rival
Viacom, which had been negotiating with Chris-Craft, in the 11th
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to both shareholder and federal approval _
which could hinge on whether News Corp.'s TV stations reach more
than the maximum 35 percent of U.S. households allowed. Current
Federal Communication Commission rules would require News Corp. _
which would serve 40.5 percent of U.S. homes with the additional
stations _ to sell six of the 10 Chris-Craft stations, said Merrill
Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   However, News Corp. is fighting the 35 percent cap in court,
arguing that cable, the Internet and other advances have made the
rule archaic.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: With the recent sale of KRON and News
Corp.'s deal for KBHK, the turmoil in the Bay Area's news and
entertainment outlets is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal raises many questions about KBHK's programming,
whether News Corp. will sell the station and whether another
seismic shift in the TV media marketplace could open the door for a
San Francisco NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   If the KBHK's sale to News Corp. goes through, it could alter
the station's programming. Right now, KBHK offers a mix of
children's cartoons, African American sitcoms and professional
wrestling, following on UPN President Dean Valentine's recent boast
that the network stands for ``youth, diversity and testosterone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox could retain the UPN programming, or, in a more likely
scenario, replace it with its own or a partner's. In fact, some
media watchers believe News Corp.'s purchase of Chris-Craft is an
attempt to quash rival UPN, which last year saw a 111 percent jump
in the number of 18- to 34-year-old male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft's agreement to carry UPN programming ends in
January; and Viacom, which owns the UPN network, has said that it
might shut down UPN if the network's losses continue. UPN
contributed to a pretax loss of $60.7 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, News Corp. doesn't appear able to simply shift its Fox
programming, which includes animated comedy ``The Simpsons'' and
sitcom ``Ally McBeal,'' to KBHK.
</P>
<P>
   Those Fox programs already reside on Oakland's KTVU, a Fox
affiliate owned by Atlanta's Cox Communications. Under a deal
signed six months ago, Channel 2 will retain the Fox affiliation
for the next 10 years. According to KTVU General Manager Kevin
O'Brien, there is no ``out'' clause in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possibility'' of News Corp. stripping KTVU of its
Fox affiliation, O'Brien said. ``It's a very extensive, firm
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. spokesman Andrew Butcher said the company has not
discussed programming for KBHK or any of the other new stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those decisions haven't been made yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Fox may sell KBHK, because the
company will probably reap the most financial reward from the five
so-called ``duopolies'' in which two stations in the same market
save money by sharing some business operations.
</P>
<P>
   Having two stations each in Los Angeles and New York will give
Fox clout with advertisers and give the company the power to put on
``any syndicated show'' produced by Fox studio, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have the No. 1 market share in both markets,'' said
Mitchell Stern, head of the Fox television station group. ``No
advertiser that is doing business in those markets is going to be
able to go around us.''
</P>
<P>
   Butcher said he doesn't know which stations News Corp. may sell,
``but San Francisco is the No. 5 market and a very attractive TV
market.''
</P>
<P>
   If News Corp. were to sell KBHK, it might find a willing buyer
in NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, KRON parted ways with NBC after KRON, under
new owner Young Broadcasting, refused to pay for network programs.
KNTV (Channel 11) picked up the NBC affiliation, which begins in
2002. But some question whether the San Jose station will be
received clearly in all parts of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the complexity, according to former KRON President Amy
McCombs, is that ``if NBC were to purchase a station in the Bay
Area, it's affiliation with Granite Broadcasting (owner of KNTV) is
no longer in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC and KNTV officials did not return calls seeking comment.

CLINTON BIDS GOODBYE TO PARTY, PASSES MANTEL TO GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring that prosperity during his administration has made the
United States ``more decent, more humane, more united,'' President
Clinton bid a long goodbye to his party Monday and extended credit
for his success to his would-be successor, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the last major address of his presidency, Clinton
starred on opening night of the Democratic National Convention,
revisiting the ``bridge to the 21st Century'' theme of his 1996
campaign, and saying the nation is better off now than it was eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1992, America has grown, not just economically, but as a
community,'' Clinton said. ``We are growing more diverse and more
united. But we're not just better off, we're also a better country
_ more decent, more humane, more united. Now, that's the purpose of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to pass the mantle of party leadership to Gore,
Clinton praised the vice president's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I have worked closely together for eight years now. In
the most challenging moments, when we faced the most difficult
issues _ of war and peace, of taking on powerful special interests
_ he was always there,'' according to the text of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months left in his second and final term as
president, Clinton said, ``we built our bridge to the 21st century.
We crossed it together. And we're not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the timeline of the 2000 presidential campaign, Clinton's
speech _ his fourth before a national convention audience _ served
as a transitional moment as 4,370 delegates stand poised to
nominate Gore for the presidency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton also seized what may be his last chance
before a national audience to take credit for the nation's economic
prosperity, rebutting claims by Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Republican leadership that his policies have been meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of these eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's address capped an evening of speeches and
tributes on the theme of ``prosperity and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights included a video honoring former President
Jimmy Carter, the only other living Democratic president,
appearances by female U.S. senators, and a brief address by first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, herself a candidate for an open U.S.
Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The opening day of the convention also included the first
significant confrontation between police and a portion of the
estimated 50,000 protesters converging on the city for the four-day
event.
</P>
<P>
   Blocks from the Staples Center, hundreds of protesters clashed
with police in riot gear, resulting in 10 arrests. The
demonstrators, environmentalists objecting to Gore's ties to
Occidental Petroleum Corp., blocked a downtown intersection and
taunted police who ordered them to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, protests around the convention hall had been
raucous but largely without confrontation. For several days, the
police presence around the convention facility has been highly
visible and large in number.
</P>
<P>
   In protests of a more political nature, Republican leaders
joined together to scoff at Democratic claims of achievement on
Monday, saying Clinton and Gore are building themselves up to be
something they're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a candidate for the Democrats who can't lead, is
hesitant to take a position and America's surveys are showing
consistently they can't wait until Nov. 7 so we can have a change
in direction in this country,'' said U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this reinvention convention, Al Gore is trying to rewrite
history,'' Bonilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Back inside the Staples Center, meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, in a
tight race for the U.S. Senate, took her turn addressing the
delegates but stuck largely to the softer themes of children and
families.
</P>
<P>
   In 20-minute remarks, the first lady thanked the nation for her
time in the White House, touched on key Democratic campaign themes
and made a single reference to her own campaign against Republican
Rick Lazio back in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' Clinton said, adding, ``I will always be
profoundly grateful to all of you and to the American people for
the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the title of a book she authored on raising children,
Hillary Clinton said, ``you know, I still believe it takes a
village.'' She went on to say Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, ``have what it takes, and they'll do what it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The departing first lady, whose tenure has at times been stormy,
controversial and unpopular with the mainstream American public,
said, ``really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is:
Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the convention, both Clintons have
come under fire from within their own party for failing to stay
sufficiently out of sight during what should be Gore's moment to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   The high-wattage Clinton duo have been mingling with Hollywood
celebrities and raising millions of dollars in campaign funds since
arriving in Los Angeles over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, struggling to come out from behind Clinton's shadow
and establish himself as a viable next leader for the nation, their
activities have proven a persistent distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic advisers and leadership are hoping the Clinton factor
will diminish as the week progresses and momentum builds towards
Gore's speech accepting his party's nomination on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country wants to hear from Gore,'' said Democratic
strategist James Carville. ``Between now and November, it's Gore's
turn. But the president sometimes has a hard time keeping his
opinions to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some accounts, Clinton has been kept largely out of
the loop from the Gore campaign, and is not privy to its strategies
and machinations.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll released by Fox News/Opinion Dynamics cited 68
percent of Americans who thought Gore should ask Clinton to stay
home from campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave Los Angeles early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter, in an interview with NBC, said Gore is
coming into his own in the minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the escapades of President Clinton in the White
House are still in people's memories but I think that time is
passing by,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Missouri as the convention got under way in
California, continued to stress his key commitments to fixing
Social Security and Medicare, but avoided direct confrontation with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people on the other ticket are good men, I'll never attack
them personally,'' Gore said, referring to Bush and running mate
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Gore said, ``The American people need to know the
specifics of how the American people would be affected if the other
side won.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to arrive in Los Angeles Wednesday. On Monday,
he joined running mate Lieberman at a rally in St. Louis before
repairing to his hotel to watch the opening night of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest CBS News poll, 65 percent of Americans
plan to watch some of the Democratic National Convention on TV.

EXCERPT FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S ADDRESS IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: SUBS to update throughout) 
 (With DEM-HILLARY) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is an excerpt from remarks on Monday night by Hillary
Rodham Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am so proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment, the
most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how can we continue America's progress? By electing Al Gore
and Joe Lieberman the next president and vice president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   You know, even before he was vice president, I admired Al for
his leadership in the Senate, his understanding of the future, his
pioneering efforts to fight environmental threats that affected our
children, his work with Tipper to promote responsible parenting _
and what great parents the two of them are.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched him as Bill's trusted partner in the White House.
Together, they made the hard decisions to renew our nation's
economy and our national spirit; to advance democracy and defend
freedom around the world. And I can't wait until we watch Al Gore
take the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And standing next to him will be his wonderful wife and my dear
friend, who inspires us through her work for the homeless and her
advocacy on behalf of mental health. Tipper Gore will make a great
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   And the country has seen again Al Gore's leadership in his
choice of Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Joe 30 years ago when Bill and I were law students.
We saw then what America sees now: a person of uncommon wisdom and
integrity. I admire Joe's work to reduce the violence in our media.
And I appreciate his steadfast support for a woman's right to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   And with him is his remarkable wife, Hadassah, the immigrant
daughter of Holocaust survivors. Their story tells our children
that in America, no dream is beyond our reach.
</P>
<P>
   You know, in 1992, Bill and Al promised to put people first.
That simply meant that when people live up to their
responsibilities, we ought to live up to ours and give them the
tools and opportunities they need to build better lives. That's the
basic bargain at the heart of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   From a stronger economy to more Americans attending college to a
cleaner environment, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have put people
first. And not only that, they put children first.
</P>
<P>
   More children lifted out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   More children receiving Head Start, child care and after-school
care.
</P>
<P>
   More children than ever getting immunized against disease.
</P>
<P>
   More children whose parents can take family and medical leave to
care for them.
</P>
<P>
   And more neglected and abused foster children being adopted into
loving, permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
   Children like Dianna, who came to a White House ceremony I held
spotlighting the needs of children in foster care. Just 12 years
old, not much younger than Chelsea at the time, she spent most of
her life moving from house to house. She was so shy she could
barely look up as she spoke of her longing for a home and family of
her own.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened, I thought, ``How can we let any child grow up in
our country without a secure and loving home?''
</P>
<P>
   I worked with a bipartisan coalition to help double the number
of foster children adopted.

HISTORY ISN'T WITH ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia would have you
believe the nine-game road trip to Toronto, New York and Boston is
no more important than any other trip. But history says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five seasons, the Angels are 35-52 when visiting the
Blue Jays, Yankees and Red Sox. Those are numbers that stand out
considering the Angels were contenders in three of those seasons _
1995, '97 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have held their own in New York, going 14-14 at
Yankee Stadium since 1995. But Toronto and Boston have been
trouble. Last season, the Angels went a combined 0-12 in both
cities.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the Angels' only trips to New York and Boston this
season. They visited Toronto this season in April and lost three of
four.
</P>
<P>
   __ Return of Salmon: Right fielder Tim Salmon is expected to
return to the starting lineup tonight after watching most of
Sunday's game from the bench because of a tight groin. Salmon did
come in and deliver a pinch-single off Roger Clemens in the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, though, will be careful not to come back if he's not
ready. In 1998, a foot injury forced him into a DH role and last
season he played in only 98 games because of a sprained wrist.
</P>
<P>
   That sprained wrist, he says, forced him into bad habits that he
carried into this season. But he's been hot lately, hitting .392
since the All-Star break and establishing a career-best 17-game
hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's use your brain here a little bit,'' Salmon said.
``Everyone has had a tight hamstring or something of that nature
and tried to go hard on it. But if I had been smart the day before
that foot injury, maybe I could have avoided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is telling me to be smart about this. We've only
got six weeks left in the season. If I do anything that puts me out
for a week or two weeks, that's not good for the team.'' &QL;

CARTER BACK IN CONVENTION SPOTLIGHT; FUND-RAISER STAYS AWAY FROM
LIMELIGHT; A RIVALRY IN NEW YORK; CLINTONS AT STREISAND
FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Adds sentence in graf 2 characterizing Carter's reception at
convention; updates tenses in graf three)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB and ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four years ago, Jimmy Carter conspicuously avoided
the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His relationship
with the incumbent presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, was testy.
Put bluntly, the two former Southern governors were both
competitive and uneasy with each other. ``I've always had good
relations with Vice President Gore,'' said Carter, picking his
words carefully, as he spoke over a cellular phone Monday afternoon
from a limousine as he rode to a reception.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter is back. And the delegates _ who gave him a
prolonged standing ovation on Monday night _ clearly adored him.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the Democratic convention, Carter was
plainly delighted at the half-dozen press interviews and
spontaneous bursts of applause from delegates in the sweltering
streets of Los Angeles. Monday night, Carter was honored with a
five-minute film at the convention, before President Clinton
delivered his farewell address as chief executive to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was not planning to attend the convention in Los Angeles.
Four years ago, he had spent convention week at the Montana ranch
of Jane Fonda and Ted Turner. ``At first Al Gore invited me and I
told him I'd prefer not to come and make a big speech,'' said
Carter. ``But then the idea came for a video presentation. It's
been a very, very pleasant experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been such a pleasant experience with Clinton, who
has, nonetheless tried to make amends with Carter in the past year.
Last August Clinton flew to Atlanta to present the Medal of Freedom
to Carter, an obvious effort by the White House to smooth ties with
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The strains between Carter and Clinton were the result of the
former president's intervention in some high-profile humanitarian
and foreign issues, such as Haiti, which collided with the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strong supporters of President Clinton,'' Carter
insisted. But what about tensions with Clinton? ``We haven't had a
close relationship with him,'' said Carter. He spoke warmly about
Gore. ``Whenever there was a problem I called Al Gore,'' he said.
``I always called him. I've known him for 25 years. He's been my
key friend and trusted ally.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's enthusiasm for Carter is not altogether altruistic.
Although George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, is
favored at the moment in numerous southern states, Georgia could
prove a battleground, especially now with its new Democratic
senator, Zell Miller. And Carter could be enlisted to campaign in
the state for the Gore-Lieberman ticket. ``I'll do as requested,''
said Carter, obviously pleased at all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   FUND-RAISER STAYS AWAY FROM LIMELIGHT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one in Hollywood has ever matched Lew R. Wasserman for his
prowess raising tens of millions for the Democratic Party since the
days of John F. Kennedy. Now 87, and a bit frail, Wasserman hosted
one more fund-raiser Monday at his art-filled Beverly Hills home.
Quietly, his associates said, Wasserman is seeking to pass off some
of his political responsibilities to his grandson, Casey Wasserman.
By the time the next Democratic convention rolls around, the
younger Wasserman may have assumed some, or all, of his
grandfather's fund raising for charities and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to younger Hollywood moguls, who crave media
attention, Wasserman, the one-time chairman of MCA, Inc., does not
give interviews and said that he holds no interest in writing a
book about his years in Hollywood because he has always viewed his
roles _ as a talent agent and then executive _ as one of discretion
and privacy. He once told a visitor that his one regret was not
having accepted a top Cabinet job with President Johnson because
his wife, Edie, did not want to leave Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon's guarded event, given by the Wassermans, was
for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Wasserman and his
wife attend parties infrequently now _ although President Clinton
is known to speak frequently to him over the phone. Although
Wasserman is still actively engaged in Democratic politics,
associates acknowledged that the fund-raiser Monday _ and the
current Democratic Convention in his hometown _could mark a final
chapter for Hollywood's most powerful political fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A RIVALRY IN NEW YORK DELEGATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York delegation is hardly a vision of party unity,
displaying the not-so-simmering rivalry between two likely
gubernatorial candidates in 2002, State Comptroller Carl McCall and
Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates close to McCall _ which seems to be the majority of
them _ say that Cuomo, who is helping to run Al Gore's presidential
campaign in New York, is using the Gore-New York party apparatus to
help with his own contacts and political future.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo responded: ``How could I possibly be using the Gore
apparatus if I'm not saying anything about the gubernatorial race _
and he is?'' Cuomo was referring to McCall and his energetic,
public efforts here to line up support for his own race for
governor. McCall responded: `If somebody wants to compete with me,
I wish them luck.'' McCall added that he had very briefly said
hello to Cuomo at events here, but no more. `I don't know what kind
of a discussion we would have at this point,'' he said. `I mean,
what would we talk about?'''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTONS AT STREISAND FUND-RAISER
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton arrived early and left late (and his wife and
daughter arrived late and left early) at a Sunday brunch at Barbra
Streisand's Malibu compound that is said to have raised $10 million
for the president's library _ the most impressive haul of the
Clintons' prodigious fund raising in Los Angeles this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The brunch was off limits to the press, although a small group
of White House reporters stationed near the event tried to listen
through an immaculately trimmed hedge. A mole at the brunch
provided the following details:
</P>
<P>
   The 60 guests included such longtime Clinton fund-raisers as
Bernard Schwartz, the chairman of the Loral Space and
Communications Corp., the company whose export of satellite
technology to China attracted the scrutiny of Justice Department
investigators; Robert Johnson, the chairman of Black Entertainment
Television Holdings; Alan Patricof, the chairman of Patricof &AMP; Co.
Ventures, a venture capital firm, and Smith Bagley, the grandson of
the tobacco magnate R.J. Reynolds. Bagley's wife, Elizabeth, was
the Clinton administration's ambassador to Portugal until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Streisand and her husband, James Brolin, there were
no Hollywood celebrities in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Guests started arriving at noon for cocktails near Streisand's
garden of roses overlooking the Pacific. The president arrived
around 12:30 p.m., met privately with Streisand and Brolin, then
schmoozed with guests. The first lady and Chelsea Clinton arrived
some time later, got a lengthy tour from Streisand of her rooms
filled with quilts and American folk art, then sat down to an
outdoor buffet. Both the president and first lady made remarks.
Terry McAuliffe, the Clinton's chief fund-raiser, started off the
speeches, calling Streisand ``the greatest artist of all time.''

UDEZE MIGHT NOT REDSHIRT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Last winter, Kenechi Udeze was so distraught
over which college to attend, that his mother caught him muttering
``USC'' and ``UCLA'' in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would turn over and say USC, and then turn over and say
UCLA,'' Udeze said.
</P>
<P>
   Udeze , who is only 17, eventually chose USC, and his impact
with the Trojans has come much quicker than expected. He made a
splash during the first scrimmage when he swatted down a Carson
Palmer pass, then swung his arms in the air as if he was hitting a
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either that or start break dancing,'' Udeze said. ``At
halftime, coach (Ed) Orgeron said we had to get pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's coaches are the ones pumped up today. Udeze, a redshirt
candidate coming out of Verbum Dei High, is not expected to sit out
this season and could see action in the season opener against Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been something about this guy that's been
exciting,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``This is faster than what
I anticipated. The feeling all along is that he has a great future.
The concern is he's a year younger for his class and would need to
redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's come in here and he's just going. With our situation,
it's really been exciting. He gets chances and keeps working.''

<P>
   Udeze, who is 6-foot-4, 305-pounds, has lost nearly 50 pounds
since the beginning of his senior year at Verbum Dei. He would like
to lose a little more weight to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   His size has already prompted Orgeron to nickname him BKU for
Big Kenechi Udeze.
</P>
<P>
   But before his college career begins in earnest, Udeze will no
doubt cause a minor stir with his comments on the recruiting
process, specifically his home visit with UCLA coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really confused about where to go, and he came into my
house and lied and said USC got another commitment from a defensive
tackle, and I was no longer their No. 1 prospect,'' Udeze said.
``He said they got some JC guy. I knew it wasn't true. So I knew I
couldn't go there after he said that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hale departs: Walk-on wide receiver Donald Hale, whom Hackett
felt was a strong candidate for a scholarship, has left camp and
decided to concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   __ Abdul-Shaheed debuts: Defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed
participated in his first practice after being out the past week
with a sore shoulder. His return means the Trojans have nearly
every player practicing at least once a day except offensive guard
Trevor Roberts (sprained foot), who is supposed to be out for the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Troy Polamalu, who has what might be a minor
concussion, is expected back Wednesday. Linebacker Markus Steele
has seen limited practice time with a left-hamstring injury but
said he should be fine by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Kori Dickerson did not practice Monday afternoon
after being nicked in the shin but is expected to return today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guenther to play: After a nice scrimmage, tight end Gregg
Guenther of Taft High probably will not redshirt, Hackett said,
meaning the Trojans will play two true freshman (Guenther, Alex
Holmes of Harvard-Westlake) at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty impressive with the skills he has right now,''
Hackett said of Guenther.
</P>
<P>
   __ Closed scrimmage: The Trojans will scrimmage Wednesday, but
it is not open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   __ Boskovich makes move: Freshman Joe Boskovich of Westlake High
has taken the lead to be the snapper on field goals and extra
points.``It looks like he's about to win the job,'' Hackett said.
``We'll know Wednesday.''

COSTCO HOLDUP VICTIM REMEMBERED BY FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As detectives searched Monday for two men wanted
in a botched holdup at the Costco store in Van Nuys, Calif.,
friends mourned the death of a 29-year-old shopper caught in the
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Alexander Wolf of Studio City, a production assistant and
aspiring sitcom writer, was near the store entrance when an armed
courier returned to his truck with a money pickup, about 2:30
Sunday afternoon. That's when a gunman yelled out, ``This is a
robbery,'' and began shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was hit in the head by one of about 30 bullets, said Lt.
Jim Grayson of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division. He died at
Valley Presbyterian Hospital a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Two other shoppers were shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was a production assistant for the CBS drama ``C.S.I.''
(Crime Scene Investigators) scheduled to premiere this fall. He
spent last season as a production assistant on the WB series
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a sweet guy. He was really nice, unassuming and always
working. It's just a shock,'' said one of Wolf's neighbors, Hope
Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   A 57-year-old man and his 51-year-old wife shopping at the store
in the 6100 block of Sepulveda Boulevard remained hospitalized with
life-threatening gunshot wounds Monday, Grayson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were taken to hospitals -- a 20-year-old woman
who had minor scrapes and a 37-year-old woman who fainted, police
said. Both were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three robbery suspects, Ramon Gutierrez, 38, of
Tijuana, was wounded in his left leg and arrested after driving
away in a white van. His injuries were not life-threatening, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining suspects were still at large Monday, police
said. Both are described as Latinos between 25 to 35 years old. One
is about 5 feet 11 inches, 200 to 235 pounds. The other is about 5
feet 9 inches and 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   A Pico Rivera-based Sectran Security Inc. courier was doing a
routine pickup at Costco when two men with automatic rifles
approached, said LAPD Officer Don Cox.
</P>
<P>
   The men began exchanging gunfire with the courier as about 75
customers scurried for cover and parents grabbed their children.
</P>
<P>
   The guard scrambled back to his truck and was not hit by the
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the luckiest person alive. I don't see how he wasn't hit
with so many bullets being fired,'' Grayson said.
</P>
<P>
   A third person driving the van picked up the two suspects and
drove off. The wounded man was arrested after being spotted by an
off-duty LAPD officer, but the other two suspects were not found.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf had moved to Southern California from his hometown in
Philadelphia to get into the film industry, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was into writing. He wanted to develop a sitcom,'' said one
co-worker, Sharon Eldridge.
</P>
<P>
   His duties as a production assistant entailed driving to film
sets to distribute scripts and running errands, co-workers and
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't necessarily thrilled with his position, but he knew
it was a stepping stone, and he did his work more often with a
smile on his face,'' said another co-worker and friend, Gregg
Pallini. ``I'm just having a hard time even being able to grasp how
something like this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Mendelsohn and Jim Hart, executive producers of
``C.S.I.,'' released a statement after learning of Wolf's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Owen for too short a time. We are deeply saddened,''
they said. ``He was an amazing young man with a vibrant personality
who showed great promise for the future. It is everyone's loss, and
we particularly send our heartfelt sympathy to his family and
friends.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, IN CONVENTION FAREWELL, CALLS GORE HIS HEIR
 &HT;    Eds: Make slight changes throughout.
 &HT;    750&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton, occupying political center
stage for perhaps the last time, Monday night declared Al Gore the
rightful heir to a ``more confident, hopeful and just'' America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the only Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to serve two
terms as president, basked in a curtain call unseen at a Democratic
National Convention in more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the personal shortcomings that tainted his presidency,
Clinton electrified the nearly 5,000 delegates who jammed the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 45-minute televised speech _ delivered mostly after
prime time in the East _ sought to rebut Republican claims that his
administration deserved little credit for the unprecedented
economic prosperity of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the GOP promise of ``prosperity with a purpose,''
Clinton added, ``We're not just better off. We're also a better
country _ more decent, more humane, more united. Now, that's the
purpose of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America is more confident, hopeful and just, more secure and
free, because we offered a vision and worked together to achieve
it,'' he said. ``My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with
confidence: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed it
together. And we're not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the U.S. Senate in
New York, introduced her husband and, like him, promoted Gore and
his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   She did not mention Clinton's impeachment following his
extramarital affair with a former White House intern, but did thank
the delegates for their support ``in good times and in bad'' during
her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced to the strains of ``New York, New York,'' she
reminded the delegates of her Senate race as she vowed to continue
the work she began years ago with the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe it takes a village,'' she said, referring to
her book that was ridiculed at the 1992 GOP convention for its
promotion of children's rights. ``And it certainly takes Al Gore
and Joseph Lieberman. They have what it takes. And they'll do what
it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending his own political legacy, Clinton also promoted his
vice president's candidacy. He called Gore ``a profoundly good
man'' and ``one strong leader,'' and said he was ``always there''
as he faced issues of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else I've ever known in public life, Al Gore
understands the future and how sweeping changes can affect
Americans' daily lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore and Lieberman will ``keep our prosperity
going,'' in contrast to a Republican administration that would
``spend every dime of our projected surplus'' on tax cuts rather
than on education, Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has consistently trailed the GOP nominee, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, in public opinion polls, the Democratic
convention opened with unusually high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's evening session began with a brief video clip of
President John F. Kennedy, nominated here in 1960. As his
distinctive voice echoed eerily through the Staples Center, a
sustained cheer erupted from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gov. Gray Davis of California recalled how the
Democrats had ``passed the torch'' to a new generation in 1960 and
that it was now time to ``pass that flame'' to Gore, the party's
first presidential nominee of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's program was largely designed as a passing of the torch
from Clinton to Gore, who _ not by accident _ was campaigning in
Independence, Mo., the home of Harry Truman, who also had to labor
to escape the shadow of a larger-than-life president, Franklin
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``one of the best decisions of my life'' was
``asking Al Gore to be my partner'' in 1992. He reminded the
delegates that his administration's economic program passed
Congress with Gore's tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grew nostalgic toward the end of his address, noting how
America had given him a chance ``to live my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to give you a better chance to live yours,'' he
added. ``Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the
same optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years
ago, my heart is filled with gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, the future of our country is in your
hands. You must think hard, feel deeply, and choose wisely.
Remember, keep putting people first. Keep building those bridges.
And don't stop thinking about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Thousands of protesters skirmished with police as Clinton was
speaking, and officers used tear gas to disperse protesters who
threw rocks and bottles at them and set small fires.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia
was noted for its political harmony, the Democratic convention
began with some jarring notes in the ``Prosperity and Progress''
theme:
</P>
<P>
   _ Monday night's finale following Clinton's speech featured the
Broadway cast of ``The Music Man'' performing ``76 Trombones.'' The
play is about a slick traveling salesman who pretends to be a band
leader in order to con working families to buy musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the party luminaries, Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California, declined an opportunity to address the convention on
opening night after bowing to pressure and moving a fund-raiser
from the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Catholic Cardinal Roger Mahoney, in his invocation, took issue
with the Democratic Party's platform support for abortion rights.
``In you, oh God, we trust ... that you will keep us ever committed
to protect the life and well-being of all people, but especially
unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The evening ``talk show'' format featuring average Americans
who had benefited from the economic prosperity of the last eight
years developed some technical difficulties, and the attention of
many delegates in the convention hall drifted away. Most of the
television networks skipped it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But the enthusiasm in the convention hall returned when former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were introduced
before the airing a video tribute to the only living Democratic
ex-president, and one who is widely admired for his personal
character.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute to Carter was Gore's idea after viewing tributes to
former GOP presidents at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   And a series of women speakers sent scores of demonstrators to
the floor, waving placards that read: ``When Women Vote, Women
Win.'' The speakers included six women from the U.S. Senate: Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California, Barbara Mikulski of
Maryland, Patty Murray of Washington, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana
and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The prominent role of women Monday night underscored the
importance of women voters in this election. Gore and Bush
strategists view them as crucial and thus far, Bush is running
close to Gore among women, wiping out the gender gap that helped
elect Clinton in 1992 and 1996.

NOT FAR FROM HOME, PETTITTE SHUTS DOWN RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Andy Pettitte ambled into the clubhouse
Monday afternoon and saw about a dozen of his teammates watching
the movie ``American Pie.'' He glanced at the screen once and then
retreated to his locker.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte did not have the interest or the time to watch the
movie because he was engrossed with his own preparation. He had to
remind himself that he could win at the Ballpark in Arlington.
Forget about being so close to home and about being in a place that
has been tougher for him than any other in the American League.
Just focus. Just pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Pettitte did. Pettitte pitched precisely while
Jorge Posada and Derek Jeter stroked two-run homers as the Yankees
cruised to a 7-3 victory over the Texas Rangers. Pettitte did not
allow a run until the eighth inning, and the Yankees stifled the
listless Rangers for the ninth straight time, including the 1999
Division Series. What else is new? The Yankees have now won 34 of
the last 45 regular and post-season games against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Pettitte started with an 0-3 record and a 16.05 earned run
average in his first three starts here, he has won two straight
starts in the last 51 weeks and chopped his ERA to 9.33. Some of
Pettitte's family members from Deer Park, Tex., which is about
three hours away, did not attend one of his starts a few years ago
because they were worried about jinxing him.
</P>
<P>
   But that should not be a concern anymore. Not after Pettitte won
his fifth straight start in dominating fashion to boost his record
to 14-6. With 48 games left, Pettitte should make about nine more
starts, so he has a chance to win 20 games for the second time in
his career. Monday night, Pettitte, who permitted three earned runs
in seven plus innings, was happy to simply win another game at the
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 93-degree heat, Pettitte worked quicker than normal.
He did not stray too far from the pitcher's rubber and raced
through the first on two groundouts and a strikeout. Gabe Kapler
lined a one-out single to center in the second to extend his
hitting streak to 27 games, the longest in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Ricky Ledee, the former Yankee, faced Pettitte.
Manager Johnny Oates had originally said that he might not play
Ledee against the left-handed Pettitte, but, if the Rangers want to
know what kind of hitter Ledee can be, it makes sense to play him
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee had only 40 at-bats against left-handers this year and he
had never had a regular season at-bat against Pettitte. But Ledee
showed more flashes of his potential when he crushed one of
Pettitte's pitches to right-center field. Bernie Williams sprinted
toward his left, his arms pumping and his eyes locked in on the
ball. Williams dived and caught the ball about waist high and slid
along the grass, winding up a few inches from the warning track. He
looked up and exhaled after saving Pettitte from allowing a certain
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had other chances against Pettitte. Pettitte walked
one in the third, but stranded him. Left fielder David Justice
dropped an easy fly ball in the fourth when he closed his glove too
soon, but Pettitte quickly got Rafael Palmeiro to bounce into a
double play. Kapler followed with a single, but was picked off.
Luis Alicea reached base on Luis Sojo's error in the sixth, but
Pettitte retired three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It was a refreshing evening for Pettitte, who has had too many
forgettable nights here. Pettitte lost, 15-2, here on July 30, 1996
when he was torched for a career-worst 10 earned runs, and he was
battered, 10-0, on July 7, 1995, before 200 friends and relatives.
But Pettitte was superb Monday night and provided enough excellent
footage to make his own home movie.  &QL;

GORE VISITS HOME OF TRUMAN TO DISCUSS MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ Al Gore came to Harry Truman's hometown on
Monday to claim the mantle as defender of senior citizens and
Medicare, the old-age health care program that Truman championed
half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told a crowd of several hundred _ mostly senior citizens _
that if elected president, he would use the nation's projected
budget surpluses to expand the Medicare program to cover
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to strengthen Social Security, improve benefits for
long-term care for seniors and establish full health insurance for
all children within the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need step by step to get to Truman's goal of universal
health care coverage,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance in Independence was part of a weeklong
campaign swing leading up to his nomination Wednesday at the
Democratic National Convention. He talked about children's health
care in Cleveland and tax cuts to spur economic development in a
Philadelphia suburb.
</P>
<P>
   He led a forum on cleaning up the environment in Springdale,
Pa., at the former home of author Rachel Carson, whose 1962 book
Silent Spring sparked the modern environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose Independence as the scene for Monday's forum on
senior issues to evoke Truman's legacy of supporting health
protections for the elderly. President Johnson came to Independence
to sign the legislation that created the Medicare program 35 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at the Sermon Community Center, said that before
the law about half of the nation's elderly had health insurance.
After the law 95 percent were covered. Today senior citizens'
dependence on prescription drugs makes Medicare drug coverage
essential, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would cover half the cost of prescriptions up to
$5,000 a year. Additional coverage would kick in once a patient
paid more than $4,000 out of pocket. For elderly people with
incomes less than $11,000 a year, the plan would cover all premiums
and copayments.
</P>
<P>
   In the 72-minute forum, Gore criticized big drug companies and
HMOs, answered questions from the audience and listened to accounts
of people struggling to pay for drugs or qualify for government
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore never mentioned Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush by name, but he warned his audience that his opponent's plans
for Medicare and Social Security would jeopardize benefits from
both programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't squander the surplus on a big tax cut for the wealthy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Bush spokesman Bob Hopkins scoffed at Gore's
criticism. He said the Clinton-Gore administration rejected
bipartisan ideas promoted by the Social Security reform commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is having a convention conversion,'' Hopkins said.
``He is reinventing himself as someone who is actually concerned
with reforming Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was especially critical of Bush's plan to let workers place
part of their Social Security taxes into stock and bond
investments. Because taxes on workers pay for retirees' benefits,
the diverted money would have to be made up from general government
revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Popular government programs would have to be cut and little
money would be left over to pay for Medicare benefits, which are
expected to swell as the baby-boom generation retires, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the proposal, he said, is that even a
booming stock market has winners and losers. Programs that have
losers often ask for a government bailout. He compared the
situation with the Freedom to Farm program, which worked well when
farm commodity prices were high but required government subsidies
when prices plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it cost that much to bail out the Freedom to Farm Bill, how
much will it cost to bail out the Social Security Freedom to Fail
bill?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the question-and-answer session, several persons expressed
fear about switching to a system in which part of their Social
Security benefits were invested in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a misunderstanding of the Bush proposal, which calls for
letting workers have the choice of investing part of their tax
payments. Bush's plan would make no changes in retirees' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said nothing to correct their misconception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't you get on the Internet and find some good
investments?'' Gore asked as the crowd broke into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather keep my Social Security,'' the woman replied as the
crowd cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, of the Bush campaign, said the Republican plan would
have no effect on current retirees or those approaching retirement.
It would allow younger workers to invest part of their taxes so
they could pay for part of their own retirement, instead of relying
on the taxes of future workers.
</P>
<P>
   Current Social Security taxes pay for retirees' benefits and
fund a surplus that is invested in government bonds. Part of that
surplus could be diverted to private investment accounts without
endangering current benefits, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush expected that at retirement, most workers would use
their investments to buy annuities, which would provide guaranteed
annual incomes for the rest of their lives. Bush has never
suggested that retirees would have to put part of their benefits in
the stock market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the typical demagoguery that we have seen over the
last 7 1/2 years from Al Gore,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare drug benefits, Gore said his plan was in the best
interest of the public. The Bush plan, he said, is designed to
protect the financial interests of major pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers say they need big profits to fund the research that
discovers new drug therapies. Gore said it had the ring of truth.
But companies sometimes spend more advertising their drugs than
finding new ones.
</P>
<P>
   And when patents are about to expire to let generic drugmakers
into the market and lower the price, he said, companies hire
lobbyists to get special laws passed to thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our plan leads to lower prices, well, that's good,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilson, 78, of Independence, said he found Gore's speech
enlightening.

   ``If he can propose anything to reduce medical expenses, that
would be a real benefit to senior citizens,'' he said. ``Everyone's
getting gassed by it.''

   Former Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said he thought Gore
connected with the crowd, particularly while discussing his plan to
protect Social Security benefits. He said critics who described
Gore as wooden were unfairly comparing Gore with President Clinton,
who has an amazing ability to make people feel as if he were
talking directly to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good example of how (Gore) really does relate to
people,'' Cleaver said. ``I've seen him do it with small groups
before. ... He may not have the charisma (of Clinton), but Bush
certainly doesn't have it either.''

ASHCROFT'S ABSENCE AT CONVENTION WAS INTENTIONAL, CARNAHAN CLAIMS

   LOS ANGELES _ Republican John Ashcroft did not speak to the
Republican National Convention, because George W. Bush wanted to
distance himself from conservative members of Congress, Democrat
Mel Carnahan charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ashcroft, whom Carnahan is challenging for a
second term in the U.S. Senate from Missouri this November, shot
back that Ashcroft, in fact, was invited to speak to the GOP
convention earlier this month but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft thought it was more important to listen to
Missouri's working families,'' Ashcroft spokesman David James said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan did not buy that explanation. Two days before his own
convention speech, now tentatively set for Wednesday afternoon, the
two-term governor said the decision to keep Ashcroft off the stage
in Philadelphia was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very conscious decision on the part of the handlers
and managers of the Republican convention to not show the far-right
wing of their party,'' Carnahan said. ``And it was part of the
effort to really masquerade or cover up what the Republican
Congress is really about.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Ashcroft, who also served two terms as Missouri's
governor, was not the only conservative who was kept from the
public. Others included Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, House
Majority Leader Dick Armey and Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's speech Wednesday will not be on prime-time TV, so the
governor said he had no idea how valuable the speech would be for
his campaign. But he said he was pleased to be invited.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan also addressed the convention four years ago. This time
he expects to review some of the accomplishments of his years in
office and some of the issues he would focus on as senator.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, Ashcroft's campaign noted Monday that Carnahan
accepted a $2,000 donation in June from Christie Hefner, head of
Playboy Enterprises. James said Carnahan should return the money
and ``distance himself from the low morals of the pornography
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have canceled a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan aide Tony Wyche said the campaign would not return the
money. He pointed to what he called a questionable donation
Ashcroft had received from a New Jersey drug manufacturer shortly
after Ashcroft passed a bill helpful to the company.
