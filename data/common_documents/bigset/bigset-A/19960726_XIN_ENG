PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tutsi-led Burundian army
announced today a military take-over and named a former military
president, Pierre Buyoya, to replace the ousted Hutu president,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The toppled president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, was still
inside the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's foreign minister and its parliament speaker were
among several refugees at the German ambassador's home, said
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who is visiting South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic fighting between the majority Hutus and the minority
Tutsis broke out in 1993 after the country's first democratically
elected Hutu president was murdered. More than 100,000 people are
estimated to have died in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Draft Treaty on Nuclear Tests Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- France supports the draft nuclear
test ban treaty proposed on June 28, French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said today.
</P>
<P>
Though it has some defects, France will support the draft "as
it stands," he said.
</P>
<P>
A negotiating committee of the Conference on Disarmament tabled
a compromise agreement on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on
nuclear weapons after the last round of negotiations missed an
official deadline of June 28 when the 61 participating nations
failed to agree on various aspects of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The third and final round of talks start next week and are due
to end on September 13, ready for the treaty to be opened for
signature at the U.N. General Assembly later the same month.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said the draft treaty, which is the result of
"reasonable compromise," calls for a complex mechanism to enforce
the treaty over several years and leaves the door open for some
countries to sign up at a later date.
</P>
<P>
France is "ready to support the rapid transmission of this
text... to the U.N. General Assembly with a signing in New York in
autumn 1996 expected," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
"Since June 27, our representative at the Conference on
Disarmament has declared that France would be ready to accept the
project as it is, despite the imperfections that it includes in
our point of view but which is inherent in a compromise," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to rules on on-site inspection and on how the
treaty should come into force.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis on Rise In Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis cases in Kenya
increased to 4,000 in 1995 from only 400 in 1985, Kenyan Minister
for Health Joshua Angatia said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Mbagathi District Hospital where he opened a
new tuberculosis clinic, Joshua Angatia attributed the rise in TB
cases to the HIV epidemic which continues to threaten the
population in the country.
</P>
<P>
Around one million Kenyans are reportedly carrying HIV virus
which causes the killer disease of AIDS, and many TB Cases are
reportedly HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that with the advent of HIV and the
increase of TB cases in the country, there is need to expand
the hospital to cope with the high number of patients and
help decongest Kenyantta National Hospital in Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> France Lives Another Day of Agony Facing History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- France today lived another day of
agony facing its history when nearly one thousand people joined a
funeral here for one of the most notorious Nazi collaborators of
the country, Paul Touvier.
</P>
<P>
The funeral for the former chief of the Lyon Militia was held
this morning in the Church of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Joining the funeral were members of the reactionary Association
Petain-Verdun, Prince Sixte of the Bourbon Family, Deputy Mayor of
Montfermeil, and a delegate of the Delegate-Minister of City and
Integration, alongside nearly one thousand people consisting
mostly of the aged and the young with short-cut hair.
</P>
<P>
Touvier, dubbed "French Barbie"in reference to the Gestapo
chief of Lyon during the occupation, died on July 17 at the age of
81 in the Frenes prison hospital after two years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to
life imprisonment on April 20, 1994 by the Assize Court of
Yvelines for assassinating seven Jews in 1944.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in May 1989 in Nice after 45 years of hiding
and was the only Frenchman convicted of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Seven Jews taken hostage by the fascist Francs-gardes'
execution squad were shot dead against a wall of the
Rillieux-la-Pape Cemetery in Rhone on June 29, 1944, at the order
of Touvier.
</P>
<P>
At today's funeral, however, some people looked at him as a
hero who saved the lives of 93 Jews during a crackdown by the
police of the Vichy puppet regime after the death of a secretary
of state of the regime on June 29, 1944.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to fall into the hands of justice of God than
into the justice of man," said Abbot Philippe Laguerie who
presided over a lingering mass for the former collaborator.
</P>
<P>
The priest said that Touvier had a "delicate, sensible and
subtle soul" who will "appear before a divine tribunal where there
is neither media, nor coups of the media, nor...."
</P>
<P>
Touvier himself did not spare any efforts to portray himself as
a patriot who tried to save France "at a time of its agony".
</P>
<P>
In a testament entitled "The Lights of My Life" made public by
his wife Monique and his two sons Chantal and Pierre in 1989,
Touvier said, "I have never killed, nor given order to kill. I
have never tortured, nor given order to torture or assisted in
torturing. I have never done anything except to save human lives."
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the Justice Minister of the Gaullist
government Edmond Michelet in 1960, Touvier justified his
collaborations with Nazis by accusing "the socialist and
freemasonist government" of the Third Republic of doing nothing in
front of mounting threats from the Germans.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the funeral, some journalists were attacked by
some funeral attenders without serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
Touvier was buried in the Fresnes Cemetery.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Homes Sales Down in June as Mortgage Rates Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in U.S.
fell by 2.3 percent in June mainly because the mortgage rates
reached the highest average in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Realtors in U.S. said today that
sales of previously owned single-family homes totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 4.18 million, down from a record 4.28
million in May, which was revised up from an initial estimate of
4.26 million.
</P>
<P>
In the first five month of this year, sales of existing homes
in the country rose in every month except plunging 3.9 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing home totaled 3.80 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the sales in June posted the only gain in South
with an increase of 0.6 percent. Sales were unchanged in the
Northeast and they fell 8.9 percent in the Midwest as well as 1.1
percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
The Decline of sales resulted from a rising mortgage rates. The
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgages averaged 8.32 percent in June, up from 8.07 in May and
the same as April 1995. The average had fallen to 7.03 percent
last January, more than two percentage points lower than the same
month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the U.S. housing market said the increase in spring
home buying season was dominated by consumers jumping to purchase
before rates rose further and the market is cooling down now.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Summit to Discuss Liberian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Some heads of state of the Economic
Community of West African States Committee of Nine will converge
on Friday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, to deliberate on the
lingering Liberian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The summit, though regarded by some people as a mere talk
shop, will also discuss the financial crisis of the regional
body, economic crisis of member states and territorial conflicts,
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The committee of nine, whose foreign ministers have been in
Abuja since Monday, includes Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that many of the leaders would not attend in
person and will most likely be represented by the foreign
ministers at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, who is also the ECOWAS
president, is believed to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Liberia will be represented by several members of warring
factions including Charles Taylor, one of the most controversial
warlords in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that two weeks before the summit, Taylor was in
Abuja with a number of aides including Information Minister
Victoria Raffel, a strong member of Taylor's National Patriotic
Front of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen peace conferences have been held and peace
accords signed. But the warlords have not shown sufficient good
faith and commitment to see peace return to the war-ravaged
country.

<HEADLINE> Orders for Durable Goods in U.S. Decline in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods slipped 0.8 percent in June, the fourth decline in
the past six months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders totaled a seasonally adjusted
169.1 billion dollars in June, down from the record 170.4 billion
in May. The 4.2 percent increase in May had been the steepest
since last August.
</P>
<P>
Durable goods are those expected to last more than three years
and orders for durable goods are considered a key gauge of the
manufacturing sector in U.S.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, orders for durable goods
in the U.S. were just 5.4 percent above those of the same period
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the U.S. Commerce Department said transportation
orders fell 1.3 percent in June, due to a drop in both aircraft
and automobile demand. Orders for industrial machinery and
equipment fell 1.1 percent following May's 1.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment posted a
1.6 percent advance, the only increase in the major categories.
</P>
<P>
Defense orders shot up 31.6 percent after a 5.8 percent gain a
month earlier. Excluding defense, orders fell by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.7 percent, the ninth
increase in the last 10 months. A growing backlog suggests
businesses may require additional production facilities and
manpower to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, were off 1 percent,
the first decline since March. Shipments had risen 1.7 percent in
May and 2.6 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
But many U.S. economic analysts said the decline of orders for
durable goods was temporary because manufacturing is staging a
comeback after recent sluggishness.

<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tutsi-dominated Burundi army
today staged a putsch ousting President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
and replacing him with former president Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
News reports from Bujumbura said that the Burundi Radio
broadcast a communique by the Defense Ministry declaring a
stoppage of all political activities, the closing of air and land
frontiers, a ban of all demonstrations and strikes, and a curfew
from 19:00 to 05:30 across the country.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse reported from Bujumbura that tension is
"brutally high" there and the city is now "criss-crossed" by
the army.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Buyoya, who will make a speech to the
nation later today, will be the provisional president for an
unfixed period of time.
</P>
<P>
President Ntibantunganya is now hiding in the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that the putsch could plunge the
central African state into a bloodbath of war between the majority
Hutus and minority Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Expansion Do Not Pose Threat to Russia, Lebed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the powerful Russian
Security Council, Alexander Lebed, said that NATO's eastward
expansion does not pose a threat to his country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Financial Times, which was published
here today, Lebed said that he had no objections to the NATO
enlargement to include East European countries.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is not planning to fight anyone. Truly this is so. And
so this mighty NATO fist is being developed to do battle with the
air," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was personally calm about the enlargement of
the U.S.-led Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Lebed chief of the
Russian Security Council on June 18 after Lebed securing a third
place in the first round of the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's remarks differ greatly from the official line on the
issue, that is, Russia is strongly opposed to the enlargement as
it will pose a threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers will meet in December this year to
decide if Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will become
members of the military alliance.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Finance Minister on 1996/97 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa today pledged the government's commitment to
reducing the high budget deficit and promote a real economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1996/97 budget to parliament, Murerwa admitted
the government has failed to adhere to targets agreed with donors
to reduce the budget deficit from 10 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) to five percent by the end of the first phase of
the economic reform program in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget deficit has soared to more than 10 percent
of GDP due to the excessive government expenditure, which has
resulted in heavy borrowing by the state from the domestic money
market.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the performance of the agro-based economy, Murerwa
said GDP growth during 1995 fell by two percent compared with
five percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The decline in economic performance during 1995 was mainly
attributed to the lingering effects of the 1994/95 drought, which
was as severe as the 1991/92 drought, which saw real growth
falling by over seven percent.
</P>
<P>
He said agricultural production, which fell by 10 percent in
1994, declined further by 19 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, the economy is expected to grow by seven percent,
benefiting from the 49 percent increase in agricultural
production as a result of the above average 1995/96 rain season.
</P>
<P>
The minister said manufacturing, which contributes 25 percent
to GDP, will grow by 3.2 percent after declining by over eight
percent last year, while mining is projected to register an
improvement of 13 percent, and the financial services and
insurance sectors by four percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which once peaked to 50 percent in August 1992, is
expected to end the year pegged at 17 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Exports will this year grow by 9.5 percent and imports by 7.5
percent, reflecting a current account deficit of 4.5 percent of
GDP compared with 5.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the balance-of-payments position is in 1996 expected
to decline from a surplus of 1.59 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (159
million US Dollars) to a deficit of 350 million Zimbabwe Dollars
(35 million US Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government to Press Ahead With Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today
said it will press ahead with tough economic reforms and solve a
serious unemployment crisis which it admitted threatens social
and political stability.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1996/97 budget speech to parliament, Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa said the government is already preparing
to launch the second phase of the reforms, and consolidate on
success achieved during the first five year of the program, which
ended last year.
</P>
<P>
He said growth will support employment creation by the private
sector, the lynch-pin of Zimbabwe's economic success.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth during the first phase of the reforms was
disappointing, averaging one percent against a target of five
percent, while population growth soared by 3.1 percent, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The major setback, he said, is the failure by the government
to reduce the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic
product, despite pledges to donors to cut it from 10 percent to
five percent of GDP by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, huge parastatal losses and the resultant
subsidies have forced the government to increase borrowing on the
domestic market, further fueling inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
As the government prepares to launch the second phase of the
reforms, he said, it will redouble efforts to curb spending, and
this will call for further stringent measures to ensure
ministries spend within their means.

BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth rate
this year could be the lowest in 10 years, according to the

The central bank's forecast for this year's economic growth

<P>
The current account deficit for this year will be 7.8 percent
of gross domestic product, instead of 6.6 percent.

<P>
The new inflation target will be 5.5 percent, higher than the
earlier projection of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The adjustments have been made because the country is facing
slow growth in many fields resulting from various factors.
</P>
<P>
Exports during the first half of this year grew only 8.3
percent, as against a projected 18 percent growth over last year.
Export growth target has also been lowered to 14 percent for the

ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Hungary's
Krisztina Egerszegi, who grabbed three golds at the Barcelona
Olympic Games, displayed her advantage in the 200m backstroke
heats.
</P>
<P>
The third-time Olympian, who only managed a bronze in the 400m
IM on Saturday, finished 2:09.18 to top the qualifiers' list, 2.45
seconds ahead of second-placed Whitney Hedgepeth of the United
States who won a silver medal in the 100m back final on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anke Scholz of Germany came in third at 2:12.73.
</P>
<P>
World second-ranked Miki Nakao of Japan also qualified after
finishing fouth in the heats.
</P>
<P>
Another big shot Alexander Popov of Russia also proved that he
was the No.1 for the men's 50m sprint.
</P>
<P>
The Russia clocked 22.22 to finish atop, but 0.41 seconds
slower than Tom Jager's world mark set in March, 1990 in
Nashville, United States.
</P>
<P>
Gary Hall Jr. was again edged to the second place with a margin
of 0.14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
China's Jiang Chengji, who came in third, made ripples in the
pool again as he scored his third Asian record-beating time at the
current Games.
</P>
<P>
He shattered the men's 100m butterfly Asian mark twice on
Wednesday and broke the 50m free Asian best with 22.55 this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Jani Sievinen is on his way to the first medal for his country.
</P>
<P>
The Finn, world record holder in the men's 200m IM, booked the
first place in his speciality, though his time of 2:01.05 was
almost three seconds slower than the world record.
</P>
<P>
Tom Dolan, top-ranked in the event and the serious threat to
Sievinen, finished with a bitter sixth place with 2:01.99.

<HEADLINE> Public Servants Strike In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian commonwealth public
servants in all states except Victoria today held a 24-hour strike
in protest against proposed cuts in jobs and funding in the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
Wendy Caird, national secretary of the Community and Public
Sector Union (CPSU), said many government offices were closed or
operating on skeleton staff.
</P>
<P>
"We have had reports from all states that our members have
overwhelmingly supported the strike," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPSU estimated about 55,000 federal public servants took
part in the strike. "This shows the strength of the anger amongst
public sector workers about the government's attacks on jobs and
services, and this is a clear warning that the government can
expect further disruption if they proceed with more cuts in the
August budget," Caird said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the job losses had now reached 15,400,
contradicting government assurances before the federal election in
March that the total number of jobs to be cut from the public
sector would be 2,500 over three years.
</P>
<P>
But the government alleged that today's strike failed. The
Industrial Relations Minister Petter Reith said "this is a paltry
performance, the CPSU did not have the support of the workers and
today's response is a lesson to unions that they are out of touch
with the workforce."
</P>
<P>
In the capital, the National Gallery of Australia was closed,
but the National Library and old Parliament House were open. In
Sydney, it was reported a cargo was being loaded on planes at the
airport without customs checks.

<HEADLINE> Bacterial Strain Going on in Japan Occurs in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Outbreaks of food poisoning
caused by a fierce strain of E. coli bacteria like the one now
going on in Japan also have occurred in the United States, New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bacterium is a familiar, and usually harmless, inhabitant
of the human and animal gut. It was first identified as a problem
in 1982 and was recognized as hazard by doctors only after four
people died and 700 became ill in 1993 in the northwestern United
States. The outbreak was caused by undercooked hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, doctors have found that the bacteria strain, known
as O157:7, has borrowed a new gene to make shiga toxin, which
causes shigella dysentery when carried by a different bug.
</P>
<P>
The borrowed shiga toxin, when combined with the native ability
of E.coli to proliferate in the intestine, can trigger the
signature symptoms of the new food-borne outbreaks: Watery
diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria are most often passed from the fences of animals
to the surface of poorly butchered meat.
</P>
<P>
E. coli O157:H7 may cause 20,000 illnesses in the United States
each year, and 250-500 deaths, according to the Federal Center for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Additional 20,000 cases of food poisoning in the United States
may be caused by shiga toxin in other strains of bacteria, the
Federal Centers noted. There are an estimated seven million cases
of food poisoning a year from all causes, accounting for several
thousand deaths.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Japan and the United States, The New York Times
said, Outbreaks of food poisoning caused by E. coli Bacteria also
occurred in recent years in Australia, Africa and Europe. So the
fierce microbe is a rising worldwide problem, the newspaper
warned.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Central Organ of the Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution today strongly condemned
the attempt to take over power through illegal means in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held today at the OAU
headquarters, Salim Ahmed Salim, OAU secretary general, said the
OAU central organ warned against any attempt to overthrow the
legitimate government of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
The central organ called upon member states and the
international community to prepare themselves to isolate
completely any such regime which could take over leadership in
Burundi through the use of force or any illegal means.
</P>
<P>
"In such an event, member states and the international
community should also be prepared to impose sanctions against the
regime," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said concerned by the grave situation in Burundi, he has
been actively involved in consultations with many African leaders
to closely address the development.
</P>
<P>
If there is a coup against the legitimate government, and
fighting and killing continues, there is no alternative other
than intervention, Salim stressed.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Army Stages Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army today
announced a coup and reinstated former military leader Major
Pierre Buyayo as president, ousting Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya, reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gunfire erupted throughout the central African country's
capital Bujumbura, and the army set up road blocks across the city
and moved into the state TV station, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's borders and airports have been closed until further
notice, Defense Minister Colonel Firmin Sinzoyiheba said on
national radio, Agence France Presse news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hutu President Ntibantunganya fled to the U.S. ambassador's
residence in the capital on Tuesday evening in fear of his life
after the mainly Tutsi-led opposition withdrew support for him and
after rumors of a coup d'etat by the country's military which is
dominated by the minority Tutsi race.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
said that the international community would not accept the army
coup.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general strongly urges all concerned to uphold
the constitution and to bear in mind that the international
community will on no account accept a change of government by
force or other illegitimate means in Burundi," U.N. spokeswoman
Sylvana Foa said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ntibantunaganya spoke on national radio
appealing for calm and saying there was "no question" of him
stepping down, AFP reported.
</P>
<P>
And army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani had earlier
denied a possible putsch, saying that "If the army wanted to do a
putsch, it could have done it long time ago."
</P>
<P>
Ethnic fighting between the majority Hutus and the minority
Tutsis broke out in 1993 after the country's first democratically
elected Hutu president was murdered. More than 100,000 people are
estimated to have died in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Tutsis control the main towns, security forces and key
political and business decisions, but make up only 14 percent of
the country's 5.5 million population, against the Hutus' 85
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, who leads the Tutsi
opposition party UPRONA (Union for National Progress), formed a
coalition government with President Ntibantunaganya's Hutu-backed
FRODEBU party (Front for Democracy in Burundi) in 1994, in attempt
to prevent a genocide similar to that in neighboring Rwanda, where
a bloody civil war in 1994 led to the deaths of an estimated 1
million people.
</P>
<P>
But earlier today Nduwayo said he would quit after failing to
reach agreement with Ntibantunaganya.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, which was "extremely concerned" about
the situation in Burundi, has asked its staff in Burundi to leave,
reports say.
</P>
<P>
France has urged the United Nations Security Council to send a
mission to the violence-plagued country, the French Foreign
Ministry was reported as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases Palestinian Woman Prisoner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- One of the two famous
Palestinian women prisoners, pardoned by Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, was released from jail today after promising not to carry
out "further acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Inam Jabari, 25, was sentenced to 12-year imprisonment as a
minor for murdering a Jewish student in a Jerusalem park in
1988. She was freed today after signing a commitment forswearing
future attacks on the Jews.
</P>
<P>
President Weizman, in a conciliatory move to solve one of the
sore points in Israeli-Palestinian ties, pardoned early this month
Jabari and another woman prisoner, May Ghossein.
</P>
<P>
Ghossein, 24, was sentenced to life imprisonment for stabbing
to death a Jewish student in Jerusalem in 1991 and for later
murdering a Palestinian cell inmate in jail.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghossein has refused to leave prison while her
Palestinian inmates were still in jail. In the past, other women
prisoners in Israeli jails who were eligible for release also
opted to remain in prison to show solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Weizman delivered the promise of pardoning the two women in a
letter sent to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met in Cairo last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Supreme Court of Justice early this week rejected
the petitions by several rightist Jewish groups which argued the
release would abandon the imprisonment as a deterrent to
Palestinian murders.
</P>
<P>
The previous Israeli government led by Prime Minister Shimon
Peres had promised Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser
Arafat that all 36 Palestinian women prisoners would be freed. But
Weizman then refused to pardon the two women.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the women has been one of the major disputes
between Israel and the PA, which charged Israel for violating the
Oslo Accords by refusing to release the women prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords, Israel will release several thousand
Palestinian prisoners in three stages. The final arrangements are
expected to be worked out in the final status talks, which opened
in early May but have been stalled since Israel's May 29
elections.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Amputees To Be Treated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 25 (Xinhua) - Sixty-one Sierra Leonean amputees
are to be treated by a two-man French medical team, diplomatic
sources in the capital said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, a final evaluation report will be
carried out in December involving the amputees who were victims
of the five year long rebel war in the west African state.
</P>
<P>
The amputees, 16 female and 45 males, including a 7-year-old
boy, Lahai Bockari, were brought to Bo in the south by the
Belgian-based Medecins Sams Frontieres (MSF) from 32 chiefdoms
including Moyamba, Bonthe, Pujehum and Kenema districts.
</P>
<P>
The French medical team including a specialist surgeon Didei
Pilliard, spent three days in Bo last week, giving initial
treatment to the victims.
</P>
<P>
French assistance to the amputees came as a result of a visit
in March of the French Secretary of State in charge of
humantarian action, Xavier Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
Medical authorities say the number of amputees who are victims
of the rebel war is over 200 but independent sources said the
figure could be more.
</P>
<P>
"Many have not been to hospitals but have used herbal
treatment for their wounds while others have died when their
wounds became infested," the surgeon said.

UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged all parties
concerned in Burundi to show restraint and prevent a new outbreak
of violence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Burundi, Boutros-Ghali expressed deep concern
with reports that the Armed forces of Burundi have overthrown the
legitimate coalition Government and announced the installation of
a new president.
</P>
<P>
He strongly urged all concerned to uphold the constitution and
to bear in mind that the international community will on no

illegitimate means in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The Armed Forces should also recognize that a coup d'etat will
not solve any of Burundi's problems and is only likely to
intensify violence on all sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general expressed support for calls for a
regional summit meeting that should be urgently convened to
discuss ways of calming the situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which issued a presidential statement on
Burundi after consultations Wednesday, discussed the situation in

<HEADLINE> EU, Asian Top Officials Begin Talks on Trade, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Top officials from Europe and
Asia began talks today on promoting trade and investment between
the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from 25 countries, including the 15 member
states of the European Union, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea
and the seven ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
nations are holding two days of talks in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a follow-up of the first Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) in Bangkok last March, which called for an informal senior
officials' meeting on ways to promote economic cooperation between
the two regions and liberalize trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The officials will discuss the liberalization of investment at
world level, and aim to issue an action plan to promote investment
at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to prepare the groundwork for a strategy to
reduce regulatory barriers that hinder exports between the two
regions.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade relations between Europe and Asia are
becoming increasingly important. EC statistics show that the EU's
trade with Asia countries stood at 312.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1994, compared with 235 billion dollars with the United States in
the same year.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Passes Bill on Exclusive Economic Zone off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Assembly
today adopted a bill on the country's 200-nautical-mile exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) ahead of mid-August talks with Japan over
fixing EEZ boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The issue is a major sticking point in relations between the
two countries. Both South Korea and Japan said they would declare
their own EEZ around their coasts in February after a row over two
islets midway between them in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea obliges signatories
to respect a 200-mile (370 kilometers) exclusive economic zone off
a nation's coasts, including those of outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
Japan's parliament approved a bill on a 200-nautical-mile
exclusive economic zone off its coasts on July 2.
</P>
<P>
But as the sea between South Korea and Japan is less than 400
nautical miles wide, the zones overlap, making it necessary for
the two sides to negotiate boundaries.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Presents New Negotiation Approach To US Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met with U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross
here this afternoon and presented him a new approach to
negotiations with Syria, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Ross flew here from Amman, Jordan, this morning following a
visit to Syria, where he consulted with President Hafez al-Assad
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A somber-faced Netanyahu told the TV that Dennis Ross had come
at his invitation. "I asked Mr. Ross to come here because I would
like to seek possibilities vis-a-vis our partner of Syria in this
case. And the U.S. can help in a number of ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office did not invite any resident
foreign journalists to cover the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ross was believed to tell Netanyahu what the Syrians think
about the stalled peace process. Al-Assad has made it clear
recently that Israel should announce to give back the Golan
Heights before he returns to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
According to the TV report, Netanyahu rebuffed the request
saying that "forget it," meaning that he is not going to return
the Golan to Syria.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu indicated that an idea of "south Lebanon first"
has now cropped up. Israel has long offered to pull out of the
Israeli self-styled "security zone," to let the Lebanon Army in
Beirut take charge, disarm the Hezbollah guerrillas and prevent
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, Israel believes that al-Assad will
not agree because Syria wants to try bleeding the Israeli troops
in south Lebanon, as a means to pressure Israel for the return of
Golan.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the radio said Syria is responsible for Israel's
continued presence in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister David Levy
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
It appears that while the Palestinian-Israeli track of peace
talks has been revived, the Syrian track still faces many
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Netanyahu Wednesday, French Foreign
Minister Harve de Charette also failed in persuading the
rightwing Israeli leader to trade land for peace with
Syria. Prior to his trip here, the French minister also toured
Damascus and Amman in an effort to revitalize the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows to Prevent Spread of Deadly Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today vowed to take every conceivable means to prevent
the further spread of deadly food poisoning caused by a group of
e. coli bacteria known as O-157.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has so far killed seven people and left more than
8,000 others, mostly school children, ill since the first
small-scale outbreaks of the disease in May in Okayama, western
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto issued a statement declaring his government's
determination to fight the mass poisoning following an emergency
meeting of cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The issue...is a national problem that has entered deeply into
Japanese people's lives," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government is doing its best to investigate the path of the
epidemic by investigating the distribution channels of food that
may have caused the poisoning, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed issuing instructions to local
governments on preventive measures, including stricter hygiene
controls on school lunches.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, officials in the western Japanese city of
Sakai, where more than 6,000 school children have fallen victim to
the epidemic since early July, said the virulent bacillus had not
been found in lunches served during the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
A city task force has analyzed 1,352 school lunches served from
July 10 to 12 in all 90 of the city's elementary schools, food
collected from some 60 suppliers, as well as tap water and dust
collected from school kitchens, but no traces of the O-157
bacillus had been found, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The task force will investigate distributors and producers of
food in a bid to determine the route of the infection, the
officials added.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Arrives in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League Ahmed Esmat Abdul-Meguid arrived here this afternoon for a
three-day official visit to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meguid was received at the Beirut International Airport by
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and they have started
talks in the latter's office in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meguid is expected to meet with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the airport, Meguid underlined his
happyness to visit Lebanon, noting that he wants to "reiterate the
Arab League's support for Lebanon and Syria in the current
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit was aimed at additional consultations
with the Lebanese leaders on issues concerning Lebanon and the
Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the implementation of resolutions
taken in the Arab summit held on June 22-23 in Cairo, the Arab
League chief stressed that "the resolutions are in the course of
implementation."
</P>
<P>
He described the Arab summit, the first since the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis, as "successful."
</P>
<P>
"We should have to stand in one position and we have done
that," he emphasized, "the statements made by the Arab leaders
are united."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a reported Israel's proposal on a unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon, Meguid said that he will listen
to the Lebanese and Syrian brothers on this subject.
</P>
<P>
"If it is aimed at isolating Lebanon and Syria, this project
is doomed for failure," the Arab League chief said.

<HEADLINE> British Airway to Take Over French Air Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The British Airway (BA) will take
over the whole French air company of TAT by purchasing the
remaining 50.1 percent of its assets to meet competition across
the sky of Europe due to begin by April 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Michel Marchais, the founder of TAT, said today that BA will
spend 320 million francs (64 million U.S. dollars) to buy the rest
of the Tours-based TAT, and take care of a 600 million franc (120
million U.S. dollars) loss TAT has registered in the past two
fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
Marchais, who has been leading TAT for 30 years, said that he
is satisfied with the result of combination with BA in the past
three years, which he said has lowered 31 percent of TAT's costs.
</P>
<P>
France changed its civil aviation code in February to allow
foreign companies take over a French air company completely.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted a representative of BA in Paris as
saying that the French market is very important for BA. He said
that half of the TAT flights towards Britain "feed" long distance
flights from the Heathrow airport.
</P>
<P>
He said that when inter-European air competition begins in
April 1997, BA expects no new French competitors.

<P>
NICOSIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is taking
measures to prevent the spread of meningitis cases in some parts
of the island and calls on the public not to be panic.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were now 52 cases of meningitis,
most in the southern coastal town of Limassol, affecting
primarily young children under the age of two.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing today, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said that the government is
keeping a close eye on the cases of meningitis and is also
monitoring the steps taken for the elimination of any such
incidents.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking and shall continue to take all necessary
measures to prevent the spread of the disease, a viral infection
which has the tendency to affect very young children," said
Cassoulides, who is also a doctor by profession.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis, he explained, "is endemic in periods of high heat
and humidity as it is the case in the unusual period we are going
through now".
</P>
<P>
He said that in spite of concerns caused by the spread of the
virus, this was a mild form of viral meningitis which can be
treated medically.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say the 52 cases of meningitis constitute an
epidemic," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Manolis Christophides also stressed that "there
is no cause for concern," calling on the public not to be panic
as the cases can be effectively treated through medical care.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers to Receive Drug Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A national education campaign has
been instituted by Zambia's Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) to
educate people, particularly farmers on the dangers of growing
and using drugs.
</P>
<P>
Offices to this effect have been opened by the DEC campaign
division in the country's major cities and towns such as
Livingstone, Lusaka, Kabwe, Ndola and Kitwe.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted DEC Assistant Commissioner
Mukutulu Sinyani as saying, "it is not true to say that the DEC
is only concerned about arresting farmers who grow cannabis
without giving them alternative crops which are easy to grow. We
are working with the Ministry of Agriculture which is directly
involved in farming."
</P>
<P>
The DEC has rehabilitated more than 95 former Kachasu brewers
and drug dealers in Nkana, Kitwe, by giving them money to sell
food and agricultural products, according to Sinyani.
</P>
<P>
The DEC has launched drives in various forms to fight drug
cultivation, trafficking and abuse in the country.

<HEADLINE> Li Xiaoshuang Wins Olympic Gymnastics All-Around Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- World champion Li Xiaohuang stole
the limelight by awarding China the men's gymnastics all-around
title on 58.423 points at the Centennial Olympic Games here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese talented gymnast rallied back in the last event of
horizontal bar, beating Russia's Alexei Nemov to the second with a
slim margin of 0.049 who played his last routine of floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
Six-time Olympic gold medalist Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus, also
all-around defending champion, finished with the bronze in 58.197.
</P>
<P>
"Li's victory tonight is very important to us because it is the
first ever gold medal for China in the Olympic gymnastics
all-around events," said Chinese head coach Qian Kui.
</P>
<P>
"It will surely inspire us to step out of the shadow of those
miserable failures in the team events and to display our top form
in the individual finals later."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, three Chinese gymnates dropped from the horizontal
bar, allowing Russia to walk away with the men's team gold medal.
World championships winners China had to settle for the silver,
only lagging behind 1.239 points.
</P>
<P>
In the all-round finals, an evil omen seemed to beckon to China
anew when Li Xiaoshuang ranked only fifth after he slipped a step
in his first apparatus on the floor.
</P>
<P>
But the two-time Olympic vetaran kept clam to display his
top-notched calibre as one of the top favorites for the title.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoshuang overtook Nemov by 0.112 after the vault wherein
he scored his highest of 9.812 points.
</P>
<P>
Nemov regained his lead through the horizontal bar with a 9.800
performance, with Li chasing behind by 0.038 after a minor error
in his landing at the parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
After Nemov scoring 9.700 from the floor exercise, the majic
moment came when Li displayed his perfect performance on the
horizontal bar for 9.787 points.
</P>
<P>
With smile in his face, Li Xiaoshuang walked away the most
coveted gold medal in the gymnastics tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy and exciting by winning the gold medal," said
Li Xiaoshaung, "It is the most importent gold for an individual
gymnast while the team title is for a country."
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoshuang said he owes a lot to coach Huang Yubin before he
stepped in for the horizontal bar, his last apparatus in the
battle against Nemov.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, I don't care whoever is the rival, but I thought of
Nemov too much before I went on the bar tonight," Li said, "Should
he get 9.750 or more he will beat me."
</P>
<P>
"Then my coach came over and told me 'Don't think any more.
Just go ahead! Never look back!' I did as he told me, and my mind
was clean and my performance was perfect," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Nemov, a 20-yaer-old promising talent who stole the top spot in
the qualifying standing, said he did every thing he could but was
just unlucky in the running for the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I did my best today but was unlucky when I knew I lost the
gold by only 0.049 points," he said.
</P>
<P>
The women's all-around final will be held on Thursday.

BELGRADE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade authorities have
undertaken all necessary steps to fully control the infectious
animal foot-and-mouth disease in city area, a Belgrade city
councillor said today.
</P>
<P>
"In the area of Belgrade, there are about 150,000 head of
animals susceptible to this disease, and all measures have to be
taken to stop the epidemic disease from spreading to the city
territory," said Toma Jeftic, councillor in charge of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Strict precautions were necessary now that the acute disease of
the hoofed animals had been identified in the village of Ivanovo
outside Pancevo, 20 kilometers north of Belgrade, he said, adding
that two city districts bordering Ivanovo were declared threatened
areas.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav authorities are taking extensive measures to halt the
outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease which can also affect
humans.
</P>
<P>
The highly infectious disease was first founded in southern
province of Kosovo, which is bordering Macedonia and Albania two
weeks ago. Foot-and-mouth disease broke out in these two countries
last month.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Republican Agriculture Minister Petar Kostic
confirmed today that the disease had spread through smugglers'
channels from Albania into Kosovo, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug

The Yugoslav army general staff officials said recently the
army had stepped up border security measures, especially in the
areas which the affected cattle can easily cross, and organized
the monitoring and control of the situation in the jeopardized
regions in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Foreign Minister Meets Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara held talks today with visiting Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat in the Syrian port city of Latakia.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the talks were Farouk Kaddoumy, Director of
the Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), and other Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Syrian sources close to the talks disclosed on
condition of anonymity that Arafat had conveyed to the Syrian
foreign minister a verbal message from Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the message was entrusted to Arafat
during his meeting with Levy on Tuesday, which expressed the
Israeli government's desire to pursue the peace process and to
resume the Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations in particular.
</P>
<P>
The two men also reviewed the Palestinian developments and the
future of the peace process in the light of recent changes in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the necessity of adhering to the principles of
the peace process on the basis of U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the land-for-peace principle
which was reaffirmed in the Cairo Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Latakia this noon on a visit seen here as a
thaw in relations between him and the Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two leader deteriorated when the
Palestinians signed peace accords with Israel in 1993. Syria
complained about the lack of coordination when the Palestinians
decided to ink the accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Assad today discussed the latest changes in the
region and ways of reviving the Middle East peace process stalled
by Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit today was preceded by a meeting between him and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Minister was reported to have asked Arafat
to tell Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al Shara that he was ready
to meet him "at any time and in any place."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here remain cautious about what Syria may
reply to Levy's offer. "No breakthrough should be expected since
the two sides still are apart far," said a political observer.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Christian Klees shattered the
world final record of the men's free rifle prone shooting, ending
the gold drought for Germany at the Centennial Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Klees evened the world record of 600 points in
the preliminaries and then kept his momentum to beat the world
final mark of 703.5 points by totolling 704.8.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Beliaev of Kazakhstan, fourth in the qualification
round, shot the best final score of 105.3 for a total of 703.3 to
pick up the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Left-handed Jozef Gonzi of Slovakia, only second to the German
in the preliminaries with one point short, felt his left palm hurt
midway in the final. He finished third at 701.9 to win the first
Olympic medal for Slovakia which won independence just three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Klees said he did not feel pressure throughout the final and
even became more relaxed before the last shot, which had cost his
compatriot Petra Horneber a gold medal in the women's air rifle
event last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Beliaev had a different feeling: "I feel pressured, and only
pressure can make me shoot better," he said through interpreter.
</P>
<P>
"Shooting has changed my life, my characters," the 36-year-old
mine engineer said. "I do things more seriously now."
</P>
<P>
Conci, a soldier in the Slovak army, said he was proud of
winning the first Olympic medal for Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what color the medal is," he said. "This is the
first, I made the history, I am really proud of it."

these topics in the first half of 1997.

This is the first high level meeting which held overall

Ramallah, West Bank, this afternoon and adopted a number of

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Tanzania has

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Says No Changes in Israel's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here tonight that no changes have taken place in
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu's policy.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting with visiting Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid, Boueiz said that "until the
moment nothing has changed in Netanyahu's policy not even the
style of expressing it."
</P>
<P>
"As long as the policy denies the peace process as determined
in Madrid, we would not be optimistic about a quick re-start of
this process," the Lebanese foreign minister told a joint press
conference with Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz and Meguid had their meeting in the Beirut Foreign
Ministry after the Arab League chief arrived here this afternoon
for a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister said that Lebanon would not be
encouraged until Israel clearly announced its commitments to the
Madrid conference's bases, to the goal of a just, comprehensive
and permanent peace in the region, to the implementation of
U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and to the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz denied that his government has received anything
regarding what is called "Lebanon First" proposal reportedly put
forward by the Israeli Likud prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Israel's press said that the proposal, under which the Jewish
state will pull its troops out of south Lebanon in exchange
for a disarmament of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and an extension of Lebanon's control on the area, has been
refused by Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League's secretary general, on the other hand,
welcomed an implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution
425 if the "Lebanon First" proposal means that.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome an Israeli withdrawal, but the problem is not one
of slogans and if the words on the Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon is aimed at sowing dissension between Lebanon and
Syria, that will never succeed," Meguid stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief is expected to have meetings with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on
Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Denies NP's Possible Alliance With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's official
opposition National Party (NP) Leader F W De Klerk today denied
speculation that his party was quietly shifting to the right of
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters in the Pretoria Press Club in his first
public speech as leader of the opposition, De Klerk said
speculations of the NP's possible alliance with the Freedom Front
and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The NP is not seeking any formal alliance with any
party at this stage," adding that it, instead, is striving to
increase its black support base, and to change the present ethnic
pattern of South African politics.
</P>
<P>
The NP withdrew from the African National Congress (ANC)
controlled government of national unity on June 30 because it
claimed that the new constitution did not provide the
power-sharing mechanism in the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, De Klerk said not everybody who had voted for
the ANC are happy about the direction the anc is taking. These
people shared the NP's concerns about unemployment and the lack
of law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his talks with IFP Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
on Tuesday, De Klerk said the meeting was merely aimed at
expanding cooperation between the NP and parties on issues where
common ground existed.

<HEADLINE> Wild Falcons Smuggled out of Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Wild falcons on the verge of
extinction in Turkey are being caught by Syrian hunters and
smuggled to Arab countries through the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The allegations have been made by officials of the Hunting
and Protection of Wild Life Foundation, a watchdog group
monitoring hunting in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The organization has outlined methods and routes it maintains
are used in wild bird smuggling.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation, Syrian hunters come to Turkey
to hunt wild birds every year between April and August.
</P>
<P>
The birds are taught to hunt mice, birds and other
animals, and then they are transported to Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries and sold to Arab
sheiks for exorbitant prices.

<HEADLINE> IFP Denies Speculation of Being in Disarray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) today dismissed media portrayals of the party as being in
disarray and facing a crisis ahead of its annual national
congress at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Durban, IFP spokesman Themba Nzimande
said the IFP had become accustomed to unsubstantiated media
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The media had over the years wrongly assumed they had the
right to "set the agenda and the resolutions" of the IFP
congresses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IFP's annual national congress is scheduled to take place
in Ulundi this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the usual deliberations, the forthcoming IFP
congress will thoroughly consider the party's future in the
changing political environment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nzimande said the congress would try to redefine the party's
role in the government of national unity following the National
Party's withdrawal from the government on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports said the IFP might follow the NP's suit
to withdraw from the government and form an alliance with the NP.
</P>
<P>
However, a meeting between IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and
NP leader F. W. de Klerk on Tuesday only turned out that the two
parties agreed to continue "informal cooperation" in
Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nzimande said: "the issue of an IFP pullout from
the government has not been discussed whatsoever within the
party structures."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, any speculation in this respect lacked foundation,
he added.

HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Burglaries on Hong Kong Island
dropped by 14 percent in the first six months of this year, a
police spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The number of burglaries fell from 1,365 in the first half of

in the corresponding months last year and 8,192 in the latter half
of 1995, he said.

According to the spokesman, the number of illegal immigrants
arrested for crimes has dropped to 988 in the first half of this
year from 1,349 in the second half of 1995.

PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Bob Denar, the celebrated French
mercenary who spent half a century fighting in the African
jungles, said today he will quit because of physical and
psychological fatigue.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old, just released on parole from the Sante prison
in downtown Paris, told interviewers he would put all his bullets
in a museum because "physically and psychologically" he is not fit
to fight again.
</P>
<P>
Fighting last year in the Comoros was for him, the war to end
all wars.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that some units of the French army were, "if not
participants", at least completely informed about last year's
armed operation which deposed the island's president Said Mohammed
Djohar.
</P>
<P>
Denar was detained for nine months and 10 days for murdering
Comoran President Ahmed Abdalla in Moroni in 1989. He was then
chief of the presidential guard of the Indian Ocean island nation.
</P>
<P>
He will attend a court hearing on August 6 on the case and is
now barred from leaving France.
</P>
<P>
Denar also expressed bitterness toward the French government
saying, "It (France) joins the game, but we are the dirty
cannonballs.
</P>
<P>
"One should not expect the laureates, nor even much dough," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The old war horse said that he wants to return to the Comoros,
where eight of his "adopted" children were born. "It is my home
and I have Comoran citizenship."

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Opens Another 3 Ports of Entry for Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Three new ports of entry built
by south China's Guangdong Province with a total investment of 200
million yuan have passed state appraisal and opened for service
today.
</P>
<P>
The three new ports of Zhuhai, Yangjiang and Xintang in
Zengcheng are among the country's category-A ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has long been concerned with the
construction of ports and has made energetic efforts to provide
financial support, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
So far, the management of ports of entry in the province has
become more intensive and efficient, due to improved layout of
ports and readjustment of the state category-B ports of entry
which have poor economic performances.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Underlines Support for Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League (AL) Ahmed Esmat Abdul-Meguid today underlined the AL's
support for Lebanon in pursuing a just and comprehensive peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are making efforts for the just and comprehensive peace
in the region, for the realization of stability and Israel's
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab lands, and this is our firm
position at present," Meguid told reporters after meeting with
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief, on the second day of his official visit
in Beirut, also held talks today with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Lebanese official sources said that Meguid
discussed with the two Lebanese leaders the Arab solidarity,
developments in the Middle East peace process and implementation
of resolutions of the recent Arab summit in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Meguid called for the implementation of all relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 425 which
demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the so-called "Lebanon First" proposal raised by
Israel was aimed at "sowing dissensions between Lebanon and Syria
and that will impossibly be achieved."
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, Israel suggested a pullout of its troops from
south Lebanon in exchange for the disarmament of Lebanon's
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the extension of the
Lebanese government's control to all its territories.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal, the AL chief said that he welcomed
the proposal if it means the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon
in accordance with Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
"But if it is aimed at sowing dissensions between Lebanon and
Syria, the proposal is unacceptable and is doomed to failure,"
Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Arabs are exerting efforts to implement the
resolutions of the last Arab summit, which was held in Cairo on
June 22-23 and focus on Arab solidarity and joint actions to face
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs feared that Israeli hardline policy might jeapordize
the Middle East peace process, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's last week visit to Cairo and a meeting between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy have eased to some extent the Arab anxiety.
</P>
<P>
Meguid stressed that his current visit to Lebanon, as well as
the visit he will start to Syria on Sunday, "come within this
framework."

<HEADLINE> Shooting Victims Identified In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The victims of today's drive-by
shooting attack have been officially identified, according to an
announcement by Eric Bar-Chen, Foreign Press Liaison Officer of
the Israeli Public Security Ministry here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Uri Munk, aged 60, and his daughter-in-law Rachel Munk, 25,
were killed. His 30-year-old son, Ze'ev Munk, driving the car,
was critically wounded and is still in hospital. Munk's wife
Eliza was released from hospital after treatment for shock.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at about 1:30 a.m. today near
Mashav Tirosh on the road between Beit Shemesh and Re'em
junction, just inside the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani came to the scene
this afternoon and said that police ballistic test had
confirmed connection between this attack and the prior attack on
the same road and another attack killing an army doctor and
a soldier on the Hebron-Jerusalem Road on January 16, 1996.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for today's attack so far,
but the Israelis openly blamed the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine based in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The radical Palestininian group has made no response to the
charge.

<HEADLINE> Collectively-Owned Assets to be Checked up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China will begin a drive this year
to determine the asset value and check up its structure and
efficiency of urban collectively-owned enterprises and units.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent State Council notice, the campaign covers
all collectively-owned enterprises registered with industrial and
commercial administrations at all levels and departments, and also
units that run collectively-owned assets in various forms.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to produce more accurate data on the asset value
and structure, as well as the economic performance of urban
collectively-owned enterprises and units, the notice says.
</P>
<P>
The effort, which is also meant to help improve property
management and economic reforms and development in the
collectively-owned sector, will focus on securing detailed data on
collectively-owned assets, sorting out creditors and debtors,
re-evaluating the major fixed assets, and defining and registering
property rights.
</P>
<P>
"The eventual objective is to solve the problem of an unclear
record of the status quo of property value and make-up in the
collectively-owned sector and thereby halt the wasting and loss of
property," the notice says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that such an effort, to be supervised by the
Ministry of Finance, the State Economic and Foreign Trade
Commission (SEFTC), and the State Administration of Taxation
(SAT), will help build a solid foundation for the reform and
development of the collectively-owned enterprises and for the
establishment of a modern corporate system.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for the project were made at a joint meeting of
the Ministry of Finance, the SEFTC and SAT, the notice adds.

<HEADLINE> Perez Wins Ecuador's First Gold at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Jefferson Perez of Ecuador upset
many big names to win the men's 20-kilometer walk gold medal here
this morning in the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
This is the first gold medal that Ecuador has ever won in the
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
Perez's winning time was one hours 20 minutes and 7 seconds,
about 14 seconds faster than his personal best.
</P>
<P>
Ilya Markov of Russia won the silver in 1:20:16 ahead of world
best time setter Bernardo Segura of Mexico, 1:20:23.
</P>
<P>
Starting on a cool early morning, a field of 61 walkers
launched the gruellling battle with Igor Kollar of Slovakia
leading as a rabbit in the opening stages.
</P>
<P>
About 23 minutes later, the big bunch caught up Kollar and
rolled forward together with Rishat Shafikov of Russia and China's
Li Zewen, World Cup winner last year, leading the pace.
</P>
<P>
Perez, Markov and Segura just followed Shafikov and Li
comfortably and passed the first 10 kilometer point in 40:59.
</P>
<P>
Shafikov, whose best time this season was 1:19:13, used a
higher gear to break away from the field and built up a big 15
second lead in the following two kilometers.
</P>
<P>
At that time, only seven persons could hang on in the second
squad and Li has faded for good.
</P>
<P>
After 15 kilometers, Shafikov still remained a clear leader and
never looked back to stride on, leaving Segura, who set a 1:17:25
world best two years ago, and Perez, South American champion last
year, battling against Markov.
</P>
<P>
With two kilometers to ago, Shafikov was given a warning by a
referee and that forced him to slow his pace. Markov passed the
18km mark in 1:12:29 with Perez and Segura close at his heels.
</P>
<P>
In the final 1,000 meters, Perez found a higher gear to get rid
of his rivals and walked into the stadium first for a surprising
victory.
</P>
<P>
Shafikov finished fifth in 1:20:41 and Li wound up 28th in
1:25:28.
</P>
<P>
A total of six walkers including early rabit Koller and Julius
Sawe of Kenay were disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Japan's White Paper Urges Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy will slip back to
the marginal growth level of the early 1990s unless the
productivity of its less export-oriented manufacturers and
service-sector corporations is improved, a government report
warned today.
</P>
<P>
The report also called for complete deregulation of the
country's service sector.
</P>
<P>
Japan will continue to be shackled with the yen's appreciation,
a massive current-account surplus and price disparity between
many goods at home and abroad, unless those enterprises become
more efficient, said the Fiscal 1996 Economic White Paper compiled
by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA).
</P>
<P>
The annual report said manufacturers of food, textiles and
other internationally less competitive goods must specialize in
higher value-added products and expand their imports of low-end
products from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Increased imports will help bring down the politically
sensitive current-account surplus and also alleviate upward
pressure on the yen, the EPA document said.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, which comprises distributors and other
non-manufacturers and accounts for 60 percent of Japan's gross
domestic product, must be thoroughly deregulated, it said.
</P>
<P>
Lowering the high costs of such services as transportation,
construction and communications, will help narrow price
differentials between domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the paper said, Japan must find ways to achieve
improved productivity and lower unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The report, the 50th of its kind, said the Japanese economy,
which enjoyed strong post-war growth, now finds itself in a
"period of historical structural adjustment."
</P>
<P>
But it did not recommend specific measures the government
should take to achieve proposed reforms in order to revive the
nation's economic dynamism.
</P>
<P>
Adjustments need to be made in response to the collapse of the
"bubble" economy of spiralling stock and land prices in the late
1980s, for the period of yen appreciation, for "megacompetition"
in global markets and for the aging population, the EPA paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since conventional catch-up type economic structures, systems
and policies have failed to cope with such new challenges, Japan
has fallen into "strikingly exceptional low growth" for past four
years, it said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's real gross domestic product grew 2.3 percent in fiscal
1995 after posting increases below 0.5 percent in fiscal 1992-94.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 26 (Xinhua) - Italy's government is planning to
introduce a 500,000-lire bank note, worth about 330 U.S. dollars,
five times the largest note currently in circulation, Prime
Minister Romano Prodi said today.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to mint coins for 1,000 lire
(66 cents), the average price of a cup of coffee in a bar, and
2,000 lire (1.31 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prodi said his cabinet had adopted a draft law on the new
denominations which would go to parliament.
</P>
<P>
Italians currently have to carry large bags of paper money with
them to shopping for major cash purchases, for the country only
has bills for 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 50,000 and 100,000 lire
(0.66, 1.31, 3.3, 6.56, 33 and 65.6 dollars respectively).
</P>
<P>
The highest denomination coin is 500 lire (0.33 dollars).

their marriages were happy, and 50 percent said that their current

Sunday, the 20th anniversary of the quake, will be an uneasy

<P>
TANGSHAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The disaster in north China's
city of Tangshan in 1976 has resulted in reorganization of
families among widows and widowers who lost their spouses in the
earthquake that claimed 240,000 lives and injured 524,000.
</P>
<P>
Most of the citizens were asleep when the ground began shaking
in the early morning hours 20 years ago. In seconds, spouses lost
spouses and children became orphans, as hundreds of thousands of
families were shattered.
</P>
<P>
But in the ruins of the devastated city, survivors worked to
overcome their pain by forging new friendships and finding new
loves.
</P>
<P>
One year after the quake, most of the young widows and widowers
in Tangshan had re-married with help from their matchmaking
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
"People felt the urgent need to seek support and comfort by
setting up new families," sociologist Wang Ziping said, explaining
why a remarriage boom surged in the city soon after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Their marriages were, to some extent, created by tragedy,"
Wang said. "Almost every remarried couple spent their honeymoon
with painful memories of their deceased spouses and better hopes
for their futures."
</P>
<P>
A primary school teacher who lost her husband in the quake
said, "On our wedding night, my new husband and I couldn't help
sobbing because we missed our loved ones so deeply."
</P>
<P>
"But later we calmed down and comforted each other. Both of us
knew we needed a family to go on living," she said.
</P>
<P>
Like them, many remarried couples not only devoted themselves
to rebuilding their hometown, but also tried to create new
families.
</P>
<P>
Cui Lili lost her husband in the quake when she was seven
months' pregnant, and gave birth to her son in a quake-proof
shed. Later, she married engineer Zhou Dexing, whose wife was
killed in the disaster. His three-year-old daughter survived.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I realized only one thing could help me to make
my new family's relationships more harmonious. That was love," Cui
said.

<HEADLINE> High Attention Urged for Supply of Farming Capital Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Chen Junsheng has
called on various localities to pay greater attention to reforming
the circulation system of agricultural capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also head of All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing
Cooperatives, made the call at a national conference on the
circulation of agricultural capital goods, which ended in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said that the major means of farming
production, such as seeds, fertilizer and machinery, are the
essential guarantee for agricultural production. Failure to
circulate them not only will affect the farmers' initiative and
grain output, but also will obstruct the healthy cycle of national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of assuring farmers nationwide about
the supply of farming capital goods, particularly the store of
chemical fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Chen asked the supply and marketing cooperatives at various
levels to increase their sense of responsibility when dealing with
circulation of farming capital goods and to resolutely curb
irregularities in management, including selling fake and shoddy
farming goods.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu asks PNA to Act against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu called here today on the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to take actions against terrorism after two Israelis were
killed in a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
In a cabinet meeting held this morning, Benjamin Netanyahu
instructed the security forces to trace down the gunmen responsible
for the attack early this morning near Beit Shemesh.
</P>
<P>
A father and his daughter-in-law were killed and his son was
critically wounded by gunmen who opened fire at their car, Israel
Radio reported. The man's wife was unhurt in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports by the radio claimed the couple were killed
and their son was critically wounded, while the daugther-in-law
escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israeli security forces would use new
technical devices to detect the perpetrators of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also demanded that the PNA take specific
actions to crack down all organizations involved in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed that Israel would take immediate actions against
all extremist groups, mentioning the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) by name.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the PFLP based in Damascus, Syria's capital, for
today's drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that the radical organization had launched
several similar attacks in Beit Shemesh area in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops today re-imposed a closure of the West Bank,
especially the flashpoint town of Hebron, which is believed to be
a base for some radical anti-Israeli Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
Israel cealed the West Bank in early March following suicide
bomb attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet also demanded the PNA take actions to close
down Palestinian institutions in east Jerusalem, Israel's
self-claimed eternal and indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
The latest attack is the second drive-by shooting incident
in Beit Shemesh area in less than two months. On June 9, an Israeli
couple were killed, but their seven-month-old son was
luckily unhurt. the PFLP was also held responsible for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has repeatedly urged the PNA to prove its
capability to combat violence, saying future progress of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks depended on its anti-terrorism
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Strongman Opposes Foreign Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's new military-backed Tutsi
leader Pierre Buyoya today urged foreign powers not to intervene
in his country and vowed to restore peace to the tiny African
nation, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
"I have never thought that this ethnic conflict will be solved
through foreign intervention," said Buyoya at his first press
conference in Bujumbura, according to a report by Agence France
Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
In a radio speech to the nation late Thursday night after
ousting Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in a bloodless
coup, Buyoya said that his priority is to stop the massacres and
bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who has been installed by the army as an interim
president, called on the international community to "understand
the sense of his action", which he said is to save "a people in
distress".
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been ravaged by three years of ethnic war between
the minority Tutsis and Hutus who make up 85 percent of the
African country's 5.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
The coup has been condemned by the United Nations, the United
States and the Organization of African Unity. The European Union
today announced it was suspending aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
France is one of the few major powers not to have condemned the
coup. It reacted to Thursday's events by urging "national
reconciliation".
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
today that the French ambassador in Bujumbura Jean-Pierre Lajaunie
met Buyoya before and after the putsch on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian capital Bujumbura looks calm today. The people
of Bujumbura seem to be leading a normal life, although the
presence of the army is everywhere, said a report from AFP.
</P>
<P>
But little is known about the situation in the provinces, where
the Hutu guerrillas have been fighting the Tutsi-dominated
government forces.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Party Calls for Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The controversial constitutional
changes introduced by the Zambian government recently should have
been put to a referendum, Zambia Democratic Congress (ZADECO)
Vice President Kusuka Mutukwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mutukwa, in Zimbabwe on private family business, said, "let's
go for a referendum and see if the majority are in favor of some
of the elements in the constitution as claimed by the MMD
(Movedment for Multi-Democracy) party."
</P>
<P>
The constitutional changes bar second-generation Zambians from
contesting presidency and limit presidential terms to two. They
also bar chiefs from participating in politics.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Freberick Chiluba has declined efforts by
his southern African colleagues to help diffuse the
constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mutukwa, whose party is led by Dean Mungomba, a former
minister in Chiluba's government, said the changes were attempts
by the MMD to stop former Zambian president and leader of the
United National Independence Party (UNIP) Kenneth Kaunda from
standing for elections scheduled for October this year.
</P>
<P>
His party, formed a year ago, is an alternative to both the
MMD and UNIP.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed only Zambians could "save" their image,
criticizing the hiring of a foreign public relations firm to help
cleanse the image of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the MMD government which took over from Kaunda
in 1991 of having totally failed to develop the country.

<HEADLINE> New Quake-Proof City In Tangshan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The dust from the world's
deadliest quake in 1976 in north China's Tangshan City had no more
than settled, when planners turned their attention to building a
new quake-proof city.
</P>
<P>
The new city was to have the most solid foundation in the
country, scientists decreed, one that would withstand shock waves
measuring 7.8 or higher on the Richter Scale - like the one which
had just devastated Tangshan and claimed 240,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, the planners have realized their dream. A
new city, the first in the country to be able to survive a quake
of 8 on the Richter Scale, has risen pheonix-like from the ashes
and debris.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the new urban area that was not
suitable for anti-proof construction, was covered with green grass
and trees. Large patches of greenery can be used as landing fields
for helicopters in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Avoiding building on quake-active areas may be the best and
cheapest way to prevent losses from earthquakes, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, two years after the quake, experts from the country's
geological and construction departments and the State Seismic
Bureau came to the city to make a careful study on the 250
sq. km. space of Tangshan City, and collected a large amount of
materials.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chuanzhen, an expert from the Tangshan City Planning
Bureau, said that in the Lunan District, where the quake was very
intense, the death rate was more than 45 percent, twice the
average urban death rate.
</P>
<P>
The area is now covered with green grass and no permanent
buildings are allowed to be built here.
</P>
<P>
Experts made a survey on an eight km by 2.5 km gap left by the
quake in the urban area, and found that there were two sites of
older quakes 3.5 meters and seven meters deep under the earth,
which indicated that there had been quakes on the same site in
ancient times.

<HEADLINE> New Quake-Proof City Arose in Tangshan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hundred years' of mining activity in this industrial center
has left several large underground areas hollow, which have caused
the sinking of the earth's surface around Tangshan, and presented
another obstacle to the city's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that when the planners designed the new urban area,
they moved its center 25 km. northwest to a spot that had better
geological conditions and was in compliance with quake-proof
standards.
</P>
<P>
The city's political, economic, and cultural centers, major
residential areas, large public facilities and enterprises all
were located in more geologically-sound places.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises in the former urban area, including the
Tangshan Engine Factory, the first factory in the country to
produce a steam engine, have been moved to the new location. The
population in the reconstructed area is 60 percent of the city's
total.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan is surrounded by mountains which protected many
buildings during the deadly earthquake. The Workers' Recreation
Center, at the base of the mountains, sustained only minor damage
from the quake.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that the mountain areas usually are on more
solid foundations, sometimes entirely stone, which are especially
earthquake resistant. Most of the city's highrises were built
around the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Looking from the Fenghuang Mountain, which is in the center of
the city, ruins have been replaced by green grass and trees in the
east, where the local residents often come to spend their leisure
time. In the west, a number of high buildings have sprung up.
</P>
<P>
A tall monument was built in the center of the city to
commemorate the great struggle between the people of Tangshan and
the deadly natural disaster.

port city of Latakia for Gaza today.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A wider range of visitors
brought about 429 million HK dollars (55.4 million US dollars)
worth of business to the 28th Hong Kong Fashion Week, which closed
last Saturday, a spokesman of the Hong Kong Development Council
(TDC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
TDC's deputy senior manager Patrick Wong said the results of
the 28th Hong Kong Fashion Week had further enhanced Hong Kong's
position as a leading fashion sourcing center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Organized by TDC, the spring-autumn event attracted more than
15,000 buyers, of whom 5,270 came from 82 countries and regions, a
24 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Almost 80 percent of the overseas buyers arrived from across
Asia for the fashion and accessories trade fair, and Japanese
buyers were by far the most heavily represented, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
Together they placed on-the-spot orders amounting to 166
million HK dollars (21.4 million US dollars), up 35 percent from
last year, with another 263 million HK dollar (34 million US
dollars) worth of orders under negotiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 383 exhibitors from 27 countries and regions took
part in the four-day event at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center.

<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and local businesses pumped
in 253.7 million US dollars of investments during the first half
of 1996, an increase of 24 percent from last year's figure of 194
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This brought to more than 1.8 billion US dollars the total
investments registered by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority
(SBMA) since it was created in 1992 to convert the former US
military base into a commercial, industrial and freeport zone in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The 120 million US dollar investment of the Biwater

The amount of investment, which initially started in 1992 at
119 million US dollars, increased more than three-fold to 359
million US dollars the following year. In 1994 the freeport posted

MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government registered a budget surplus of
9.74 billion pesos (371.9 million US dollars) for the first half
of 1996, nearly 10 percent lower than the surplus of 10.81 billion
pesos (412 million dollars) in the year-earlier period. The
central bank said that the surplus was largely due to the 15.32
billion peso (580 million dollars) surplus in April, a result of
partial payment on the Fort Bonifacio Base, which was privatized
last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Export processing zones in the Philippines increased their
exports by 55.8 percent to 2.218 billion US dollars in the first
five months of this year, from 1.423 billion dollars in the same
period of 1995, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority said today.
</P>
<P>
-- San Miguel Corp., the Philippine food and beverage
conglomerate, reported worse-than expected results in the first
half of this year, including a 28 percent drop in net recurring
profit from a year earlier. The company's net recurring profit
dropped to 1.97 billion pesos (75.2 million US dollars) from 2.74
billion pesos (100 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Official's Speech on Macao Hailed as Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers in Macao today
praised a top Chinese official's speech on Macao as "encouraging"
and "enlightening".
</P>
<P>
The "Macao Daily News" commented the speech of Chen Ziying,
deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the
State Council, as inspiring, "showing that the (Chinese) Central
Government pays great attention to Macao."
</P>
<P>
Chen said in his Thursday's speech, which was entitled "'One
Country, Two Systems' Will Bring A Bright Future to Macao", that the
special policy will ensure the prosperity and stability of Macao. He
also urged that the resolvement of major issues of the transitional
period be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen promised that the Chinese Government will do
its best to help Macao in its economic growth, and that Macao-born
Portuguese will have the freedom to choose either a Chinese
citizenship or a Portuguese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The commentary in the "Macao Daily News" said that Chen's speech
on the role of Macao as a bridge between the mainland and other
parts of the world is a "proper description of the function of
Macao."
</P>
<P>
Other newspapers including the "Va Kio" and the "Tai Chung Pou"
said that the speech has increased Macao people's confidence in the
future after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Macao in
1999.
</P>
<P>
"People in Macao now become aware how earnest Beijing cares
about the economic expansion of Macao," said one commentary, "They
should have thereby increased confidence in the future stability and
economic growth in Macao."

As in the case of any language, Tibetan has been developed
along with the changes of the times. It has been greatly enriched
in the process of social progress, with the addition of a large
number of new words in philosophy, politics, the economy, science,
and technology.
</P>
<P>
When the Dalai Lama ruled Tibet, there were few schools in the
region and 95 percent of the people were illiterate. Those few
Tibetans who could read were mostly lamas who read only Buddhist
scriptures. But, Tibet now has thousands of schools that give
Tibetans access to their language, drastically reducing the
illiteracy rate.
</P>
<P>
We certainly should not talk about traditional culture without
mentioning literature. King Gesser, a ten-million-character
classic Tibetan folk epic, regarded as the crystallization of
wisdom of the Tibetan people, used to be found only in the oral
form among the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
After Tibet was liberated, the central government established
special institutes, whose purpose was to rescue, collect, collate
materials, and do research on the epic.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 tapes and three million books on the epic in
Tibetan have by now been published.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering, a Tibetan artist, has had exhibitions of his
paintings in the United States, Britain, India, and Spain,
attracting attention at each show.
</P>
<P>
"Your paintings not only show traditional Buddhist painting
techniques, but also show progress, which justifies the
development of Tibetan art in China." said O'kying, a Tibetan
living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, more than 20 Tibetan art troupes have
performed abroad, displaying the spectacular charm of the
traditional culture. In 1994, one troupe performed in several
European countries, and in Vienna the performance drew the
following comment from newspapers: "cultural ambassadors from the
roof of the world caused a hit in Vienna."
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, after enjoying the performance of the Shannan
Song and Dance Troupe, not a few Dutch people were heard to
remark, "Tibetan songs and dances are so marvellous, we cannot
understand when they say that 'Tibetan songs and dances have been
destroyed.'"
</P>
<P>
Tibetan artists, who were looked down upon and were homeless
when the Dalai Lama ruled Tibet, are now respected across the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- An article titled "Is This
Protection or Sabotage?", which is contributed by Xu Xingsheng
today, outlines current cultural affairs in the Tibet Autonomous
Region and says that Tibetan culture has a long history and strong
ethnic characteristics.
</P>
<P>
While touring Europe in the spring of 1996, the Dalai Lama
asserted that the traditional culture of Tibet has been destroyed
and that the study of traditional culture in the capital, Lhasa,
are subject to restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan ethnic group has gradually formed its unique
culture in the long process of historical development," the
article says, and asks, Has it been protected and developed or
destroyed since the liberation of Tibet in 1951?
</P>
<P>
And, what are the specific contents of traditional
culture? What do destruction and restriction refer to? The Dalai
Lama often talks ambiguously on these matters.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, universally-recognized traditional
culture refers to the spoken and written language.
</P>
<P>
Have these been destroyed or developed?
</P>
<P>
The 17-Article Agreement on peaceful liberation of Tibet signed
by China's central government and the Tibetan local government on
May 23, 1951, states that efforts will be made to develop the
spoken and written language of the Tibetan ethnic group, in
accordance with specific conditions in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The regulations on the study, use, and development of the
Tibetan language adopted by the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's
Congress in July 1987 stipulate that the Tibetan and Han languages
are equally important in Tibet, but with the Tibetan language
playing a dominant role.
</P>
<P>
"The position of the Tibetan language has been defined
according to law," the article noted, and decisions, regulations
and decrees adopted by the Regional People's Congress, and
official documents and notices issued by the regional government
use both the Tibetan and Han languages.
</P>
<P>
The two languages are also used in newspapers and TV and radio
broadcasts, and books written in the Tibetan Language account for
70 percent of those published in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In the hiring of factory and office workers and in accepting
students for enrollment, priority is given to those with a good
knowledge of the Tibetan Language.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language is also used for all major meetings. All
offices, street and road signs, and public facilities use signs
printed in the two languages, and the Tibetan Language is the
medium used to teach major courses in all schools.

Remarkable improvements have been made in Tibet's medical
care. In the past, when the Dalai Lama ruled Tibet, there were
only two poorly equipped small medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the central government
provided large sums of money for the development of Tibetan
medicine, and there are now a research institute for Tibetan
medicine, ten Tibetan medicine hospitals, three Tibetan medicine
pharmaceutical factories, and hospitals in 71 counties that have
Tibetan medicine departments. There are more than 1,000 people
working in Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
To expand the field, the regional government organized older
experienced medical personnel to compile medical books on
physiology, pathology, diet, and other topics.
</P>
<P>
In the field of Tibetology, there are more than 50 research
institutes in Tibet and elsewhere in China. The China Tibetology
Research Center was established in Beijing in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Research institutes cover such topics as Tibet's strategy of
economic and social development, its history, the collection of
Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, and research on different schools of
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 30 magazines in Tibetan, Chinese, and English
on such topics as Tibetan Studies, Tibetan Buddhism, Study of
Social Development in Tibet, Study of Tibetan Arts, Tibetan Folk
Customs, and Tibetan Culture, not to mention numerous books on
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the region has expanded its international
academic contacts, and nearly 200 foreign scholars and persons
with a Tibetan background have come to Tibet for academic
exchanges or scientific and research cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
A number of Tibetan scholars have been invited abroad for
visits, lectures, or academic conferences.
</P>
<P>
During the Seventh International Conference on Tibetology held
in Vienna in June of last year, many scholars said it was
encouraging to see that the research on Tibetology in China had
seen considerable progress in recent years.

The article notes that there are innumerable cultural relics in
Tibet and, since the late 1950s and early 1960s, organizations
have been set up in Tibet to examine sites, ancient buildings,
tombs, old stone tablets, and engravings.
</P>
<P>
An institute was set up to study the preservation of these, and
in 1990, Tibet passed a series of local regulations on protecting,
restoring, and administering cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
In 1961, 1982, and 1988, the Chinese government published a
list of 13 local cultural relics that were under state protection
and the regional government listed 11 sites under regional
protection.
</P>
<P>
After almost 30 years of study, items such as pieces of stone,
porcelain, bone, and seeds of rice from the Stone Age were
discovered in parts of Tibet, providing important clues and
research materials for studying the formation of Tibetans and
Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the state has allocated some 200 million yuan
(about 24 million US dollars) to help repair wall paintings and
engravings at Tibet's key cultural sites, including the Potala
Palace and Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, giving new lustre to old or
damaged relics.
</P>
<P>
The restoration program at the Potala Palace alone was the
largest and most costly project that China has so far undertaken
on ancient buildings, and was described by experts as a remarkable
event in the history of restoration.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama declared that China had undermined the religion,
but the fact is that religious activities in Tibet are back to
normal and the religious sites have been restored and preserved.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 1,700 religious sites in Tibet are open to the
public and religious books are well protected.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the local archives presented the Buddhist association
with a Tibetan-language version of "Tangyur", the complete works
of Zong Kaba, the founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Lamaism,
printed in Lhasa, and provided funds for the association to run a
printing house for religious works.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 1,000 copies of "Tangyur" have been printed for
lamaseries inside and outside Tibet.

The article said that this clearly shows that Tibetology has
been protected and not damaged, and that customs are a natural
part of traditional culture, which are changing with society.
</P>
<P>
Backward customs and those that do not keep up with the times
will be replaced by new ones, as is the case in every nation and
among every ethnic group, the article concluded.
</P>
<P>
What are the traditional customs that the Dalai Lama claims
have been destroyed ? the article asked.
</P>
<P>
In cities and towns, in rural and pastoral areas, over the past
several decades, the majority of Tibetans have basically
maintained the traditional customs and habits in their daily
lives, the article said, wearing traditional costumes, eating
traditional food, and live in Tibetan-style houses.
</P>
<P>
The article went on to say that, each year, Tibetan people have
celebrated traditional festivals, such as the Tibetan New Year,
the Xodoin Festival (a traditional dramatic festival), the Onggo
Festival, and the Dama Festival.
</P>
<P>
With the development of society, some changes have taken place
in people's everyday lives, the article said, with some Tibetans
wearing both Tibetan and Western clothing, some having moved to
buildings from tents, some using electric lights instead of butter
lamps, or using coal for fires instead of dried cow dung.
</P>
<P>
There are some customs and habits that have indeed disappeared,
the article added, such as in the past when lamas used human
skulls, human blood, or human intestines during recitations and
religious services.
</P>
<P>
The organs of unmarried girls were also used by temples
formerly as musical instruments, and these barbarous and cruel
traditional practices have been eliminated, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that in former times, serfs and ordinary people had to
get on their knees, bow, and stick their tongue out to show
respect to aristocrats when they saw them. This traditional but
outmoded practice has also been eliminated by Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Tibetans would invite lamas to recite scriptures
to avoid disasters, cure diseases, drive away plagues of locusts,
and remove the threat of hail or ill health.
</P>
<P>
The article said this practice has been abandoned by the Tibetan
people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Suggests "Lebanon First" Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has announced in recent occasions that Israel is ready
to resume negotiations with Syria over Israel's conditions for
withdrawal from south Lebanon, a proposal known as "Lebanon first."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has also brought up this suggestion during his talks
with Dennis Ross, U.S.coordinator for the Middle East peace
process, who is currently visiting the region and considering the
proposal as initiating the resumption of Israeli-Syrian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal calls for the disarming of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah (Party of God), the redeployment of the Lebanese armed
forces throughout the south Lebanese territory, and Syria's
guarantees to end the Hezbollah operations against Israel using
south Lebanon as a springboard.
</P>
<P>
Israel is repeatedly claiming that it has no ambitious designs
in Lebanese territories, but will maintain its forces in the
occupied border strip in south Lebanon, which is approximately
1,100 square kilometers, until it obtains guarantees regarding the
security of its northern borders.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, the Hezbollah-led
Lebanese Islamic anti-Israeli forces have carried out hundreds of
operations against the Israeli troops, besides launching Katyusha
rockets at northern Israeli territory.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reported to have told Netanyahu that Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad demands the restoration of the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau Israel seized from Syria in 1967, though he
(Assad) does not make it a precondition for the resumption of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria is ready to resume negotiations on the basis of the
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 which call for the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied territories, Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz has denied
having received any proposal or official communication from the
U.S. or any other diplomatic party about the "Lebanon first"
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Bouez added that if the "Lebanon first" means full and
comprehensive Israeli withdrawal behind the
internationally-recognized borders, in implementation of the
Security Council resolution 425, Lebanon will welcome that.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, if it means the commencement of political
negotiations for the conclusion of a Lebanese-Israeli peace treaty
first, Lebanon will flatly reject it.
</P>
<P>
He asserted Lebanon's solidarity with Syria, adding that
Lebanon would never accept any proposal that might disconnect the
Lebanese track of peace talks with Israel from the Syrian one.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid, who is currently visiting Lebanon, has
expressed the conviction that if the "Lebanon first" proposal aims
at driving a wedge between Lebanon and Syria, it will be doomed.

The above-mentioned facts show that Tibetan culture has been

<HEADLINE> School Lunch Handling Probed as Cause of Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese investigators probing a
nationwide food poisoning epidemic have found hygiene lapses in
the distribution of school food in the western city of Sakai,
which has borne the brunt of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Seven people have already died and more than 8,300 people have
been taken ill over the last two months in the worst outbreak of
food poisoning in the country since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has been caused by the 0-157 strain of the E. coli
bacteria. The bacteria grows rapidly at around body temperature --
about 37 degree Celsius. Growth can be explosive if foodstuffs are
tainted with it.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said supplies of school lunches were distributed
in unrefrigerated trucks and left at room temperature for up to
three hours at schools in Sakai, where over 6,400 people, mostly
school pupils, fell ill from contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
In Sakai, truck distribution of school lunch food usually
begins at 5:30 a.m. and it takes about two hours to distribute the
supplies to schools.
</P>
<P>
A lunch server at one school in the city said food supplies are
often left out in the school kitchen, not in a refrigerator, until
8:00 a.m. when cooks arrive at the school.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures rose as high as 30 degrees Celsius in Sakai, Osaka
Prefecture, even in the early morning hours in early July when
food poisoning was first reported.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Asked to Dismiss Suit Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government asked the
supreme court today to dismiss a suit against the legality of
creating the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
The government said the suitor has no legal standing to sue
because he lacks the required personal and substantial interest in
the subject and that the case is not ripe for judicial review
since no final agreement has yet been executed.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Ramon Gonzales filed the petition before the supreme
court questioning the authority of the president to create the
SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
In a 36-page comment on the petition, Chief Presidential Legal
Counsel Rene Cayetano likewise asked the high court to sustain the
legal and constitutional right of the president to create the
body.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the court will uphold the authority of
the president to create the SPCPD and dismiss the petition for
lack of merit," Cayetano said.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, President Fidel Ramos scored the critics of
the proposed SPCPD, saying they lack "openness, sharing and
caring."
</P>
<P>
He said Mindanao has the lowest levels of human development in
the country because of the almost three decades of conflict, and
with peace finally dawning there, economic growth and prosperity
of the people there will be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
He said those opposed to the SPCPD and the creation of a
special zone of peace and development in Mindanao are hampering
the growth and progress of the communities there.

LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The 19th summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) opens today in Abuja,
Nigeria and at lease nine heads of state and government of ECOWAS
arrived for the meeting late last night.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Daily Times newspaper, the leaders now in

Compaore of Burkina Faso, Lt. Dira Jairo of Gambia, Alfred Kuaro
of Mali, and Canasigbe Eyadema of Togo.

again by the Liberian crisis although it should normally be an
economic summit.

distrust for one another is such that hostilities could break out
at any movement will again recite a litany of woes to ECOWAS
leaders attending the Abuja summit but go back home to lead more
people to their early graves.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the faction leaders have steady supply
of arms and ammunition to fight on for more years, and some
warlords are known to be reluctant in relinquishing control of the
countryside rich in natural resources because they still earn
huge foreign exchange from export of the resources.
</P>
<P>
This led to the Sierra Leonean President Kabbah who suggest
last week that the faction leaders should be prosecuted over
alleged war crimes.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that ECOWAS leaders at the Abuja summit must not
only condemn the attitude of the warlords, they must also
demonstrate political will to apply sanctions on the recalcitrant
leaders.
</P>
<P>
That may be the only way to end the bloodbath and allow ECOWAS
return to the initial issues that informed its creation.

PARIS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The army imposes a new president on Burundi to save the
country from chaos. The confrontation between Hutus and Tutsis
risks another genocide similar to that in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. investigators of the Boeing 747 explosion last week say
that the tape recording of conversations in one of the black boxes
ended abruptly with an inexplainable sound that lasted for a
fraction of a second.
</P>

Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- One year after a terrorist bomb attack on a Paris
underground train in the heart of Paris on July 25, 1995, in which
eight people were killed and 92 injured, relatives and friends of
the victims, Parsians, tourists and government officials went to
the Saint-Michel Fountain in central Paris to lay flowers and pay
homage to the dead.
</P>
<P>
-- By imposing tougher sanctions against Iran and Libya,
Washingtong risks a trade war with Europe. President Bill Clinton

those European companies which have business ties with Tripoli and
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
-- General Alexander Lebed de-dramatizes NATO expansion by
saying that Russia has no more appetite for war. In an interview

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Receive Aid From EU, W. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
agreed to provide 240.5 million EUC (Nearly 300 million US
Dollars) for Tanzania's development projects this year.
</P>
<P>
A local weekly, the Business Times today quoted Karl Harbo,
head of the European delegation in Tanzania as saying Tanzania
would receive 30 percent more from the European Economic Union
under the second protocol of the Lome IV convention than it did
in the first convention agreed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the amount allocated to Tanzania under the
second Lome Convention IV protocol covering 1995-2000 was 240.5
million EUC, up from 185 million EUC in the first protocol which
covered 1990-1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a gesture of confidence in the current
Government of Tanzania, the World Bank is also to release for
Tanzania's use some 100 million U.S. Dollars blocked in 1994,
because of the tax revenue problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Resident Representative in the country R. P.
Brigish said here on Thursday that the amount would be given to
Tanzania for its balance of payment and would be provided through
the bank's Structural Adjustment Credit Program.
</P>
<P>
Brigish said the government of President Benjamin Mkapa had
provided hopes for major improvements in economic management.
</P>
<P>
"An improved macro-economic framework is reason enough for us
to resume balance of payment support," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official outlined the improvements as increase
in tax revenue, prudent expenditure control measures through pay
package reforms, and parastatal reforms. The latter has led to a
cut down in subsidies to parastatals.
</P>
<P>
He also described as positive the outcome of Consultative
Group talks in Paris, France last week. A total of 1.2 billion
U.S. Dollars was committed by the country's creditors. The amount
is on the basis of multilateral and bilateral agreements to be
concluded in the 1996/97 financial year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Close Bogus Learning Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to close all bogus private learning institutions which are
rendering mediocre service but charging exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
Shamitiba Kanyanga, Dean of the School of Natural Sciences of
University of Zambia, told President Frederick Chiluba here on
Thursday that the mushrooming learning centers lack necessary
facilities and capacity to conduct training and that in most
cases employed unqualified staff members.
</P>
<P>
Today's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper quoted him as saying that
liberalization in the education sector should be closely
monitored to guard against abuse.
</P>
<P>
At a fair of junior engineers, technicians and scientists
organization he called on the government to tighten its
regulations on the formation of colleges.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba said the country needs to formulate local
technology to reduce its dependence on developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to emphasize the need for education and
research in science and technology, otherwise we shall be caught
in this so called technological colonialism where we will alwaysnn
be dependent," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader appealed to Zambian industrialists to
actively support upcoming scientists for the development of their
country.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Gives All-Clear on Mad Sheep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has given the all-clear
signal to Cypriot sheep following Britain's latest "mad sheep"
scare.
</P>
<P>
Britain Thursday banned the sale of sheep and goat heads after
a suspected link between Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-
mad cow disease - and sheep's brains.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Cyprus Mail reported today that if the link is
established, it means the disease, which is suspected of
manifesting itself in humans as Creutzfeldtjakob Disease, has come
full circle.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it is widely believed that BSE resulted from
feeding cows on offal from sheep infected with scrapie, a disease
long existing in sheep but with no apparent transmission factor to
humans.
</P>
<P>
Now it appears sheep can contract BSE through being fed on
infected cow's offal, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Director of Cyprus' Veterinary Department Pavlos Economides
was quoted today as saying that Cypriots, for whom sheep's brains
are a traditional delicacy, need not worry.
</P>
<P>
He said sheep in Cyprus are not fed upon animal offal. "There
has been a legal order in force for years preventing this," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The official also said there are no imports of sheep's heads
into Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Since the BSE scare started earlier this year, the sale of
beef in Cyprus has dropped sharply despite the fact that no case
of BSE was ever reported on the island. There has been a
corresponding rise in the sale of mutton.

BEIRUT -- The Middle East Airlines (MEA), Lebanon's state-owned
company, will obtain 225 million U.S. dollars to update its fleet
and to pay defaulted salaries of employees, the local daily Beirut
Diyar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the company's Administrative Council Khalid Salam
announced that the company would sell four Boeing 707s and rent
four other passenger planes as measures to update its fleet which

who have not received full payment for six months.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources
will set up a project aimed at turning nine floating irrigation
stations into stable irrigation stations.
</P>
<P>

help improve the irrigation conditions in the Aswan governorate.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Italy will jointly sponsor a thermal power
station in Assiut in upper Egypt.
</P>

<HEADLINE> DPRK Rebukes Japan's Slanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea today rebuked Japan for its slanders against the DPRK
made in the 1996 While Paper on Defense.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a strong-worded
commentary that slandering and harming others in a far-fetched way
is the old practice and method of the Japanese aggressive forces.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, which was adopted by the Japanese cabinet on
July 19, described the DPRK as "a serious factor of instability in
ensuring security in the whole of East Asia."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said, "the factor of instability in East Asia is
none other than Japan and this has been well illustrated by the
new white paper of defense."
</P>
<P>
The white paper "cries for" the need to expand the activities
of the Japanese Self-Defense forces to operations of searching and
rescuing refugees and transporting Japanese abroad in emergency.
</P>
<P>
"This implies that the Japanese troops can engage in military
operations in any region of the world at any time under any
pretext," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
By calling the DPRK a factor of instability, Japan is trying to
mould world opinion that the DPRK is "a very dangerous country,"
and watching for a chance to reinvade Korea, it added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said Japan should not take issue with others
while trying to convert itself into a military power and a nuclear
power.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Burundi President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya, who was on Thursday toppled by a Tutsi military
coup led by retired major Pierre Buyoya, said he would not
resign.
</P>
<P>
"Taking account of my responsibilities, there's no question of
my resignation. I cannot send this country tumbling into the
unknown," said the Hutu president on Thursday, quoted by reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ntibantunganya, who has been taking refugee in the
United States Embassy in Bujumbura since Tuesday, said his stay
with the U.S. ambassador was a temporary "visit to a friend".
</P>
<P>
Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army had seized power, disbanded
parliament, closed border and airport, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn
curfew in the central Africa state on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The army cited the government's failure to pacify the exploded
situation in Burundi which is at the verge of an all-out ethnic
war between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen earlier lobbed grenades into the main
market of capital Bujumbura and aid workers feared Burundi would
suffer the same genocide as neighboring Rwanda where up to a
million people died in 1994. Both countries have a Tutsi minority
and a Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's military take-over was immediately condemned by the
United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the United
States, South Africa, Kenya and other African countries.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Burundi's Defense Minister Primin
Sinzoyiheba said he would make an important statement to the
nation today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Engineers Combat Petro-Plant Lightning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese engineers have worked out
a new way of preventing giant oil storage tanks from being struck
by lightning.
</P>
<P>
The method, developed by the Beijing Yinhe New Technology
Company and the Sichuan Zhongguang High-tech Company, breaks down
the electrical power of lightning with multi protective layers.
</P>
<P>
Anti-lightning has been a knotty problem worldwide for
engineers looking for ways to protect equipment and other
inflammable equipment in petro-chemical installations
</P>
<P>
Fires and explosions in and around inflammable oil storage
tanks cost heavy losses in China each year. Some of the tanks
cover an area of a kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have also evolved new ways of protecting
domestic electric appliances from being damaged by lightning.
</P>
<P>
Commonly-used lightning rods can generate strong magnetic
fields, even when they are conducting lightning into the earth,
and the magnetic fields can be greatly harmful to telephones,
computers and other domestic electric appliances.

<HEADLINE> Burundi's Military Strongman Pierre Buyoya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Major Pierre Buyoya, Burundi's
new military head of state, is a European-trained soldier who led
the country from 1987 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old leader of the former military government was
on Thursday installed again by his fellow Tutsis as Burundi's
head of state in a coup that ousted President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the Tutsi army fighting a bush war against Hutu
rebels who are gaining ground, Buyoya is considered a moderate in
Burundi's extremist ethnic politics where around 1,000 people are
dying every month in the small central African country.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya was also the man who ushered in democracy for the first
time in the former German colony and Belgian protectorate.
</P>
<P>
The military strongman arranged free elections in June 1993
which led to the crushing victory of Melchior Ndadaye of the
Frodebu Party representing the Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
But only four months later, sections of the Tutsi could no
longer stand a Hutu leader in a land always ruled by the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
In October 1993, President Ndadaye and many prominent Hutu
leaders were assassinated by the Tutsi and at least 50,000
Burundians were slaughtered in the weeks that followed in
reprisal massacres all over the central African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China has drawn up detailed plans
to speed up economic development in the country's western parts,
an official from the State Planning Commission revealed today.
</P>
<P>
When the plan is fully implemented, it will narrow the gap
between economically developed coastal eastern China, and the
underdeveloped western part, said Jin Ping, head of the strategic
development division under the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The development strategy comprises construction of railways,
highways, telecommunication facilities, infrastructure and the
establishment of new agricultural and industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Key projects planned for the forthcoming five years include
construction of a railway line linking Nanning, capital of Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province,
and a 1,000-km-long double-track railway line between Guiyang,
capital of Guizhou Province, and Zhuzhou, a city in southern Hunan
Province, and upgrading of a railway section between Guiyang and
Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 1,000-km-long railway line connecting Xi'an,
capital of Shaanxi Province, with Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu
Province, will be built to cope with growing freight transport.
</P>
<P>
A high-grade highway between Lianyungang, a port city in
Jiangsu, and Xinjiang' Horgos is expected to be operational by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Other key projects listed in the Five-Year Plan are renovation
of existing Sichuan-Tibet highway, and airports at Urumqi,
Nanning, Guilin, Yinchuan and Guiyang.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Scales down Investment in Capital Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong province has
slowed down the pace of investment in capital construction to save
more funds for technical renovation work.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that local state-owned enterprises and state
stock-holding bodies made a total investment of 15.49 billion yuan
(about 1.86 billion US dollars) in the first five months of 1996,
up 15.6 percent from the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, 7.86 billion yuan (about 0.95 billion US
dollars) was for capital construction, up 10.9 percent from the
same period of last year. But growth rate dropped by 12.7 percent
compared to the corresponding period of previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the investment in technical renovations stood at 3.87
billion yuan, up 38.8 percent, with the growth rate 14.3 percent
higher than the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Experts commented that capital construction only increased the
quantity of fixed assets, whereas technical renovation improved
the quality of the assets.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Parties for Inter-party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretaries of Zambian opposition
parties are preparing inter-party talks to look for a solution to
the present stalemate in the country's political arena.
</P>
<P>
The opposition secretaries, who met on Thursday and made the
appeal to the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD),
will meet on next Monday again to lay the ground for the
inter-party talks, the local daily ''the Post'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Democratic Congress Deputy General Secretary Azwell
Banda in an interview with the local press on Thursday night said
that all secretaries present in Thursday's meeting unanimously
agree to meet on Monday.
</P>
<P>
''We are inviting the MMD Secretary, Michael Sata, to this
meeting so that we can prepare the ground work for the
inter-party talks,'' said Banda, ''The sooner we resolve the
issue of the constitution and electoral process, the better
because time is running out.''
</P>
<P>
Banda insisted that the talks should be held before the end of
the verification of the voters register for the forthcoming
general elections scheduled later this year.
</P>
<P>
A political strife has taken place in Zambia over a
controvercial constitution amendment bill signed by President
Frederick Chiluba at the end of May. This resulted in the
suspension of the inter-party talks in search of political
consensus in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, only second indigenous
generation Zambians are qualified for the country's presidency.
This actually bars K. Kaunda, former state president and leader
of the opposition United National Independence Party, from
contenting for the post as his parents were immigrants from
neighboring Malawi before the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party maintains that the constitution amendment is
a law and every one should abide by it as it was adopted in
parliament and signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, however, argue that it is unjust and
they promise to try to repeal it.

<P>
Provinces in western China have been greatly inspired by
increased government allocations to them, and the approval of
a plan to accelerate exploitation of oil resources at Tarim,
Junggar and Turpan basins, said Hu Angang, a noted Chinese
economist, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Western China commands 90 percent of rare earth, sylvite and
magnesium reserves in China. It is rich in oil and natural gas
resources which will turn the region into an energy powerhouse of
the future.
</P>
<P>
The state plans to build a heavy calcium plant with an annual
output of 400,000 tons in Yunnan, and another calcium plant with a
capacity of 800,000 tons in Guizhou, a nitrogenous fertilizer
plant which uses natural gas as a raw material in Xinjiang, and a
potash fertilizer plant with a designed annual production capacity
of 800,000 tons in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Projects to be built in the western part will enjoy priority in
obtaining government approval and the use of funds, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
Western China's slice of the 13 trillion yuan total state
investment in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) will be
increased by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
East-West cooperation will be an important factor for
the economic take-off of western China, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, China's largest industrial center of
Shanghai and some large cities in Guangdong will build textile
mills, with 500,000 spindles at cotton producing areas in the
wester region. New sugar refineries will be set up in Guangxi,
Yunnan and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
A number of coastal cities have already forged economic and
trade ties with provinces in the western region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government pledges that the gap between the eastern
 and western China will not be enlarged in the next five years and
will be gradually narrowed in the next century.

CANBERRA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The first round of
Australian-U.S. ministerial talks (AUSMIN) were held in Sydney
today, with high-ranking officials from both countries hailing the
reinvigoration of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard met the U.S. delegation
comprising Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense
Secretary William Perry and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
John Shalikashvili at the HMAS Watson naval facility on Sydney's
South Head this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian sources, this was the highest-powered
U.S. official delegation to the country in decades.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that ANZUS -- a defense treaty signed among
Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. but crippled by New Zealand's
withdrawal -- remained the cornerstone of the relations between
Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that the government's commitment to
reinvigorating the alliance with the U.S. did not mean downgrading
links with Asia.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meeting between Australian and U.S. officials
came after Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer attended
the recent ministerial meetings of the Association of Southeast
Asia Nations (ASEAN) in Jakarta, Indonesia.

JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli couple were killed
and their son critically wounded this morning in a drive-by
shooting near Beit Shemesh near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Suspected gunmen fired Kalashnikov rifles this morning at the
car in which the couple, their son and daughter-in-law were
traveling. The daughter-in-law escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
A large number of policemen arrived at the scene after the
attack, setting up roadblocks to search for the murderers.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the attack. But
Jerusalem Police Commander Arye Amit said he believed the attack
might be linked to a gang of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine (PFLP) which had launched several similar attacks in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Today's incident was the third drive-by shooting since Israel's
May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, another couple were killed in a similar attack on a
road near Beit Shemesh. Their seven-month old son was luckily
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
On June 16, gunmen shot at a car in a West Bank town, killing
the father, an Israeli policeman, and wounding the mother.
</P>
<P>
After the June attacks, residents in the area complained about
the slow reaction of the police. And then Internal Security
Minister Moshe Shahal admitted that police did not have enough
manpower in areas along the Green line, where people were more
prone to "terrorist attacks."
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been expecting a new wave of
anti-Israel attacks after the May 29 election victory of the
hardline Likud party, which vowed to take a tougher line toward
the Middle East peace process.

TOKYO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military in Japan have
imposed a nighttime curfew on sailors from the U.S. Naval base in
Japan's southwestern port city of Sasebo.
</P>
<P>
The measure, according to a Kyodo News Service report today,
was adopted in the wake of the arrest of a U.S. sailor last week
on charges of robbery and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
Military police since have also stepped up patrols in Sasebo,
Nagasaki Prefecture, informed sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The curfew, from 12:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. local time, was
announced on base broadcasts Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
It applies to all sailors from Sasebo, except for the
commanding ranks, and sailors aboard U.S. navy vessels visiting
other ports in Kyushu, or Japan's southwestern region.

<HEADLINE> Ningbo to Expand Cooperation with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Xu Yunhong, a city leader in the
port of Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang Province, has pledged to
increase the city's cooperation with Hong Kong in various areas,
particularly in harbor construction.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who is secretary of the Ningbo City Communist Party
Committee, says: "Ningbo plans to build itself into a modern
international port city. So, we need to draw on Hong Kong's
experience in trade, shipping, finance, telecommunications and
tourism."
</P>
<P>
He noted that economic cooperation between the two port cities
is currently in the form of capital, labor and land, and adds: "I
think the two cities should cooperate with each other in
technology, management and information in the future."
</P>
<P>
He asked Hong Kong entrepreneurs to assist Ningbo in
improving its manufacturing sector and to invest in finance and
the information industries, and said that the two cities have
bright prospects for port construction and cooperation in marine
shipping.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, the city's Beilun Port is one of the best
deep-water ports in China and its first berth for 300,000-dwt
ships. Beilun also has wharves for the latest container ships.
</P>
<P>
He said that he thinks the construction of the Shanghai
international shipping center will spur the economy of the Yangtze
River Delta and turn the valley into the locomotive driving
China's economic growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will be connected with the Shanghai international
shipping center via Ningbo Port and gain from the rapid economic
growth in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the most developed areas
in China.
</P>
<P>
To increase cooperation with Hong Kong, Ningbo must improve its
investment environment and services for Hong Kong companies, he
said: "We should draw on Hong Kong's managerial expertise and look
for and train personnel who are vital to the construction of a
modern port city."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong will be asked to
help train senior managerial personnel for Ningbo, he pointed out,
adding that Hong Kong advisers will be invited to work in Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts will be made to draw up plans for the
development of various industries and development zones in Ningbo,
and that the plan's targets should be announced to the economic
community in Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong investors will be able
to do better feasibility studies and increase the return on their
investment.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that a coordination department be set up by
government departments in Ningbo and the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council to help solve problems that will crop up.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Better Life For Tibet's Rural Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Farmers and herdsmen in Tibet have
improved their standard of living over the past five years as a
result of steady growth of agricultural production and livestock
breeding.
</P>
<P>
Per capita net income of Tibet's rural residents has risen at
an average annual rate of 8.6 percent since 1991, an official of
the Tibet Autonomous Regional Department of Agriculture said,
explaining that rural residents earned 878 yuan each on average in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, 80 percent of farmers and herdsmen
have built new house, increasing per capita floor space to 21
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production and livestock breeding were valued at
2.31 billion yuan in 1995, up 18 percent from 1990, the official
said, attributing the achievements to government efforts to
improve farming conditions.
</P>
<P>
Among these have been financing the construction of 114 small
hydroelectric power projects with a combined generating capacity
of 20,000 kilowatts over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have also improved nearly 6,000 hectares of low-yield
farmland and planted trees on 16,700 hectares of land.

<P>
Seventy-five centers for spreading the use of advanced farming
techniques have been set up in Tibet since 1991, the official

technical training courses and fine strains of crop seeds have
been sown on nearly 16,700 hectares in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Strongman Defends Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's new leader, Major
Pierre Buyoya, today defended the military coup he staged on
Thursday, saying his goal is to halt the tide of ethnic violence
sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation today through the state radio,
monitored here, the military government also rejected any forms
of foreign intervention, saying that Burundi, as an independent
country, has the right to manage its own internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Our first objective is to immediately stop the massacres and
all forms of criminality that have prevailed in Burundi for the
last three years," said Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
"Burundi is an independent country. We reject any form of
foreign interference and will not be colonialized again," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leader of the minority Tutsi-dominated army
held out an olive branch to ousted Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya, promising national reconciliation and a return to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The army has no plans to ask for the president to be given up
by the American ambassador and as far as we know he has no plans
to leave the country in the foreseeable future," said Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is calm and the country is under the direction
it needs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya, who has been taking refuge in the United
States Embassy in Bujumbura, refused to resign. The White House
today issued another statement to condemn the military coup and
reaffirmed its support to the Hutu president.
</P>
<P>
The military coup in the central African country was
immediately met with international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
U. N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Organization of
African Unity Chief Salim Ahmed Salim and South African President
Nelson Mandela, together with other African leaders, have stated
against the military coup and called for an early path to
democratic rule in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
African diplomats say Africa's senior statesman, former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere who has been mediating the
Burundi crisis, would push for an international campaign to
isolate Buyoya's government and bring it to its knees.
</P>
<P>
They say Africa's common stance in the Burundi situation would
be spelled out at Nyerere's Africa Emergency Summit scheduled for
early next week in Tanzania's capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army, led by Major Buyoya, seized
power on Thursday, disbanded parliament, closed border and
airport, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
The army cited the government's failure to pacify the exploded
situation in Burundi which is at the verge of an all-out ethnic
war between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Buyoya, who had been the country's military
leader between 1987 and 1993, is considered a moderate Tutsi in
the extreme world of Burundi's ethnic politics.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 150,000 people have been killed during three years
of ethnic violence in Burundi. World leaders have pleaded not to
allow a repeat of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda but so
far no effective actions have been taken.

<HEADLINE> Arafat on Significance of His Meeting with Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat has described his meeting with Syrian President
Hafez Assad Thursday evening in Syria's Mediterranean port city of
Latakia as "important, useful, positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted Arafat as saying in a statement to
the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) that his meeting with President
Assad had dealt with all issues of importance to the Arab nation,
including the changes and challenges facing the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
It also covered the present status of the peace process in the
wake of the changes in Israel caused by hard-line Likud party
leader Benjamin Netanyahu's May 29 election victory, and the
importance of coordination so that the process could actually be
comprehensive, continuous and just.
</P>
<P>
Arafat went on to say, "We have listened to President Assad's
advices and views which are good, important and constructive. He
(Assad) has presented his complete version about what we are
facing in the West Bank and Gaza and the attempts (of Israel) to
delay what has already been agreed upon and duly signed."
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed appreciation of Syria's strong and important
stances in favor of the Palestinians during the current difficult
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on the coordination of our efforts and on
moving along the Arab, Islamic and international levels for the
protection of Jerusalem against the impending dangers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Assad and Arafat discussed during their meeting
inter-Arab relations, the situation in the region in the light of
the recent Cairo Arab summit, the new developments, the current
efforts to implement the Arab summit resolutions, and the
prospects of guiding the peace process to its cherished target of
just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the issue of Jerusalem and the situation in
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Syria Thursday on his visit to the country
since the signing of the Oslo agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The visit is seen here as a thaw in relations between the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Their relations deteriorated when the Palestinians signed the
peace accord with Israel in 1993. Syria complained about the lack
of coordination when the Palestinians decided to ink the accord.

<HEADLINE> Balidogle Airport Falls to Ali Mahdi: Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The most important airport of
Balidogle and the nearby district of Wanlewein were taken over by
the "peace forces" of Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto
late Thursday, a communique claimed today.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique issued by USC/SSA supporting Ali Mahdi,
USC/SNA supporting Osman Atto and USC/PM of Hawadle clan here
claimed that the airport of Balidogle, 90 kms west of the
capital, was closed after the militiamen of General Mohamed Farah
Aidid were chased out of the area.
</P>
<P>
The statement declared that the forces of peace will reopen
the airport for air traffic once the whole area is secured, while
the heavily fortified area will remain open for the civilian
movement.
</P>
<P>
It said the peace forces will not negotiate with Aidid until
he retreats from his proclamation of being President of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the area said General Aidid had kept only three
armed wagons and less than 80 militiamen when more than 13
technicals and 400 men overran his men.
</P>
<P>
At least eight deaths and more than 19 wounded were reported
during the clashes at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in the area said these forces came from three
different directions and the fighting which ensued took less than
90 minutes before the whole area fell silent.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting is currently continuing between rival
militiamen at Tihsile village, 30 kms east of Balidogle where the
militiamen of General Aidid are pushing their way through.
</P>
<P>
Aidid has sent heavy technicals and a large number of
militiamen in a bid to regain the control of the airport.
</P>
<P>
The weakness of General Aidid is believed to have brought
about by the concentration of his militia on Mogadishu's green
line, Bosnia, Huriwa and the most serious sector of Medina in
south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
He also has militiamen in other front lines with General
Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan of Kismayo, Gedo, Bay, Bakol and
Galkaio regions.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Balidogle airport will be a major militia and
economical setback for General Aidid if the airport continues in
the hands of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu supporting Ali Mahdi also spoke about
the victory by reading out the communique jointly released by
their forces.
</P>
<P>
There's no word yet from the government of General Aidid over
the fighting in Mogadishu or the change of control at Balidogle.
however, sources from the commercial airlines companies confirmed
the fall of the airport.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Tourism Industry Declines since April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's booming tourism
industry is showing a downward trend after a series of suicide
bombings against Israelis earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend began in April and has reportedly become
more serious, according to figures provided by Israel's Hotel
Association and the Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
In January and February, Israel witnessed an increase of 27
percent in terms of bed-nights by foreign tourists, and a 14
percent jump in occupancy rates.
</P>
<P>
However, there were only 9 percent bed-nights by tourists in
March after the wave of suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Tourist accommodation saw a 14 percent drop in June, compared
with the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The most seriously hit was Jerusalem, where the Hotel
Association reported a drop of 18 percent in the number of foreign
tourists during June, as well as 3 percent fewer Israeli
bed-nights. The occupancy rate in Jerusalem during June was 61
percent, compared with 74 percent in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration figures showed that the
number of incoming and outgoing passengers in June dropped 4.5
percent from 555,000 to 529,000 compared with the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit were El AL, the Israeli national carrier, and
its charter subsidiary Sun Dor, which suffered a combined drop in
passengers of 13 percent and a drop in market share from 45.7
percent to 41.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, El Al spokesman Nachman Kleiman
said the company's poor showing for June reflected both a drop in
visits by foreign tourists and a decrease in the number of
Israelis going abroad.
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis canceled reservations as vacation time approached
as a result of the present economic situation, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region has set a target of hitting a yearly business turnover of
121 million yuan by 2000 in posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The region has earmarked efforts to promote the development of
posts and communications to meet its target.
</P>
<P>
It means that the sector will have to maintain an annual growth
rate of 20 percent in the remaining years of the century.
</P>
<P>
A local government official said that Tibet will strive to
build an efficient postal network during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
He said Tibet will also strengthen administration over its 150
post offices, and bring about 27 million yuan in business volume
from postal services by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
On telecommunications, the official said that the region will
step up the development of program-controlled telephone networks.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Claims 19 Lives in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The death toll has risen to 19 from
the devastation caused by tropical storm Frankie as it swept
across northern Vietnam on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Nine others were reported missing and nearly 100 people injured.
</P>
<P>
Official report published here today said property losses would
amount to about 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the six seriously affected provinces, the three coastal one
of Thai Binh, Nam Ha and Ninh Binh were the most devastated.
</P>
<P>
Although local authorities had acted on early warnings of the
impending storm and mobilized both human and material resources,
fierce wind velocities measuring around 100 kilometers per hour
caught everyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Fishing trawlers and ocean going vessels were warned against
going to sea, and advised to find safe mooring.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, more than 200 trawlers moored along Thai Binh's
coast capsized while about 40 other boats and wooden cruise boats
in Haiphong were broken to pieces.
</P>
<P>
Big waves overwhelmed sea dyke systems in Thai Binh, Nam Ha and
Thanh Hoa, causing heavy damage to about 4,000 meters of sea dyke.
</P>
<P>
Almost all overhead power supply grids in the these provinces
were partially destroyed.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 pylons of high-voltage and low-voltage grid
were broken in Nam ha, Thai Binh, Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa alone.
And prolonged blackouts rendered pumping machines useless in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with broken sea dykes, the inundation resulted in more
than 200,000 hectares of rice being submerged.
</P>
<P>
Almost all flimsily built houses along the 400-kilometer-long
coastline from Quang Ninh to Thanh Hoa were destroyed, leaving
tens of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Most schools were damaged and village infirmaries were in bad
shape, according to provincial reports.
</P>
<P>
Communication and traffic in many coastal districts was
paralyzed until yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and cabinet members were dispatched to the
affected areas thursday to help local authorities in restoring
life to normal.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Production Up in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
production increased by 10 percent in May this year, thanks mainly
to the growth in the paints and pharmaceutical and machinery
industries, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the EDB noted that despite the overall increase,
output levels of the transport equipment, electrical machinery,
plastic products and industrial chemicals industries were lower
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
With the May increase, cumulative output for the first five
months of this year increased by 12.8 percent compared to the same
period of last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
In May, production of the paints and pharmaceutical industry
shot up by 27.1 percent, as a result of strong growth in the
pharmaceuticals segment with output stimulated by overseas demand
for pharmaceutical intermediates.
</P>
<P>
The machinery industry grew by 25 percent in May, with output
in all the major segments increasing especially in the
construction of oil rig, oilfield equipment, refrigerating
equipment, lifts, escalators, dies and tools. For the first five
months, the cumulative output increased by 21.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the electronics industry recorded a 16.3
percent growth. Among the subsegments, disk drive and computer
peripherals, such as printers, recorded significant growth.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative output of the electronics sector as a whole
increased by 20.7 percent in the first five months compared to
last year, the EDB said. But it warned that the outlook for the
electronics sector remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the output of the industrial chemicals
industry declined by 0.3 percent as production of petrochemicals
was affected by some maintenance shutdown.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the output of transport equipment dropped by 7.3
percent year-on-year, the production of the electrical machinery
industry fell by 5.4 percent, and the plastic products industry
declined by 4.1 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Australia, U.S. to Hold Joint Exercises Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the United States
will hold a series of the largest military exercises since the end
of World War II in Australia from early next year.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement finalized at the first annual
Australian-U.S. ministerial meeting, known as AUSMIN, 17,000 U.S.
servicemen and 5,000 Australian soldiers will be involved in a
joint military exercise at the Shoalwater Bay training center in
Queensland in late February and early March next year.
</P>
<P>
The Exercise Tandem Thrust 97 is part of the agreement reached
between Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan, and U.S. State Secretary Warren
Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will upgrade their
defense cooperation by holding regular joint military exercises
and establishing a new satellite early warning system relay
station at Pine Gap in central Australia to replace the Nurrungur
base in South Australia by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to step up U.S. marine exercises
on Australia's land. They plan to have as many as seven U.S.
marine exercises in northern Australia every year. Each exercise
will involve 2,500 U.S. marines instead of the present
company-sized training.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the U.S.-Australian alliance had never been
stronger.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia was of strategic significance for the
United States because of its geographical location.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to that, it is one of the three countries with
which we have major security alliances that provide the security
stability in the western Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard told the U.S. delegation
this morning that the ANZUS (Australia-New Zealand-U.S.) alliance
was the cornerstone of the Australian-U.S. relationship, despite
the end of the Cold War, because such alliances were important in
times of strategic change.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that closer security relations with the U.S. would
boost Australia's credentials in Asia by contributing to regional
security.
</P>
<P>
"We can made a contribution along with various other countries
to encouraging the United States to remain actively engaged in
security for the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first round of AUSMIN talks concentrated on issues of
regional security.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been explicitly committed to maintaining a
100,000-strong military presence in the Asia Pacific region. But
it has lost the ground for large-scale military exercises in the
region since it withdrew from bases in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Shantou Eyes A Revival in Citrus Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tough competition and rising costs
have dealt a bitter blow in Shantou to the famous Chaozhou Citrus.
</P>
<P>
Output of citrus fruit in the south China city has plummeted,
sounding an alarm to the city government. The growing acreage has
shrunk in just five years from 8,140 hectares to 660 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The Citrus growers in the special economic zone faced fierce
competition from domestic and foreign fruit growers, either
exported or smuggled.
</P>
<P>
Price hikes of fertilizers and pesticides were also blamed for
pushing up the production costs and eating into profits
considerably.
</P>
<P>
Changing tastes of consumers also forced citrus growers to cut
down production of unpopular citrus varieties.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the slide in citrus production, the local
government is set to support the industry with a stronger capital
input, introducing finer strains of the fruit, strengthening
scientific research of citrus growing techniques, and promoting
marketing of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
As a renowned speciality in south China's Chaozhou and Shantou
cities, the citrus should be developed and grown on large
acreages, suggested some experts of the Wuhan Botanical Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Guangdong Provincial
Agricultural Sciences Academy.

</P>
<P>
In April, a 66-member medical team went to Jinzhai County, a
revolutionary base during the 1930s and 1940s in east China's
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
They offered one-month courses to provide additional training
to 720 teachers and 50 medical workers. More than 3,000 children
and women received physical check-ups at that time.
</P>
<P>
Later, more medical groups were sent to poverty-stricken
regions, including southwest China's Guizhou, the Tibet Autonomous
Region, and the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
By mid-August, approximately 800 teachers and medical personnel
are expected to receive advanced training, 2,300 women and
children will undergo physical examinations, and a summer camp
will be held for 1,600 local schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
The China Welfare Institute plans to open a model kindergarten
in the area.
</P>
<P>
"More services will be given to women and children in the
relatively poor areas, mountainous regions and former
revolutionary bases in the next few years," said Ai Boying, an
official with the institute.

<HEADLINE> New Service Centers in Shanghai Help Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest industrial
city in China, is probing a new way of relocating laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Textile Share-holding Group Company, and the
Shanghai Instrument and Electronics Share-holding Group Company,
today took the lead in establishing reemployment service centers.
</P>
<P>
The centers are aimed at taking care of laid-off workers by
giving them training and helping them find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The textile and instrument and electronic industries have laid
off the biggest numbers workers, compared to other industries, and
their ex-workers find it the hardest to get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers will be taken care of at the reemployment
service centers, so that they do not have to roam aimlessly in
society. At the centers they will receive professional training to
pave the way for future work opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It enables their original enterprises to be able to forge ahead
with fewer burdens, allowing them to concentrate on industrial
restructuring and shift operational mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts pointed out that the establishment of
reemployment service centers will help heavy loss-making
enterprises to go into bankruptcy, so that more competitive
ventures will have a better growth.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years 860,000 workers in Shanghai have been
laid off, with 660,000 having found new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Adopts New Law on Wild Animal Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- People in a southwest China
province who have jumbo-sized confrontations with an elephant, or
escape from the jaws of a hungry tiger, will be able to claim
compensation for their ordeals.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Provincial People's Congress has passed a new law on the
protection of rare wild animals, such as Asian elephants,
Indo-China tigers, white-cheek gibbons and mouse deer in its
Xishuangbanna prefecture.
</P>
<P>
And officials have finally recognized the growing success in
animal protection work in China.
</P>
<P>
As the once threatened beasts win a new freedom and grow in
number so has the number of incidents involving their human
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
So the new law includes a special compensation fund that allows
the payment of damages to people who suffer damage or injury
caused by the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The law also strengthens punishments on those who kill rare
wild animals, and it also spells out the responsibilities of the
special guards for wild animals, and local officials in charge of
the incidents in the area.
</P>
<P>
The wild animal protection fund to be established under the law
will be partly used to compensate local residents who are injured
or whose property is damaged by wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The fund will absorb government appropriated money and domestic
and overseas donations.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province has various rare wild animals
on its doorstep, most of them belonging to tropical forest
families.
</P>
<P>
China issued its first wild animal protection law eight years
ago, and ever since rare wild animal protection in Xishuangbanna
has improved. The number of wild animals has been increasing in
the region.
</P>
<P>
However, many local residents face a growing number of
incidents in which they are injured by wild beasts, or suffer
damage to crops by wild animals.
</P>
<P>
People in Xishuangbanna suffer an annual property loss of over
one million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars). Until now they could only
obtain a very small amount of compensation.

<HEADLINE> Artemether Found Effective in Snail Fever Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A medicine used for treating
malaria has proved to be effective in the prevention of snail
fever, a parasitic disease that has an at-risk population of 600
million people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
An oral application of artemether given on a trial basis to
1,345 people in two areas endangered by snail fever found the rate
of infection dropped by 60 to 72 percent, and no cases if the
disease were reported.
</P>
<P>
Artemether was produced in the 1980s by the Kunming
Pharmaceutical Company to treat malaria.
</P>
<P>
People who suffer from schistosome, a disease caused by worms,
said their symptoms were alleviated after they took the capsule.
</P>
<P>
Artemether can kill immature schistosome worms in humans and
animals, according to medical experts from the Parasitic Disease
Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine Sciences and the Kunming Pharmaceutical Company, which
jointly developed the medicine.
</P>
<P>
Experiments on rabbits and dogs showed that almost all
schistosomes in the animal were wiped out after the animals were
fed artemether.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that 50 million people in China live in areas
that are prone to snail fever; the country currently has some 1.1
million snail fever patients.

<HEADLINE> India Introduces Poll Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government introduced
a much-awaited electoral reforms bill in the Lok Sabha (lower
house of parliament) on Thursday night, the Hindustan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes to curtail the poll campaign period from 21
days to 14 days and eliminate "non-serious candidates" by raising
the amount of security deposit by 10 times to 5,000 rupees (about
143 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, in respect of candidates belonging to the scheduled
castes and tribes, the deposit has been fixed at 2,500 rupees
(about 72 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The measure is intended to eliminate the proliferation of
non-serious candidates in the electoral arena, a phenomenon which
has posed a major problem for the Election Commission all these
years.
</P>
<P>
The new reform package also includes a statutory amendment for
delimitation of constituencies without affecting the number of
existing seats.
</P>
<P>
The two bills were introduced by Minister of State for Law
Ramakant d. Khalap in the Lok Sabha.

<P>
DHAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 22 people have lost their
lives so far as flood hit at least 37 districts in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, more than 5.17 million people of

<HEADLINE> Nepali Minister's Secret Bank Account Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat has secretly deposited foreign currency in an
American bank offending against the government's regulations,
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(UML) Thursday at a Lower House meeting revealed that Mahat
opened a personal account in the Worldwide Consumer Bank (WCB) of
New York in November 1995 after he was appointed finance minister
of the present coalition government, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
MP of the CPN-UML Krishna Gopal Shrestha also submitted a
photocopy of a bank statement of Mahat's account in the New York
bank to Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Everest Herald, an English-language daily believed to be close
to the opposition, today published the photocopy of the WCB bank's
statement showing that Mahat has more than 47,000 US dollars in
the account till late June.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's foreign exchange regulations act, a Nepali
national or organization has to take permission from Nepal Rastra
Bank, the country's central bank, before opening an account
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The act provides that any violation could lead the seizure of
the amount and three years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank has no record of Finance Minister
Mahat's personal account in any foreign bank, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry last April issued a notice demanding
depositors to present their statements of their foreign accounts
within three months, but the finance minister himself did not make
his statement or transfer his account to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
MP Shrestha at the Lower House meeting Thursday demanded the
finance minister to disclose his source of income and confess what
he did.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior officer from the central bank, violation
of the foreign exchange regulations act amounts to a criminal
offense.

<HEADLINE> Informal Senior Officials' Meeting of ASEM ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the decision of the first ASEM held in Bangkok in March,
this meeting, attended by top officials from 25 countries
including 15 of the European Union, seven of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan and South Korea,
highlighted issues on strengthening economic and trade cooperation
between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Participants also exchanged views on issues of the forthcoming
first ministerial meeting, which is to be held in Singapore in
December, of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
</P>
<P>
They believe that the ministerial meeting will play a
significant role in maintaining the bilateral trade system and
promoting increase of world economy and trade, so it is necessary
to intensify communication and coordination between Asian and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The officials also urged to accelerate the process of
negotiations on the entry to WTO of some economically important
countries.
</P>
<P>
Differences on the working focus of WTO's ministerial meetings
and its future working plan existed between officials from Asia
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Asian countries generally thought facilitating
the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements as the focal
points of the ministerial meetings. WTO should not discuss the
criteria of labor force and issues irrelevant to trade, they said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which fully discussed the issues of trade and
economic cooperation between Asia and Europe for the first time,
also agreed to start to make "convenient action plan on Euro-Asia
trade".
</P>
<P>
The consensus reached at the meeting will produce positive
influence on ASEM's initiation, especially on the determination of
ASEM's keynote of trade and economic cooperation and
implementation of the agreements reached by leaders of
participating countries of ASEM in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation and Vice Minister of the Foreign
Ministry Li Zhaoxing noted that economies of the two continents
are strongly complementary and there is great potential and
prosperous future of cooperation in trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He said as long as the countries in the two regions make joint
efforts and put the relationship of cooperation on the basis of
equality and non-discrimination, the potential will be turned to
reality.
</P>
<P>
Li also announced that in a bid to realize Premier Li Peng's
proposals on new partnership of the two regions, which were put
forward at ASEM and prompt full development of Euro-Asia trade
cooperation, China will call an experts' meeting on the fields of
agriculture, environment protection and reform of business
technology in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement were welcomed by the participants of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was described by its organizers as being
successful, getting constructive results, embodying the spirits of
the Bangkok ASEM and creating conditions for the convention of
WTO's ministerial meeting in December in Singapore.

<P>
DHAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to set up a new export processing zone (EPZ) to meet
increased demand for export oriented industries of investors from

million U.S. dollars), will cover an area of 500 acres in Gazipur,
more than 200 kilometers to the north of Dhaka, with 200 acres to
be primarily developed as infrastructure for new industries.
</P>
<P>
The country now has two EPZs -- one in Dhaka and the other in
its largest port city of Chittagong.

expand the existing Dhaka EPZ with a total cost of 600 million
taka (about 15 million dollars). The construction is scheduled to
start this month and be completed in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes To Further Economic Cooperation With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade relations
between China and the European Union (EU) have been good in
general, but some obstacles are still to be removed, vice Chinese
Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said today.
</P>
<P>
He is here attending an informal meeting of senior officials
from 25 Asian and European countries. It is being held as a
follow-up to the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to liberalize
trade and investment between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Li, also head of the Chinese
delegation to the meeting, said China attaches great importance to
Sino-European economic and trade cooperation, while the 15-member
EU also approved last year a long-term China policy which included
proposals on promoting its trade and investment with China.
</P>
<P>
China was the EU's fourth biggest trading partner, and vice
versa, last year, with a trade volume valued at 40.34 billion
U.S. dollars, Li said.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, The number of EU projects in China had reached 5,837,
with a contract value totalling 20.2 billion dollars and real
investment of 6.2 billion dollars. It was topped by the United
States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
EU countries accounted for a massive 48.8 percent of government
loans to China, valued at 11.8 billion dollars by 1995, he
continued. Cooperation also existed in science and technology,
developmental aid and staff training.
</P>
<P>
However, Li pointed out that furthering economic and trade
relations between China and the EU were not free of obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The EU retained an import quota on China's shoes, toys and
several other kinds of goods, and implemented repeatedly and at
will anti-dumping measures against China's exports. In contrast,
China had always adopted a non-discriminative trade policy towards
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Li hoped the meeting and the ASEM would play a role in pushing
the healthy development of cooperation between China and the EU.
</P>
<P>
It was announced at the meeting that China was due to host a
meeting of experts on Asia-Europe economic and technical
cooperation next year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Blows South Korea Out of Olympic Men Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Marco Branca scored two goals to
pace Italy for its first victory of 2-1 on Thursday, knocking
South Korea out of the Olympic men's soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, Alabama, South Korea that stood on 1-1-1 in
Group C, was in dire need of a victory for its voyage into the
quarterfinals, but the Italians testified their superiority in the
sport than the Asian footers at least.
</P>
<P>
Although Italy was out of the tournament prior to the game, its
victory helped Ghana to advance to the quarterfinals ahead of
South Korea on goal difference as both stood on four points.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Ghana and Mexico played to a 1-1 draw and both
go through to the quarter finals.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's account was opened in the 44th minute through an own
goal from Pavel Pardo before Mexico equalised through Jose Abundis
in the 66th minute.
</P>
<P>
Mexico won the group title from a win and two draws.
</P>
<P>
Brazil breezed across Nigeria 1-0 for its berth in the quarter
finals of the Olympic soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Played in Miami, Florida, Ronaldhino scored the lone goal of
the Group D game in the 30th minute.
</P>
<P>
Brazil finished atop the group with two wins and one defeat and
Nigeria ranked second with the same point of seven on goal
difference.
</P>
<P>
The bad omen becked to Japan that lost the chance to advance
further despite its victory of 3-2 in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
While Brazil, Nigeria and Japan each scored six points from
three games, Japan ranked third on poor goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Brazil stole the top spot with four goals against two and
Nigeria came second with three goals against one, while Japan
enjoyed zero goal difference.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese still had something to cherish before
their flight back home.
</P>
<P>
In the game against Hungary that tailed in the group, Japanese
Kenichi Uemura and Masakiya Maezono scored in the dying seconds
for their victory, only without enough goals for their hopeful
booking of a spot in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Tamas Sandor put Hungary ahead in the second minute and Maezono
equalised before the break, but Hungary surged ahead anew through
Csaba Madar in the 51st minute.

<HEADLINE> China Snatch First Win in Women's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China cauptured its first win
after two defeats at the Olympic women's baskeball tournament on
Thursday, beating Canada 61-49 in Group A.
</P>
<P>
The 2.04-meter tall center Zheng Haixiao led China with a
game-high 19 points and 16 rebounds, while Liu Jun came from the
bench to add 12 for the Chinese team, which shot 21-41 from the
feilds and 10-16 at the line.
</P>
<P>
Chian put up tough defence to hold Canada scoreless for five
minutes at the end of the game when they took a 12-0 run to snatch
the victory, their first win after surprising losses to Italy and
Japan in the 12-team tournament at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians had a poor shooting percentage of 37% from the
field. Beerly Smith, Shawna Molcak and Daine Norman each scored
eight points to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese team had to overcome a slow start when they
trailed the Canadians 11-0 in the first three minutes of the game
before Zheng Haixia, a four-time Olympic verteran, made the first
basekt for China.
</P>
<P>
With Zheng's strong underbasket attacks and outside shots from
guard Li Xin, the Chinese girls surged ahead at 23-21 when Shen Li
drilled a three pointer with 4:16 munites left in the first half.
They went on to take a 28-25 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team took a mere 1 to 3 points lead all the way in
the second half until their last burst.
</P>
<P>
"Our shooting was not very good at the beginning of the game
but we changed to the zone defence and used the rebounders for
fast-breaks," said Chinese head coach Chen Daohong.
</P>
<P>
In their next two group games the Chinese cagers will take on
old rivals Brazil on Saturday and Russia next Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Tops Group A in Women's Soccer Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China entered the semifinals of
the women's soccer tournament by standing atop in the preliminary
Group E of the Olympic Games after playing a scoreless game with
the United States on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the heat of Miami, the Chinese women footers enjoyed their
upperhands in speed but failed to capitulize on numerous chances
throughout the tight match.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liping missed her close-range kick in the 20th minute
before American goalie Briana Scurry ran to and from with her
dives to ensure the host undefeated in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
In front of the partisan crowd, the Americans also had their
scoring chance in the 17th minute when a goal-bound kick from
Kristine Lilly was tipped over the bar by Chinese goalkeeper Gao
Hong.
</P>
<P>
The top-form Chinese goalie helped her squad to keep its clean
slate, edging over the United States on goal difference for the
top spot in the group.
</P>
<P>
In their previous three games, undefeated China had scored
seven goals against one while the United States, that also won two
games early, stood on five against one.
</P>
<P>
Both Sweden that lost two games and Denmark that was still to
win its first game, were eliminated from the last four in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Without any hope of advancing further in the tournament, Sweden
still went to beat Denmark 3-1 to justify their prowess in the
pitch in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Malin Swedberg netted twice and Lena Videkull added the third
to the honour of their country.
</P>
<P>
In the other group F, Norway and Brazil became the leaders and
secured the other semifinal spots while both Germany and Japan
were ousted from the top four.
</P>
<P>
World champions Norway has kept its winning streak intact by
routing Japan with four goals against nil in Washington despite
the absence of midfielder Heidi Stoere who may be sidelined for
seven months due to a damaged knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
Marianne Pettersen scored twice in the 25th and 86th minutes
with Linda Medalen netting her third of the tournament in the 60th
and substitute Trine Tangeraas slamming home the fourth goal in
the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also entered the semifinals by winning one game and
drewing two others in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, Alabama, Sissi scored her 53rd-minute equaliser
for Brazil for a 1-1 tie against Germany 1-1, which enables Brazil
to survive and kicks Germany out of the last four.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the game, Germany still harbored the hope of vying for
a medal with a victory while Brazil stood on one win and one draw.
</P>
<P>
The Germans who went ahead through Pia Wunderlich in the fourth
minute, were shocked by the tie and kneed down in desperation
after the final whistle.

<HEADLINE> Kiraly, Smith Set for Showdown in Beach Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Karch Kiraly and Sinjin Smith will
meet Friday to decide who will enter Saturday's medal round of the
double-elimination Olympic beach volleyball tournament in
Jonesboro, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Kiraly and partner Kent Steffes reached Friday's match with a
15-5 victory over Germany's Jorg Ahmann and Axel Hager. Smith and
Carl Henkel had a much more difficult time in a match against
Cubans Francisco Alvarez and Juan Miguel Rosell.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans rallied from a 10-3 deficit to tie it at 12-all
before the U.S. won 15-13. Alvarez was called for a mishandled
ball at the net while the Americans were leading 13-12, a ruling
that prompted Rosell to charge the referees' chair and slam his
fists on the platform.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans were penalized one point, then fended off six match
points before losing.
</P>
<P>
The matches are held in the 9,000-seat main stadium court at
Atlanta Beach, a complex built especially for the inaugural
Olympic beach volleyball competition.
</P>
<P>
Also staying undefeated Thursday was the other U.S. men's team,
Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh, who defeated the Brazilian duo of
Marco Ferreira and Emanuel Scheffer 15-9.
</P>
<P>
In another match, Australia's Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst
defeated Holly McPeak and Nancy Reno of the United States 15-13.

<HEADLINE> Panama Call for University-Private Enterprise Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares proposed today a closer relationship between
universities and private enterprises to strengthen the scientific
awareness of the enterprise sector.
</P>
<P>
He made the recommendation while attending the opening session
of the "Let's Do Business "University-Enterprise National Forum".
</P>
<P>
The president told the forum that the traditional way of
linking universities to the productive sectors by providing human
resources to business was not sufficient, and it was most
important to establish permanent connections between them.
</P>
<P>
In this way enterprises could renew themselves all the time and
be prepared for market competition, and be in a position to
overcome lack of resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president added that the governments should play the role
of catalyst to promote this rapprochement.

<HEADLINE> Czech Government Survives Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The 21-day-old Czech coalition
government today survived a confidence vote after the opposition
Social Democrats implicitly supported it by leaving parliament
shortly before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The vote was called after many opposition deputies sharply
criticized the work of the government during the deliberation of
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' policy program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In today's vote, Klaus won support for his policy program from
98 deputies, a majority of the deputies present in the
parliament. But 40 other deputies, from the opposition Republican
and Communist parties, voted against Klaus, and no one abstained.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, all 61 deputies from the main opposition
Social Democratic Party walked out of the parliament, giving an
easy victory to the ruling coalition, which lost its majority in
the 200-seat parliament in the May 31-June 1 elections.
</P>
<P>
The three ruling parties -- the Civic Democratic Party led by
Klaus, the Christian Democratic Party and the Civic Democratic
Alliance -- now hold a total of 99 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
One Social Democratic deputy told reporters that his party did
not trust the ruling coalition and nobody would expect it to
support the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But he added that in regard for social stability, the party
decided not to participate in the confidence vote to allow the
minority government to stay.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Sees Rapid Growth In Residents' Bank Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The country's first Special
Economic Zone has not suffered any drop in the growth of
individual deposits, since the city decided to cut interest rates
by an average of 0.83 percentage points in May.
</P>
<P>
Monthly deposits per head of local population in the first half
of this year reached 290 yuan, a rise of almost 74 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bank withdrawals each month by local residents
dropped by 30.8 percent to slightly under 132 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen made the cuts after the country's central bank decided
to lower interest rates by an average 0.75 percent on loans, and
by 0.98 percent on deposits on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen is the only city in China empowered by the central
government to decide interest rates for itself," a local observer
said. The city's cuts in rates were lower than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cuts did not bring any negative influence on
confidence by local people with putting their money in banks.
</P>
<P>
Spending in the first half of this year by local people rose by
just six yuan over the same period last year, even though their
per capita income surged 20 percent in the meantime, according to
a recent report on what local residents do with their money.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts pointed out that local residents put more
money in banks, due to the insufficiency in employment caused by
the poor economic performance of the state-owned enterprises. The
residents are more cautious in spending their money.

The industry generates 40 million yuan in advertising income
alone every year.
</P>

The city's pager subscribers have access to provincial and
national roaming services, and even a pager connection with Hong
Kong.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Form of Poverty Relief For Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A new poverty relief program that
provides low-interest loans for small household businesses is
being applied in the Tibet Autonomous Region in the four poor
counties of Tingri, Dinggye, Nyalam, and Gyirong, and in the Mount
Qomolangma Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
In April of last year, the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) signed an agreement with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation and the reserve's Working
Committee, providing 880,000 US dollars in aid to China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government and Tibet Autonomous regional
government are providing additional funds in support of the
program.
</P>
<P>
Designed by the Research Institute for Rural Development of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the program is designed to
offer small amounts of direct low-interest loans to those poor
families, especially to women in need, who are running small
household businesses.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, a similar program has proven rather successful
in Henan and Hebei provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Working Committee has organized a training session for 45
local rural people from the four counties to give them a better
understanding of the credit program.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyima Yangzom, an official with the committee, the
program mainly helps local women to get involved in livestock
raising and making handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed confidence that the poor Tibetan women
in such areas, who tend to be diligent and thrifty, will go in for
household economy by raising livestock and poultry and making
handicraft articles and gradually improve their livelihoods with
the financial and technical aid.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Sets New Asian Record in Men's 50m Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chengji of China rewrote his
own Asian record of the men's 50 meters freestyle event in the
final here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Jiang from Shanghai clocked a time of 22.33
seconds to finish fourth, slicing 0.22 seconds off his half day
long Asian mark set in the heats this morning.
</P>
<P>
The 1.90-meter swimmer clocked 22.55 seconds this morning to
shatter the 14-year-old mark established by Ang Peng-Siong of
Singapore in Indianapolis on August 20, 1982.
</P>
<P>
"The result belongs my hard training," said Jiang, "I think it
has completely proved my ability."
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things that I just cann't control in the
competitions, so far I'm satisfied with my performance."
</P>
<P>
Jiang was also finished fourth in the 100m butterfly, the best
placing ever for a Chinese male swimmer in the Olympic Games and
twice broke the Asian record in the event.
</P>
<P>
"I still feel somewhat disappointed (not winning a medal at the
Olympics). However, I'm happy to have the chance to experience
such a big clash, especially competing against top-class swimmers
such as Alexander Popov."
</P>
<P>
Jiang's coach Zhou Ming said: "He started well in the final. In
the sprints, swimmers from European countries take the absolute
dominance. Jiang's entering into the final is a breakthrough for
us. "
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, I believe there would be more Chinese male
swimmers to be able to compete against their European
counterparts," said Zhou, also coach for Le Jingyi.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Popov of Russia chalked up the gold medal with 22.13.
</P>
<P>
Gary Hall of the United States, who came from the right
swimming bloodlines, was again edged into the second by his
arch-rival.
</P>
<P>
Popov chalked up two world titles in the 50m and 100m
freestyle, beating Hall into the silver, at the World
Championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Scherer claimed a bronze for Brazil, finishing third
at 22.29.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Wins, Evans Beaten in Women's 800m Free Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Brooke Bennett of the United
States chalked up the women's 800-meter freestyle crown with a
clocking of 8:27.89 here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old girl, top finisher in the morning's heats,
proved that she was the current number one female distance swimmer
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bennett edged her closet rival Dagmar Hase of Germany to the
second place by almost one and a half body length.
</P>
<P>
Hase was timed in 8:29.91 for the silver medal, followed by
Kirsten Vileghuis of the Netherlands at the third place with a
time of 8:30.84.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Janet Evans, found that she could not match
the pace of Bennett and other swimmers. She is just too old for
the long and tiring race.
</P>
<P>
Evan, with three world records and six American national
records in hand, again had to settle for the sixth place in the
final with a time of 8:38.91. The mark is nearly 22 seconds off
her world record she set in Tokyo seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I have tried my best," Evans said at the press conference,
with tears in her eyes, "Anyway, this will not be my last
800-meter competition."
</P>
<P>
Asked what she would do after the Olympics, she answered: "I
will take a long vacation and go home to unify with my family."

<HEADLINE> Software Piracy in Mexico Causes $250 Million Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Software piracy caused a loss
of 250 million U.S. dollars to Mexico's computer industry in 1995,
a Mexican official said today.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Adame, president of the National Association of the
Computer Programs Industry, said the losses also affected the
growth of national developers and the income of the industry.
</P>
<P>
There were now 2.3 million personal computers in the country,
with an average of three programs installed in each. Eighty
percent of the programs were pirated ones, which affected 80
percent of legally installed enterprises in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
He said a program would be implemented next month to fight
software piracy.
</P>
<P>
He commented that this program would be carried out in
coordination with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property,
and the special prosecutorship of crimes against intellectual
property of the General Procuratorship.
</P>
<P>
People in possession of pirated software could be fined at
least 20,000 pesos (about 2857 dollars), sentenced to one to six
years in prison and have their computers confiscated and
businesses involved in the illegal trade of computer programs
closed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Financial Sector Reports Healthy Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
economic center, has scored healthy and steady growth in its
financial sector during the first half of the year, according to
local government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The local banking sector has provided about two billion yuan
more in credit through June 30 compared with the same period last
year, as banks beefed up efforts to provide better financing for
large and medium-sized state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Half of the loans from the Shanghai Branch of the Industrial
and Commercial Bank during this period went to the state sector,
backbone industries, and efficient profitable enterprises, 87
percent of that being for operating capital, providing
considerable relief for their capital shortage.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits were up nearly 37 billion yuan from the
beginning of the year, representing an increase of almost 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
The capital market in Shanghai is active and heading for an
upturn after a long correctional period. The volume increased
almost 208.3 billion yuan for the first six months this year,
nearly two-thirds greater than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 336.1 billion yuan worth of treasury bond were traded
during this period, more than triple last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Inter-bank lending and borrowing has also gone smoothly and
trading is normal since early this year, with capital pooled by
the Shanghai fund-raising center hitting 79.3 billion yuan for the
first half.
</P>
<P>
The local foreign exchange transaction center reported a volume
of 29.71 billion US dollars traded for the six-month period, and
Shanghai's financial sector continues to open wider to overseas
financiers, with 41 foreign banks having opened branches and 143
representative offices already having opened in the municipality
by the end of June.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Vichairachanon Khadpo of Thailand
got up from a second-round knockdown and boxed his way into the
54-kilogram quarterfinals Thursday night at the Olympics.

round, moved to his right early in the second round and got caught
by a right hand to the left side of the head that put him down.
Khadpo jumped up and went on to a 14-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Bae Ho-Jo was eliminated by Oleg Saitov of Russia
at 67kg class. The Russian, a bronze medalist at the 1995 world
championships and this year's European championships, showed
powerfully against the left-handed Bae.
</P>
<P>
Chinese heavyweight Jiang Tao won his opening bout with a
decision over Ovidiu Bali of Romania. Jiang outscored Bali by a
10-7 margin to win before a large crowd at the Alexander Memorial
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
Bae Ki-Woong of South Korea lost his 54 kilogram bout on an
11-10 decision to Uavacatseren Tseyen-Oidov of Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> Central America Criticizes US Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Central American
Parliament President Raul Saldivar today criticized the
U.S. Helms-Burton law, saying U.S. President Bill Clinton was
using the law to boost his reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
Saldivar made the comments while visiting the Panamanian
Congress as member of a Parlacen delegation and the Central
American Court of Justice
</P>
<P>
He said the law violates the principles of sovereignty of the
countries, and Clinton, who will seek to be reelected in November,
has not enforced the law because of the "opportunism" connected to
the U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
Saldivar called for a joint action of all regional
organizations of the continent to prevent the application of the
law.
</P>
<P>
The United States promulgated in March this year the
Helms-Burton law in an attempt to hamper foreign investment in
Cuba by applying penalties to entrepreneurs and companies doing
business in the island.

Seles, in the round of 16, will meet former U.S. Open champion

comfort the Red Army veterans and their families, who are still
alive six decades after the event that changed the course of
Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The Organization Department of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee has issued a notice, requiring all local
governments and Party committees to visit and comfort the
remaining veterans who participated in the Chinese revolution in
1920s and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, nearly 120,000 Red
Army veterans, including retired soldiers and those who were
separated from the main units during the Long March, are still
living in villages, townships and cities throughout China.
</P>
<P>
The current notice calls on local authorities to carry out a
general survey of the Red Army veterans and relatives of soldiers
who have since died, to help relieve any difficulties they have in
their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Proposed activities include artistic performances, exhibitions,
visits, seminars and discussions for the veterans.
</P>
<P>
The veterans are also being encouraged to give reports to the
younger generations on hardship and patriotic education. The Red
Army, led by the Communist Party of China, reached Yan'an, a
revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, in 1935
after one-year hard journey of more than 10,000
kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Gets 270-Million US Dollar Loan for Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A 270-million US Dollar syndicated
loan has been raised to support Chinese exports to be used in the
construction of a subway system in the capital of Iran, according
to Friday's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed yesterday in Beijing between the
Chinese syndicate, composed of 14 major banks in the country, and
Bank Tejarat of Iran, the borrower.
</P>
<P>
The money, used as buyer's export credit, will finance a
Chinese consortium led by China International Trust and Investment
Corp (Citic) to supply power, signalling, ventilation and
maintenance equipment for the construction of subway lines one and
two in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest export credit arranged by Chinese banks for
an overseas project, according to Citic.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Subway deal is so far the largest export of
civilian products China has ever clinched.
</P>
<P>
Iran decided to build the subway in the early 1990s when
international bidding was held for the purchase of machinery.
High prices quoted by Western suppliers and its relations with the
West led to Iran's decision to award the project to China.
</P>
<P>
The project was proposed by the then President Yang Shangkun of
China and President Hashemi Rafhsanjani of Iran in 1991, and
further promoted by Vice-Premier Li Lanqing in 1993 when he
visited Iran.
</P>
<P>
Citic defeated other competitors and signed the export contract
valued at 298 million US Dollar in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Citic deal, Changchun Rolling Stocks Works will
supply 218 passenger cars and China North Industries Corp has been
awarded a contract to build an electric railway in the suburbs of
Teheran. The three contracts form an integrated underground system
project.
</P>
<P>
The Citic consortium includes China National Electric Equipment
Corp, China Railway Signal and communications Corp and Shanghai
Electric Group Corp.
</P>
<P>
The loan syndicate includes China Construction Bank, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Shanghai and Tokyo
Branches of the Bank of Communications, Citic Industrial Bank,
Bank of China, Export and Import Bank of China, Agricultural Bank
of China and several local banks in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Steps up Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Tibet, known as the "roof of the
world," remains free from pollution as a result of regulations
designed to step up environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhichang, director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Department of Urban and Rural Environmental protection, said that
over the past few years the regional government and the Regional
People's Congress Standing Committee have set forth more than 20
sets of regulations on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the regulations deal with the protection of forests
and wildlife, the management of water sources, mining and urban
development, and the collection of fees for pollution control.
</P>
<P>
The Decision on the Stepping up of Environmental Protection,
adopted by the Regional People's Congress Standing Committee,
states that economic development, urban and rural construction and
environmental protection must develop and be designed and
undertaken simultaneously, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Regulations Concerning the Assessment of
the Impact of Construction Projects on Environment, all people who
undertake new construction projects must see to it that pollution
control facilities are designed, built and go into operation at
the same time as the principal part of the projects.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the autonomous regional government has
submitted the Regulations Governing the Management of Nature
Reserves and Regulations Regarding Environmental Protection in
Towns and Cities to the Regional People's Congress for examination.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has effectively controlled pollution thanks to its
government efforts to speed up legislation on environmental
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released by the regional government,
suspended particles in the air over the regional capital of Lhasa
cover 293 microns per cubic meter daily, meeting the national
standard for clean air.
</P>
<P>
Rivers in Tibet are limpid and clean, and their water content
of major chemical indexes complies with national standards for
clean water.
</P>
<P>
To date, 13 nature reserves have been set up on 1.2 million
square kilometers of land in Tibet. The reserves cover a total
area of 325,400 square kilometers, 26.5 percent of Tibet's land
mass.
</P>
<P>
The communique shows that Tibet has 6.32 million hectares of
forests with timber reserves totaling 436 million cubic meters,
ranking the second in China.

<HEADLINE> Podkopayeva Wins Women's Gymnastics All-Around Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Lilia Podkopayeva of Ukraine
collected a total of 39.255 points to win the women's gymnastics
all-around title here today at the current Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Gina Gogean of Romania finished second with 39.075 points ahead
of her teammates Simona Amanar and and Lavinia Milosovici who
shared the bronze medal at 39.067.
</P>
<P>
China's Mo Huilan, Asian Games all-around champion in 1994, led
the field after three rotations with a 29.399 total, 0.031 points
ahead of Podkopayeva, world all-around champion last year.
</P>
<P>
Podkopayeva did a so-so performance but scored 9.887 points in
the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
It added a huge pressure to Mao, who had to score 9.867 points
to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chinese opened brilliantly in the floor
exercises, but steped out of the carpet following a combination of
difficult actions.
</P>
<P>
That only brought her a low 9.650 score and Mo dropped to the
fifth place in 39.049 points.
</P>
<P>
"The judges here are not fair enough. I believe that the score
they sent to the winner is too high, but the points they gave Mao
too low," conplained Qian Kui, the head coach of the Chinese team
after the competition.
</P>
<P>
During today's competitions, Shannon Miller and Dominique
Dawes, members of the team titlists the United States, disppointed
the local fans by wrapping up 10th and 20th respectively.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- German shooters ended the nation's
gold drought by bagging two titles on Thursday, six days into the
Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Christian Klees shattered the world final record of the men's
free rifle prone shooting to win the gold medal, while defending
champion Ralf Schumann triumphed convincingly in the men's rapid
fire pistol event.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Klees evened the world record of 600 points in
the preliminaries and then kept his momentum to beat the world
final mark of 703.5 points by totolling 704.8.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Beliaev of Kazakhstan, fourth in the qualifying round,
shot the best final score of 105.3 for a total of 703.3 to pick up
the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Jozef Gonzi, a left-handed Slovakian marksman who came second
to the German in the preliminaries with one point short, felt his
left palm hurt midway in the final.
</P>
<P>
He placed third at 701.9 to clinch the first Olympic medal for
Slovakia which gained independence just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"If the injury hadn't bothered me, I could have done better,"
he said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Klees said he did not feel pressure throughout the final and
became even more relaxed before the last shot, which had cost her
compatriot Petra Horneber a gold medal in the women's air rifle
event last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Beliaev had a different feeling. "I feel pressured, and only
pressure can make me shoot better," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Shooting has changed my life, my characters," the 36-year-old
mine engineer said. "I do things more seriously now."
</P>
<P>
Conci, a soldier in the Slovak army, said he was proud of
winning the first Olympic medal for Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what color the medal is, " he said. "This is the
first, I made the history, I am really proud of it."
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Schumann, who have won most of his
international appearances since 1985, became the first shooter to
successfully defend the Olympic title here.
</P>
<P>
Schumann garnered 698.0 points for a new Olympic final record,
beating Bulgarian Emil Milev by nearly six points.
</P>
<P>
Milev grabbed the silver in a total of 692.1 points while
Vladimir Vokhmyanin of Kazakhstan, bronze medalist in the
Barcelona Games, finished third again after scoring 691.5 points.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of people going
on-line is skyrocketing, but most still don't find cyberspace
compelling, according to a study revealed by the newspaper USA
Today.
</P>
<P>
About 35 million in the United States aged 16 and over said
they used on-line services or the Internet in the first three
months of 1996, according to a poll by the technology research
company IntelliQuest.
</P>
<P>
About 26 percent, 9 million users, went on line this year, the
study showed.
</P>
<P>
Still, 40 percent of users, about 14 million, spend less than
two hours a week on line, it said. Only 8 percent, or 2.6 million,
spend more than 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
People tend to focus more on useful and satisfactory
information and are unwilling to waste time on trash, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in electronic commerce will depend on "converting people
who already have access into medium or heavy users," according to
the surveyors who did random phone calls with 4,750 households in
April and May.

<HEADLINE> New British Shadow Cabinet Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Opposition leader Tony
Blair won a vote of confidence from Labor MPs Wednesday night when
all members of his chosen frontbench team were re-elected to the
shadow cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The embattled shadow health secretary Harriet Harman survived
the fury of many backbenchers over her decision to send her
younger son to a selective grammar school. Jack Cunningham, who
lost his place last year, came back to take the vacancy left by
Joan Lestor's decision to stand down.
</P>
<P>
Though Harman was in last place, well down the field with 149
votes against Tom Clarke's 175 in 18th position, she was 55 votes
clear of Ann Clwyd, another ex-shadow cabinet member who had been
backed by some MPs to oust Harman.
</P>
<P>
None of the seven backbench leftwingers succeeded in their
challenge for the 19 available places, giving Blair the team he
wants to take the party into the general election.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports here, aides to Blair served notice
Wednesday night that he would clamp down on dissent now the vote
was out of the way. A committee of MPs is to look into the
structures which will govern the relationship between backbenchers
and a future Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Blair described the results as a vindication of the decision to
call the annual election three months earlier than usual. The
vote, he said, was "for unity and a winning team." A senior party
official described the vote as "an important test of authority."
</P>
<P>
Under party rules, the outcome of the poll should determine the
membership of the cabinet if Labor wins the next election.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the newly elected shadow cabinet members
and junior front-benchers traveled to Templeton College, Oxford,
today for a seminar on preparing for government.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rebounded
today after an early jump on an encouraging profit report from IBM
and other major blue chips.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.32 to 5,422.01.
</P>
<P>
IBM, which reported an expected quarterly profit, saw its
shares surging by about 12 percent, accounting for more than half
of the blue-chip barometer's advance.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials also were lifted by Boeing and DuPont,
which reported profits in line with forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the total volume declining to
403.62 million shares from 460.99 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.30 to 338.37; and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.53 to 631.18.
</P>
<P>

1,059.80; and the American Stock Exchange's market value index
rose 3.59 to 532.59.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also bolstered by falling interest rates in the
bond market, where the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped
below 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Noise Detected in "Black Box" From Crashed Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The tape of the cockpit voice
recorder from the crashed Trans World Airlines plane ends abruptly
11 minutes after takeoff with a brief noise that may explain the
cause of the explosion, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
said today.
</P>
<P>
"We know there was a catastrophic explosion; it was caused by
some kind of a bomb, obviously," said James Kallstrom, assistant
FBI director, after a preliminary analysis of the tape.
</P>
<P>
"We're not further describing how that would be, whether it was
carried on, whether something hit the plane from outside and
caused it to explode or a mechanical problem that has nothing to
do with terrorism or criminality or something in the cargo that
would have caused a mechanical problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Robert
Francis said that the noise was very short, it was just a
"fraction-of-a-second sound just prior to the end of the tape."
</P>
<P>
Francis also said that the flight data recorder also could not
help investigators give any quick answer to the cause of the plane
crash.
</P>
<P>
But he said detailed tests will be conducted on the tape to
learn more about the sound. The data recorder's tape was
contaminated by water and also will be studied further, he said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called black boxes were rushed to Washington soon after
they were recovered from the sea floor Wednesday night for study.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-bound Boeing 747 exploded shortly after takeoff on
July 17 from the New York Kennedy International Airport, killing
all 230 people aboard. Officials hope to learn whether the
explosion shortly after takeoff on July 17 was caused by a bomb,
missile or mechanical failure.

<HEADLINE> White House Urges Congress to Act on Thrift Fund Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
urged the Congress to take actions to rescue the Thrift Fund which
secures Americans' deposits.
</P>
<P>
Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, made the call in
a letter sent to House Speaker Newt Gingrich as the Banking
Committee of the House of Representatives began considering
several options to revive the fund.
</P>
<P>
A plan in Congress to revive the ailing savings and loan (S&AMP;L)
insurance fund is one of the "foremost and urgent priorities" of
the Clinton administration, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
In responding the call from the government, the House Banking
Committee voted today to tap U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) surpluses
to cover 3 billion dollars of the cost of cleaning up the S&AMP;L
losses of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The fund, known as the Savings Association Insurance Fund, or
SAIF, insures S&AMP;L deposits up to 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
While most of the nation's S&AMP;Ls are financially strong, the
SAIF's reserves have been depleted, partly due to repayment of
bonds from the S&AMP;L crisis of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The banking committee is considering several options to revive
the fund, which could then lead to a merger of S&AMP;Ls and commercial
bank charters. The options include levying special fees on banks
or the gigantic mortgage companies, such as the Federal National
Mortgage Association, popularly known as Fannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks have bitterly fought an earlier proposal to
share the financial burden of reviving the S&AMP;L fund, and Fannie
Mae has lobbied heavily against its participation as well.
</P>
<P>
House Banking Chairman Jim Leach said he recognized the
political difficulty of reaching an agreement.

ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have unearthed the
largest hominoid fossils ever found at an excavation site in
Ankara, according to Anatolia News Agency here today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted archaeologists as saying that the fossils belonged
to a hominoid which lived around 10 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
An Ankara University Professor introduced the hominoid's
jaw bone to the press, saying that there were no examples of
this species that are alive today.
</P>
<P>
He added that other animals' fossils had been found in
Ankara and that the excavation and research are continuing.
</P>
<P>
Anthropologists said that the discovery of the
hominoid raises questions about Darwin's theory linking humans,
chimpanzees and gorillas to orangutans.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
ordered tighter U.S. aviation security including more search of
luggage and more screen of bags as well as search of all airliners
to or from the United States before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
"The safety and security of the American people must be our top
priority," Clinton said after meeting in New York City families of
the victims of Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight 800, which
exploded and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on July 17 soon after
it took off from the New York JFK International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that authorities will hand search more luggage and
screen more bags and that all airliners, to or from the United
States, will be searched before takeoff. "Every plane, every
cabin, every cargo hold, every time," Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the new measures "could increase the
inconvenience and the expense of air travel," but he said the
administration would do its utmost to minimize the costs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also cautioned Americans not to jump to any conclusions
about the cause of the crash. "We do not know why TWA flight 800
crashed," the president said. "But we will find out."
</P>
<P>
Clinton assigned Vice President Al Gore to oversee a commission
that will conduct a top to bottom review of airline safety.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever needs to be done, we will do it," the president said,
adding that he would use "the full powers of the presidency" to do
what is necessary.
</P>
<P>
On another development, experts in Washington said today that
they expected to release results of an examination of the Boeing
747's "black box" flight and data recorders later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Navy divers recovered the black boxes in 30 meters of water in
the Atlantic Ocean Wednesday night and rushed them to the National
Transportation Safety Board laboratory in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The boxes had moderate damage but the tapes were healthy, said
Bernard Loeb, director of aviation safety for the National
Transportation Safety Board in Washington.
</P>
<P>
But the good condition of the tapes does not guarantee good
results, said Robert Benzon, a safety board investigator on Long
Island. Other officials also noted that if the jetliner suffered a
massive electrical failure before coming down, it might have shut
down the recorders prematurely.
</P>
<P>
Officials hope to learn whether the explosion shortly after
takeoff on July 17 was caused by a bomb, missile or mechanical
failure.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Muslim Government Pledges to Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Muslim government has
pledged to stop maltreatment of Serbs in Sarajevo, U.N. spokesman
Alexander Ivanko said in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
Muslim-Croat federation Premier Hasan Muratovic made the pledge
at a meeting with U.N. Special Envoy for Bosnia Izbal Riza and
head of the International Police Task Force (IPTF) Peter
Fitzgerald Wednesday, reports from Sarajevo quoted Ivanko as
saying at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Serbs have left Sarajevo's five Serb-held
districts before they were placed under control of the
Muslim-Croat federation in March, as called for by the Dayton
peace agreement which was signed in Paris in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, about 8,000 Serbs remain in Sarajevo but they have
unfortunately been maltreated by Muslims, including harassment,
intimidation and robbery.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said a group of Serbs had called on the IPTF to organize
a massive evacuation of Serbs from Sarajevo to Serb-held
territories to escape prejudice.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, Muslim authorities and police have
done nothing to prevent such persecution of Serbs in Sarajevo, and
their inaction in this regard has been repeatedly criticized by
international organizations based in these districts.

<HEADLINE> Outstanding Contributions to UN Total 2.9 Bln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Outstanding assessed
contributions to the United Nations amounted to 2.9 billion
dollars as of July 15, according to the office of the spokesman
for the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The statistics available today show that of the amount above,
830 million dollars was for the regular budget and 2.1 billion
dollars for peacekeeping operations. An additional 25 million
dollars was owed for the International Tribunals.
</P>
<P>
So far, 80 of the 185 member states have paid in full their
regular assessments, including such major contributors as four of
the five permanent representatives to the United Nations, Japan
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, arrears of the United States alone came to 1.67
billion dollars, accounting for over 50 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said that many member countries fail to pay their
dues on time for a variety of reasons, ranging from budgetary
technicalities to simple poverty. Others have withheld payments as
a pressure tactic or to make a political point.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations ran out of regular budget money to pay its
bills since April 30. The organization has to borrow up to 287
million dollars in peacekeeping funds to cover regular budget for
the rest of this year, according to U.N. financial experts.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Croatia's Law Blocks Serbs' Return to Krajina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The massive return of Serbs to
Krajina area in Croatia has been blocked by the Croatian Law on
Amnesty, a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Elkhoury of the UNHCR Belgrade Office told a press
conference that Croatia and its President Franjo Tudjman, being
signatory to the Dayton agreement, were obligated to enable all
refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, together with Serbia and Bosnia, signed the Dayton
agreement in Paris last December. Under the peace agreement, all
the refugees have the right to return to their places of origin.
</P>
<P>
Elkhoury said his office had so far returned to Croatia no more
than 41 refugees, while it was processing 1,000 requests by
persons willing to go back. There are about 700,000 refugees from
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia living in Yugoslavia now.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross were
preparing a project of the Serbs' return to Krajina, Elkhoury
said. If the project succeeded, around 40,000 people would return
to Krajina before the winter, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Serbs escaped from the self-claimed Serb Republic
of Krajina when Croatian government troops launched an offensive
last year to seize the Serb areas. Most of them have flooded into
Yugoslavia and some fled to Bosnian Serb-held territories.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Dollar Remains Linked With S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The weakening South African
currency Rand has boosted certain sectors of the Namibian economy and
the two currencies should remain linked, said an eceonomic review
released here today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic review, South Africa's leading insurance
group Old Mutual said Namibian exporters would benefit tremendously
from the devaluation of the Namibian Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian Dollar has been linked with South African Rand as a
member of the Comman Monetary Area, which also included Swaziland and
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has depreciated by about 20 percent since mid-February in
the international financial market.
</P>
<P>
However, the review indicated that Namibia's economy is not
expected to show much growth this year due to severe drought, poor
fish catches and rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to Old Mutual, Namibian inflation should not become a
problem and the country could expect lower prime and home loan rates
by the end of 1996 and into next year.
</P>
<P>
Namibian fiscal policy is also supportive of growth, with the
emphasis on capital spending, said the review.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Trial Heading for Jury: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Arkansas bankers broke the
law to promote Bill Clinton's political career and conspired with
his 1990 gubernatorial campaign treasurer Bruce Lindsey to conceal
campaign withdrawals, said a prosecutor today.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor was speaking to a Whitewater jury in closing
arguments in Little Rock, Arkansas. The defense called the
allegation "just preposterous."
</P>
<P>
The case of Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert M. Hill, co-owners of
Perry County Bank, was expected to go to the jury later today,
after the jury of eight men and four women heard 21 days of
testimony, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two owners of Perry County Bank, which bankrolled Clinton's
1990 gubernatorial campaign, are charged with diverting their
bank's money into the campaign coffers of Clinton and other
Arkansas politicians.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged the bankers conspired to conceal from the
Internal Revenue Service 52,500 dollars in cash withdrawals by the
Clinton for Governor campaign in 1990, and misapply 13,000 dollars
in bank funds over four years to reimburse contributions to
Clinton and other politicians. A federal law requires banks to
report transactions exceeding 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, now White House deputy counsel aide, was named an
unindicted co-conspirator in this trial. Clinton is not accused of
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments today, chief prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing
Jr., alleged there was a "conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
But Branscum's attorney, Dan Guthrie, told the jury in his
summation that Branscum had no reason to try to curry favor with
Clinton, whom he had known since the early 1970s, and that Perry
County Bank charged Clinton's campaign 12 percent interest -- the
highest rate that can be charged under the law -- in approving
285,000 dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
"That whole notion of trying to ingratiate himself with Bill
Clinton ... is just preposterous," the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim the bankers broke the law to ingratiate
themselves with Clinton, who appointed them to influential state
positions.
</P>
<P>
In videotaped testimony last week, the president said both men
were deserving of the appointments -- Branscum to the state
Highway Commission and Hill to the state Banking Board.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie has alleged the trial was a political prosecution to
embarrass the president.

<HEADLINE> France Wins Third Olympic Gold in Judo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- French judoka Marie-Claire Restoux
defeated her South Korean rival in the women's 52-kg class,
awarding the third gold medal for her country in the Olympic judo
tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the last two judo gold medals at stake on Friday, France
has become the big winner so far with three gold and three bronze
medals from the 14-gold bonanza wherein each event ushers in two
third-place finishers.
</P>
<P>
Both Japan and South Korea bagged home two gold medals apiece
while Japan has won three silver and one bronze more, and South
Korea increased its harvest with four silvers and two bronzes.
</P>
<P>
The other five judo gold medals offered in the first six days,
were split among China, Germany, Cuba, Belgium and Poland.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 65-kg half-lightweight class on Thursday, Udo
Quellmalz won the decision over Japanese Yukimasa Nakamura to
award the third gold medal for Germany in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
After its failure to make the way to the medal tally in the
first five competition, German grabbed three gold medals in a row
on Thursday when sharpshooters Christian Klees and Ralf Schumann
became the first two German Olympic champions in the shooting
competition early of the day.
</P>
<P>
Klees broke the world record en route to his victory in the
men's 50-meter rifle prone while compatriot Schumann edged over
Bulgarian Emil Milev to win the men's 25-meter rapid fire pistol.
</P>
<P>
As judo being its traditional sport, Japan was in no mood to
celebrate its scoreboard of two golds, three silvers and one
bronze.
</P>
<P>
Yuko Emoto became the first Japanese gold medalist when she
defeated Belgian Gella Vandecaveye in the women's 61-kg class on
Tuesday, and Kenzo Nakamura was the first Japanese male gold
medalist in Atlanta after his win over South Korean Kwak
Dae-Sung in the men's 71-kg category on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two gold medals for South Korea were from Cho Min-Sun in
the women's 66kg and Jeon Ki-Young in the men's 86kg on Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far, South Korea has won three gold medals from the
Centennial Olympic Games, with the other reapt from Sim Kwon-Ho in
the 48-kg Greco Roman wrestling competition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first judo gold medal was won by Sun Fuming of China in
the women's over 72-kg event.
</P>
<P>
The other judo champions were David Douillet of France, Ulla
Werbrouck of Belgium, Pawel Nastula of Poland, Djamel Bouras of
France and Driulis Gonzalez of Cuba.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Not To Recognise New Burundian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would not
recognize Burundi's new government, which came into power by
force, South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Nzo said the South African
government condemned the increasing senseless violence in Burundi
and would under no circumstances not recognize any change of
government in that country brought about "through force of arms".
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in the wake of the Burundian army's
announcement on Thursday that Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya had been ousted and replaced by former Head of
State Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
The South African government supported the stance of the
Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution
of the Organisation of African Unity, which sought a peaceful
solution to the Burundian problems.
</P>
<P>
Nzo expressed support for former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere's efforts to bring about peace in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government calls on all parties involved in
the Burundian conflict to exercise maximum restraint, and to
demonstrate a real commitment to bringing about lasting national
reconciliation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress also condemned the
unconstitutional take-over of power, saying a military coup
d'etat could never substitute the rule of law and
democracy, it said.
</P>
<P>
Civil fightings between Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis have
reportedly claimed the lives of an estimated 150,000 people in
the past three years.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Proposes Extension of Peace Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended to the Security Council that
the mandate of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) be
extended until January 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here today, Boutros-Ghali said that he
made the suggestion "in view of the importance of its contribution
to stability and the measure of protection it is able to afford to
the civilian population."
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the events of last April, these considerations
are, I believe, still valid, bearing in mind the likely effect in
the area if UNIFIL were to be withdrawn in present circumstances,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL was set up in March 1978 with the mandate to confirm
the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, to restore
international peace and security and to assist the government of
Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the
area.
</P>
<P>
But for years, the mission has been unable to fulfill its
mandate.
</P>
<P>
"UNIFIL is now stationed in an area where active resistance
against Israeli Defense Force is in progress, and in which the
latter is engaged in active countermeasures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"UNIFIL, for obvious reasons, has no right to impede Lebanese
acts of resistance against the occupying force, nor does it have
the mandate or the means to prevent countermeasures."
</P>
<P>
In the circumstances, Boutros-Ghali said, the UNIFIL has done
its best to limit violence and to protect the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
"This has become its de facto mandate. In pursuing it, the
Force had in fact impeded both sides from pursuing their military
aims in the conflict, but only to the extent that the parties have
permitted it to do so, out of a presumed desire to avoid
escalation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali also drew attention of the council to the serious
shortfall in the funding of the mission.
</P>
<P>
"At present, unpaid assessments amount to some 201.9 million
U.S. dollars. This represents money owed to members states that
contribute the troops who make up the force," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all member states to pay their assessments
promptly and in full and to clear all remaining arrears," he said.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1996, the UNIFIL comprised 4,483 troops, from Fiji,
Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cyclist Captures Gold at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclist Andrea Collinelli
captured the gold medal in men's individual pursuit here today,
after twice shattering the world record in the early rounds of
competition at the 26th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I suffered a lot and worked a lot," Collinelli said. "This
medal is the crowning of a career, but it can also be the
beginning of something."
</P>
<P>
Collinelli clocked a time of four minutes and 20.893 seconds in
the final to take his first Olympic medal in the four kilometer
event.
</P>
<P>
At press conference following the medal ceremony, he said he
cried so much before the ceremony that when he arrived at the
podium the emotion was almost gone.
</P>
<P>
"After two kilometers when I knew I was ahead, I knew I was
going to make it," Collinelli said.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Ermenault of France received the silver medal,
finishing in 4:22.714 in the final. Bradley McGee of Australia won
the bronze medal for clocking the third fastest time of 4:26.121
in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"At the finish line I was very disappointed because I didn't
win," said Ermenault through an interpreter. "When I reached the
podium I was happy because I knew I had won the silver."
</P>
<P>
Collinelli, 27, was a silver medalist at the 1995 World
Championships in Bogota, Colombia. He posted the fastest time in
the qualification round, but lost the finals to British rider
Graeme Obree.
</P>
<P>
But this time, Collinelli did not let it happen again. He broke
Obree's three-year-old world record in the qualification round and
Obree was eliminated in the round.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Collinelli smashed his own world record of
4:19.699 with a time of 4:19.153, while overtaking Andriy Yatsenko
of Ukraine in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Collinelli started racing at the age of 11 and has been with
Italy's national team for eight years. But he did not came under
the limelight until 1987, when he and his teammates won a silver
medal in team pursuit at the Junior World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 he has been the Italy's top cyclist in individual
pursuit, winning the national championships in 1992, 1994 and
1995. He also won the individual pursuit at the 1995 World Cup in
Manchester, Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ermenault, also 27, was the fifth at the Barcelona Games with a
time of 4:28.838. His best performance was a fourth place at the
Bogota World Championships. But in this year's World Cup events,
he won the Busto Garolfo, Italy, individual pursuit and was second
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
"In Barcelona, I wanted to discover the Olympics," Ermenault
said. "After Barcelona, I wanted to medal in Atlanta. I did it."

<HEADLINE> UK Unveils 3-Point Plan on Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today that it will put forward a three-point plan for
international cooperation on fighting terrorism at a ministerial
meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing earlier today, British Home
Secretary Michael Howard said that he would present the proposals
to a G-7 meeting of foreign and interior ministers to be held in
Paris next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that the proposals include a framework for sharing
expertise in dealing with and preventing attacks, a U.N.
resolution against the planning, incitement or funding of
terrorist acts, and a strengthening of anti-terrorist legislation
around the world.
</P>
<P>
"I want to focus next Tuesday's meeting to be about practical
measures which will enable countries to cope with the threat of
terrorism more effectively," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all countries to publish their skills in
dealing with what they consider to be terrorism and create a
directory of expertise.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary made it clear that Britain will propose a
United Nations resolution which stipulates that the planning,
incitement or funding of terrorist acts are against the principles
of the international organization.
</P>
<P>
"The significance of this is if an action is contrary to the
principles and purposes of the U.N., then someone engaged in it is
not entitled to the U.N. convention on refugees and not entitled
to political asylum," he added.
