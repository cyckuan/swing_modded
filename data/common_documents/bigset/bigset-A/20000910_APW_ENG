<HEADLINE> Revolution 4, MetroStars 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Midfielder Joe Franchino scored his first
two goals of the season as the New England Revolution beat Eastern
Division champions New York-New Jersey MetroStars 4-3 on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Franchino's second goal of the match at 67:17 proved to be the
winner, offsetting a three-goal performance by the MetroStars' Alex
Comas.
</P>
<P>
   New England finished the season with a 13-13-6 record, and a
franchise-best 45 points. The MetroStars concluded the season at
17-12-3 for 54 points.
</P>
<P>
   Comas scored two goals within a 19-minute mark of the first half
to put the MetroStars ahead. His third goal at 36:03 tied the match
at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   New England gained a 1-0 lead when Imad Baba converted his
fourth penalty kick chance at 5:27, scoring his ninth goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Comas tied the match 1-1 at 14:24, when he intercepted a
crossing pass by New England defender John Harkes. He then scored
his 8th goal of the season at 33:12, one-timing a high bouncing
volley from Steve Jolley.
</P>
<P>
   Franchino tied the match at 35:22. Jamar Beasley regained the
lead for New England at 39:56 with his third goal of the season, a
12-yard shot up the left wing to the far right post.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars' Clint Mathis, the third-leading goal scorer in
MLS with 16 goals, misfired on a penalty shot wide left at the
9-minute mark. He then had a point-blank shot into an empty net,
knocked off the goal line by Harkes at the 20-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   Comas then tied the score at 3-3 early in the second half with a
booming 16-yard shot.

<HEADLINE> Auburn 35, No. 19 Mississippi 27  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH D. RUSSO
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Rudi Johnson ran for 165 yards and two
touchdowns as Auburn beat No. 19 Mississippi 35-27 on Saturday
night, giving Tigers coach Tommy Tuberville a victory over his
former team.
</P>
<P>
   Deuce McAllister had 257 all-purpose yards and scored three
touchdowns, including an 87-yard punt return that gave Ole Miss
(1-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) a 27-21 lead in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Auburn (2-0, 1-0 SEC) answered McAllister's speed with
Johnson's power in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On a fourth-and-2 play, Johnson broke through the left side of a
tightly packed Ole Miss line and rumbled 42 yards for a touchdown
that gave the Tigers a 28-27 with 13:59 to go.
</P>
<P>
   After an interception by Courtney Rose with 8:02 left, Auburn
put together a 37-yard drive that took 6:21 and ended with Ben
Leard sneaking into the end zone from a yard out.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Simmons' diving interception with 1:27 left to play
sealed the victory. It was the third interception thrown by Romaro
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd of 52,368 packed into Vaught-Hemingway Stadium,
most hoping to see the Rebels give a rude welcome to their former
coach.
</P>
<P>
   But as the game ended the Auburn players raised Tuberville onto
their shoulders as the crowd loudly booed the coach who they feel
abandoned Ole Miss when he abruptly left after the 1998 regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson became the first Auburn runner since Stephen Davis in
1995 to have back-to-back 100-yard games.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, led by Johnson and fullback Heath Evans, jumped out a
21-7 with 9:16 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister ran for 103 yards on 18 carries.
</P>
<P>
   His first touchdown was a 26-yard burst up the middle at 7:39 of
the second quarter that made it 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister completed the Rebels' opening drive of the second
half by leaping over the line from about a foot out on
fourth-and-goal. But Les Binkley missed the extra point, the first
missed PAT of his career in 46 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister gave the Rebels the lead with his next touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He fielded Damon Duval's punt at the Rebels' 13, sidestepped a
tackler, then raced through a seam in Auburn's coverage untouched,
outrunning Duval for an 87-yard return. The score gave the Rebels a
27-21 lead at 4:53 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss has lost eight straight Southeastern Conference
openers.

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Fla. Beats Middle Tenn. 55-0  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Spurrier expects perfection from
his quarterback. When he doesn't get it, he doesn't hesitate to
make a change.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Palmer became the latest Florida starter to get the quick
hook Saturday night, lasting less than one half in the
eighth-ranked Gators' 55-0 rout of Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   If or when he will get another chance is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Although backup Rex Grossman, who threw three touchdown passes,
is not sure he did enough to take the No. 1 job, Spurrier wouldn't
say what he's thinking with Florida opening its Southeastern
Conference schedule next week at No. 12 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesse was not all that bad. I just thought Rex deserved a
chance,'' Spurrier said, adding that next week's starter will be
''whoever gives us the best chance to win. This week, it was
Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman replaced Palmer in the middle of a series with his team
leading 24-0, but Spurrier unhappy with the way the senior was
throwing and moving the offense. Palmer overthrew two receivers on
potential big plays and failed to spot an open receiver just before
being yanked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm used to it,'' Palmer said of the brewing controversy.
''It's totally up to the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman threw TD passes of 19 and 14 yards to Aaron Walker, as
well as a 16-yarder to Alex Willis that finished a seven-play,
50-yard drive that Palmer began with a 13-yard completion to Reche
Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (2-0) also scored on Earnest Graham's 4-yard run, which
capped a 96-yard drive Palmer directed in the first quarter. Lito
Sheppard returned a punt 54 yards for a touchdown, and Todd Johnson
scooped up a fumble and ran 76 yards for a fourth-quarter score.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Tennessee (0-2) never threatened, finishing with 229
yards and five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite amassing 495 yards total offense in its season opener,
Spurrier was not happy with Florida's sloppy play in a 21-point
victory over Ball State. Palmer led touchdown drives on the Gators'
first two possessions this time, but didn't build on that success.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman threw his TD pass to Willis, after replacing Palmer
with four minutes left in the second quarter. He threw the first of
his two scoring passes to Walker after a Middle Tennessee fumble,
giving Florida a 38-0 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams returned to the field for the second half, Palmer
sat on a bench behind most of his teammates while Grossman and true
freshman Brock Berlin warmed up to play the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 15 of 23 passes for 193 yards and one
touchdown, a 17-yard throw to Taylor Jacobs on the sixth play of
the game. Grossman finished 9-of-14 for 95 yards and one
interception, while Berlin was 2-of-4 for 11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to think I was kind of tough under the pressure,''
said Grossman, who nevertheless wouldn't lay claim to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's up to coach Spurrier. ... I don't know if I'm in a
position to start this game (Tennessee). I don't think Jesse played
that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle Tennessee is working through a quarterback dilemma of its
own, with Wes Counts and Jason Johnson once again splitting playing
time. Neither had much success against the Florida defense, which
recovered four fumbles and didn't allow the Blue Raiders to get
anywhere close to scoring range.
</P>
<P>
   Counts completed 7 of 16 passes for 58 yards, while Johnson was
10-for-16 for 81 yards and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Raiders trailed No. 21 Illinois 7-6 at the half before
losing 35-6 last week. Florida never gave them a chance to build
confidence Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out and corrected their mistakes from their first
game ... We tried to hang in, but we couldn't,'' coach Andy
McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can do some different things against strength, but when
you face speed there is not too much you can do against it,''
Counts said. ''Hopefully we can learn from certain things that will
make us better for later down the road for teams that aren't as
good as Florida.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies 6, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe the New York Mets should put up calendars
in the clubhouse that say: ''August.'' They certainly have trouble
with September.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell allowed a pair of seventh-inning runs to put
Philadelphia ahead to stay, then threw his glove into the stands in
disgust as the Mets lost meekly again, 6-3 to the Phillies on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which seemed a lock for the playoffs 10 days ago, is
1-7 in September and saw its wild card lead cut to 3&AMP;frac12; games over
Arizona. On Friday night, it was Mike Hampton who lost his cool,
throwing a dugout temper tantrum when he came out of a 2-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   This time Wendell threw a fit as former-Met Robert Person (8-5)
and five relievers combined on a six-hitter, sending New York to
its 15th loss in 17 September games dating to last year.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile lost his cool, too, on his 35th birthday, drawing a
line in the dirt with his bat for plate umpire Travis Katzenmeier,
who called him out on strikes in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo, with just eight errors coming in, helped the
Phillies by missing a pair of grounders in the seventh. The crowd
of 42,324 turned on New York, booing the sloppy display.
</P>
<P>
   Since pounding the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson on Aug. 25, the
Mets have just 34 runs in 13 games and are hitting .198
(81-for-409).
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza is batting .278 (10-for-36) with a pair of solo
homers for his only RBIs in that span. Alfonzo is hitting .238
(10-for-42) with five RBIs, Zeile .111 (4-for-36) with three RBIs
and Robin Ventura is .070 (3-for-43) with two RBIs, going hitless
in his last 22 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia came to New York with the worst record in the major
leagues, losers of eight straight, scoring 16 runs in the skid.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets scored just two runs in the first two games of the
series, reminiscent of the 1998 skid that caused them to miss the
playoffs and the one last year that nearly cost them a postseason
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Person improved to 3-0 against the Mets in his career, allowing
one run and three hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burrell's RBI double put the Phillies ahead in the sixth,
ending Glendon Rusch's scoreless streak at 16 innings, but Alfonzo
doubled home a run in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell (7-5) relieved to start the seventh and allowed
pinch-hitter Travis Lee's single past shortstop leading off.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu then hit a hard grounder to second that Alfonzo
should have turned into a double play, but the ball skipped past
him -- it was originally called an error, then changed to a hit --
putting runners on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville followed with a go-ahead sacrifice fly, with Lee
just beating Piazza's tag at the plate following Timoniel Perez's
strong throw from center.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Scott Rolen, Burrell lined an RBI
single over Alfonzo. Wendell faced one more batter, retiring Brian
Hunter on a foul pop, then was taken out.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he tossed his glove over the Mets' dugout as he
walked off the field. On Friday night, Hampton threw his glove and
punched water coolers when he came out after allowing Rolen's
two-run, eighth-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell homered off Vicente Padilla with two outs in the
eighth, but Brian Hunter hit a three-run homer off Armando Benitez
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani homered in the bottom half off Jeff Brantley.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Philadelphia LHP Tom Jacquez made his major league debut in
the seventh, retiring his only two batters. ... The Phillies aren't
hitting much better than the Mets. They were batting .186 in their
previous nine games (54-for-291) before getting 13 hits Saturday.
... Bell made a leaping catch against the right-field fence on
Burrell's drive in the fourth. The ball probably would have hit the
top of the fence. ... Burrell slipped on wet grass rounding third
in the sixth and had to hold up, costing Philadelphia a run.

<HEADLINE> No. 20 Oklahoma Beats Ark. St. 45-7  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Through the air, on the ground and with
special teams, No. 20 Oklahoma beat Arkansas State every which way
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Heupel threw three touchdown passes, J.T. Thatcher returned
a punt 66 yards for a score on his way to a school record for
returns, and freshman Renaldo Works ran for 109 yards in a 45-7
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also contributed, holding Jonathan Adams to 43 yards
on 12 carries one week after he gained 137 in a double-overtime
loss to North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot to improve on,'' said Oklahoma coach Bob
Stoops, whose team has next week off. ''We can sit now and analyze
these two games, what we need to do, what's been good and bad and
really emphasize improvement. We need to make some improvement this
week in many areas, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners (2-0) were penalized 11 times for 95 yards, but it
hardly mattered. Arkansas State (0-2) didn't cross midfield until
late in the second quarter while falling behind 28-0. And the
Indians were penalized 14 times themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they'll be tested when they play against a better
football team,'' Arkansas State coach Joe Hollis said of the
Sooners, who have outscored their two opponents 100-21. ''They were
better, they were more athletic and they had more team speed.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Heupel's touchdowns came on third-and-long plays,
including two in the first half. His 35 career TD passes,
accomplished in 13 games, tied the school record set by Cale Gundy
in 40 games from 1990-93.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher had 160 yards on five returns, breaking the Oklahoma
record of 146 yards set last season by Jarrail Jackson against
Missouri. Thatcher also had an interception that set up a
third-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''J.T. got a game ball for defense and offense,'' Stoops said.
''He really played well in both parts of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good in that we made a lot of improvement in the
kicking game from a week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Heupel was 24-of-32 for 301 yards and, thanks to a 75-yard
touchdown run by Works in the fourth quarter, the Sooners topped
200 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's longest drive of the night was its first, an
80-yarder that Heupel capped with a 1-yard sneak.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher then scored on his punt return, taking the ball right
up the middle before cutting to the outside and outrunning the
Indians to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a middle call and I saw I had to make one guy miss, so
I made him miss,'' Thatcher said. ''I went to the outside and saw
the sidelines and just went to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   A 30-yard return by Thatcher and a personal foul against the
Indians set Oklahoma up at the Arkansas State 42 late in the first
quarter. The Sooners quickly drove inside the 10, but two penalties
left them with third-and-goal from the 26.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be no problem for Heupel. On the first play of
the second quarter, he hit Damien Mackey deep along the left
sideline. Mackey ran through a defender near the goal line for
Oklahoma's third touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners made it 28-0 when Heupel, given plenty of time,
found Andre Woolfolk in the back of the end zone for a 19-yard
touchdown on third-and-8. The drive began after a 40-yard Thatcher
return.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel and Woolfolk collaborated on a touchdown again in the
third quarter, this time a 35-yarder on third-and-11. A 14-yard
return by Thatcher had set the Sooners up at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Woolfolk finished with 102 yards on five catches.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State's only touchdown came on a 33-yard run by Danny
Smith in the second quarter. Robert Kilow had 108 yards on 10
receptions for the Indians.

<HEADLINE> No. 16 UCLA Beats Fresno St. 24-21  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An obviously upset UCLA coach Bob Toledo
insisted the 16th-ranked Bruins didn't suffer a letdown against
Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Performance, especially at the quarterback position, was the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   DeShaun Foster ran for two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and the
No. 16 Bruins withstood two late scoring passes from David Carr to
Charles Smith for a 24-21 victory over the Bulldogs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're 2-0, but I am very concerned,'' Toledo said. ''We have
to get a better performance from our quarterback position to be
successful. We have to pick up blitzes, we have to see guys open,
we need to get better fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who beat then-No. 3 Alabama 35-24 in their opener,
face current No. 3 Michigan next Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who the quarterback will be, Ryan McCann or Scott
McEwan, Toledo replied: ''I don't know, I've got to think about it.
We'll talk about it Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Cory Paus separated his throwing shoulder
on the first play of the Alabama game and will be sidelined for at
least two more weeks. McCann was effective against the Crimson
Tide, but not against Fresno State, at least in the view of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   McCann threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Mitchell in the
first quarter, but was relieved by McEwan after completing 12 of 23
passes for only 106 yards in the first half. McEwan was 5-of-10 for
29 yards while playing the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no rhythm in the first half, we had no consistency,''
Toledo said. ''That's why I made the change. I gave Scott the
chance, and he did a nice job.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo gave Fresno State credit for giving his team a difficult
time, but added firmly, ''We did not execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster scored on a 1-yard run on fourth-and-goal with 11:16
remaining, and a 49-yard burst less than 2&AMP;frac12; minutes later to give
the Bruins what appeared to be an insurmountable 24-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carr threw scoring passes of 16 and 32 yards to Smith
to make it a three-point game with five minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (0-2) got the ball back with 2:39 left at their own
34, and moved to the UCLA 43 before Carr fumbled a snap from center
and Marques Anderson recovered with 1:17 remaining for the game's
only turnover. The Bruins then ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't even think about the snap, the fumble just
happened,'' Carr said. ''I would have ripped my arm off to get it
back. But it didn't happen. I don't think we ran out of time, we
could have and should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were given all they could handle by Fresno State, a
14-point underdog. The Bulldogs finished with 275 yards of total
offense to 270 for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard when you work this hard and lose,'' Fresno State
coach Pat Hill said. ''We've had a lot of games like this. This is
not a moral victory, I'm only interested in wins. We had control of
this game. When we got down, a lot of teams would have quit. We
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who gained a career-high 187 yards on a school
record-tying 42 carries against Alabama, picked up 140 yards on 29
attempts. He had only 48 yards on 15 carries in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Carr completed 20 of 33 passes for 249 yards and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great game until the fourth quarter,'' UCLA
quarterback Ricky Manning Jr., who is from Fresno, said of the
Bruins' defense. ''We were not surprised by the way they played.
The emotion didn't decide the game, it was execution. The team that
played the better football won this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got off to a disastrous start. After failing to get a
first down on the opening series, punter Nate Fikse was unable to
handle the snap from Jeff Grau and lost 23 yards to the UCLA 6.
Three plays later, Carr threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to freshman
Alec Greco to give the Bulldogs a quick lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins then moved 83 yards to tie the game on the
McCann-to-Mitchell pass. The Bulldogs helped out greatly by
committing three personal fouls on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State was penalized 10 times for 116 yards overall,
prompting Hill to say: ''I'm not going to complain about the
penalties. You saw the same game I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams blew scoring chances in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith returned a punt 75 yards to the UCLA 7, but tripped in the
open field to keep him from scoring. Then, James Tillman was held
to no gain on a fourth down running play from the 2.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his foot barely brushed a teammate, causing him to
take an odd step and fall.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA drove to the Bulldogs' 13 immediately thereafter, but
Foster was held to no gain on a fourth-and-1 play.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played before a crowd of 45,605 at the Rose Bowl,
where 76,640 watched the Alabama-UCLA game.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Fla. State 26, Ga. Tech 21  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Florida State was about to see its hopes of
winning another national title fall apart in the second week of the
season. But Chris Weinke didn't come back to school to let that
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old senior threw for a career-high 443 yards and a
couple of touchdowns as the No. 2 Seminoles escaped a major upset
by holding off Georgia Tech 26-21 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (2-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) extended its
winning streak to 14 in a row and improved its conference record to
63-2 since joining the ACC in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (1-1), a 22-point underdog, lost its ninth in a row
to the Seminoles but received a rousing cheer from the home fans
after its final drive ended in Florida State territory.
</P>
<P>
   After passing up a chance to enter the NFL draft, Weinke became
Florida State's career-leading passer with 6,433 yards. He was
25-of-38 against Tech, including a 30-yard touchdown pass to Robert
Morgan with 12:58 remaining that put the Seminoles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who hooked up with Javon Walker on a 68-yard TD in the
first quarter, drove the Seminoles to another score on William
McCray's 1-yard run with 7:45 to go.
</P>
<P>
   George Godsey, who shared the quarterback duties with Jermaine
Crenshaw, capitalized on a roughing the passer penalty to thrown a
27-yard TD to Jon Muyres with 4:50 left. Tech stopped the Seminoles
and faced fourth-and-3 at the FSU 40.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey attempted a pass across the middle to Kerry Watkins, who
appeared to be hit early by Stanford Samuels. But the officials
didn't throw a flag and Florida State ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, which lost to Florida State 41-35 last year with
Heisman Trophy runner-up Joe Hamilton at quarterback, used both
Godsey and Crenshaw to keep things close once again.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, a third-year sophomore playing his first game at that
position, was rotating with Godsey on just about every play in the
third quarter, a system that confused the Seminoles and led to a
13-play, 63-yard scoring drive. Joe Burns went over on an 8-yard
run and Tech led 15-12 after a 2-point conversion with 3:17
remaining in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey ran the team through most of the fourth quarter,
completing 13 straight passes and finishing 18-of-32 for 189 yards.
Crenshaw was 4-of-5 for 30 yards and led the team in rushing with
36 yards on nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke easily broke his previous career high, a 354-yard
performance at Wake Forest last year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State dominated statistically in a penalty filled game,
outgaining the Yellow Jackets 536-298. Yellow was the predominate
color of the night, as Tech was penalized 19 times for a
school-record 140 yards and Florida State 15 times for 114 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top two teams both survived close calls. No. 1
Nebraska won at Notre Dame earlier in the day, 27-24 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The game started with all the makings of a Florida State rout.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles drove 73 yards on their first possession before
stalling at the Georgia Tech 4, settling for Chance Gwaltney's
21-yard field goal. Florida State went all the way to the end zone
the next time it got the ball, as Weinke hooked up with Walker on
the 63-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Walker got behind safety Jeremy Muyres, who would have been
called for interference except that the receiver still managed to
catch the ball and hobble across the goal line after spraining his
right ankle on the play.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Seminoles defense got in on the scoring.
Godsey was sacked in the end zone by Jamal Reynolds to push Florida
State to a 12-0 lead with 3:03 still remaining in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets had been outgained 200-0 when Crenshaw,
listed as the third-team quarterback, went in late in the first
quarter. He ran for 15 yards on his first play and gave his team a
spark of life.
</P>
<P>
   But Tech's biggest play was provided by the defense, which took
advantage of Florida State's decision to give Weinke a breather.
Backup quarterback Marcus Outzen tried a pass along the left
sideline and Marvious Hester stepped in for the interception,
returning it 50 yards for a touchdown with 9:04 left in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the Yellow Jackets went to locker room trailing only
12-7 even though they been outgained 318-104 in total yardage.

<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Caffe Latte, the Irish-bred daughter of
Seattle Dancer ridden by Brice Blanc, rallied from nearly last
place to win the $400,000 Ramona Handicap by 1&AMP;frac14; lengths on turf in

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- On a night of individual achievement, Chris
Weinke was concerned with only two numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State 26, Georgia Tech 21.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who came back to school in hopes of leading Florida
State to another national title, threw for a career-high 443 yards
and two touchdowns as the No. 2 Seminoles escaped a major upset
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old senior also became Florida State's
career-leading passer with 6,433 yards, passing both Danny Kanell
and Gary Huff.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an individual game,'' Weinke said. ''I didn't even
know it. I was so focused on the game and getting us a win. It's a
great honor when you look at some of the great quarterbacks who
have played at Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (2-0, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) extended its
winning streak to 14 in a row and improved its conference record to
63-2 since joining the ACC in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (1-1, 0-1), a 22-point underdog, lost its ninth in
a row to the Seminoles but received a rousing cheer from the home
fans after its final drive ended in Florida State territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tech just would not quit,'' FSU coach Bobby Bowden said.
''What were our problems? Georgia Tech, they were our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After passing up a chance to enter the NFL draft, Weinke had the
best game of his career. He was 25-of-38, including a 30-yard
touchdown pass to Robert Morgan with 12:58 remaining that put the
Seminoles ahead 19-15.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who hooked up with Javon Walker on a 63-yard TD in the
first quarter, drove the Seminoles to another score in the fourth
quarter, completing three passes for 87 yards before William McCray
ran in from the 1 with 7:45 to go.
</P>

   George Godsey, who shared the quarterback duties with Jermaine
Crenshaw, capitalized on a roughing the passer penalty to throw a
27-yard TD to Jon Muyres with 4:50 left. Tech stopped the Seminoles

   Godsey attempted a pass across the middle to Kerry Watkins, who
appeared to be hit early by Stanford Samuels. But the officials
didn't throw a flag and Florida State ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our true character showed,'' Weinke said. ''It's early in the
season. I think we will be fine. This was a true test. But we need
to get the killer instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, which lost to Florida State 41-35 last year with
Heisman Trophy runner-up Joe Hamilton at quarterback, used both
Godsey and Crenshaw to keep things close once again.

<P>
   ''We had them on their toes and should have thrown the knockout
punch,'' Tech defensive end Greg Gathers said. ''But I give Florida
State credit. They came back when they had to.''
</P>

   Godsey ran the team through most of the fourth quarter,

<HEADLINE> Forest Chief: Focus on Wilderness  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck said his
agency should be at the forefront of preserving what's left of the
nation's pristine countryside and he recommended increasing the
number of Forest Service employees working on wilderness issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five percent of our land area is wilderness. It might not
sound like much, and it isn't. It's not nearly enough,'' Dombeck
said Saturday at a national conference on wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal agencies need more information on land that
could qualify for federal wilderness designation and must do more
to cooperate on its management.
</P>
<P>
   The message was a big hit at the Wilderness 2000 conference,
sponsored by The Wilderness Society and other environmental groups.
So was the messenger, who got a standing ovation at the end of his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Since his appointment in late 1996, Dombeck, a fisheries
biologist, has emphasized forest health over livestock grazing and
logging. He has proposed banning roads in 43 million acres of
roadless national forest land.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, now under review, would be done administratively, and
has prompted critics to complain the Clinton administration is
doing an end-run around Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck said current roads won't be closed, and people will
still be able to use the roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Forest Service endorses multiple uses of public
land, Dombeck said his agency also needs to promote preservation of
wilderness. That includes proposing new spots for federal
wilderness designation and ensuring the lands are managed
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Act of 1964 prohibits motorized vehicles, logging
and other activities in federal wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1964, the amount of wilderness has grown from 9 million to
105 million acres, Dombeck said. There about 650 wilderness areas
in 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in spite of the many gains, I remain concerned about the
future,'' Dombeck said. ''We can turn a wilderness into timberland.
We can turn timberland into farmland. We can turn farmland into
shopping malls. But we can't create wilderness.''

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Official To Visit Seoul  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A high-ranking North Korean official
will visit Seoul this week to discuss inter-Korean issues, the
office of President Kim Dae-jung said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun will arrive in Seoul Monday for a four-day visit as
a special envoy for North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun will call on South Korean President Kim Dae-jung,
meet other southern officials and visit Cheju, an island south of
the Korean peninsula, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun, a close confidant of Kim Jong Il, heads the
Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles southern investment in
the North and promotes exchanges with nations that have no
diplomatic ties with the North.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il had promised to send Kim Yong Sun to discuss his
visit to the South Korean capital in return for President Kim
Dae-jung's visit to Pyongyang in June.
</P>
<P>
   At the June summit, the two Korean leaders pledged to promote
peace on the Korean peninsula and seek an eventual unification.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
democratic South in 1945. The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an
armistice, not a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Boy Saves Sister From Swarming Bees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- An 11-year-old boy is credited with
saving his little sister from swarming yellow jackets that stung
her at least 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Bell, 7, was camping with her family in Michigan last
month when she slipped down a ravine and landed on a hive of bees.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bell pulled his sister to a nearby river, put her in the
water and brushed off the bees. He was stung 15 times himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just an instinct,'' he said. ''I couldn't just leave
her there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-grader said his idea to jump in the river came from a
science lesson at school last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew if bees got their wings wet they couldn't fly,'' he
said. ''I thought the best thing to do was to get in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, who spent two days in a hospital, continues to recover.

<HEADLINE> $214M Insurance Settlement Approved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge has approved a $214
million settlement of a class-action lawsuit claiming American
General Life and Accident Insurance Co. overcharged black and
low-income policyholders for burial insurance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge John Nixon on Friday also approved a
prosecutors' request for $24.1 million in fees and another $500,000
for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville-based American General Life and Accident agreed to the
settlement in June. The settlement covers some 9.1 million black
and white policyholders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the policies were sold by companies American General
Life and Accident acquired over the years. Customers will be
compensated at least $150 for each policy and may receive
additional benefits, including premium reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Similar discrimination suits are pending against other insurance
companies, including Prudential Insurance Co. of America and
MetLife.
</P>
<P>
   American General Life and Accident also has agreed to a $1.2
million regulatory settlement with Florida's insurance regulator,
which led the investigation of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in 33 other states will split another $5.8 million.

OPEC Nations Back Boost in Oil Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Members of the petroleum producers' cartel said
Saturday they supported raising their official output by at least half a million
barrels a day as international pressure mounts on OPEC to pump more oil to stem
surging fuel prices. Oil ministers from Iran and Algeria said they would back an
increase of 500,000 barrels a day -- or 2 percent above OPEC's current
production -- when they meet with their counterparts at a crucial meeting Sunday
in the Austrian capital. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's biggest producer and its only
member with significant spare capacity to pump new oil.

   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- John Burris, the heavily favored state House
majority leader, narrowly beat retired judge Bill Lee in Delaware's GOP
gubernatorial primary by 44 votes, according to preliminary totals Saturday
night. The Delaware Department of Elections reported Burris had 13,887 votes to
Lee's 13,843. The tiny Middle Atlantic state has nearly 169,000 registered
Republicans. Lee, who had conducted a grass-roots campaign and got his name on
the ballot to the surprise of party leaders, refused to concede the primary
Saturday night. Burris is expected to face Democratic Lt. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner

French Truckers Lifting Blockades

<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French truckers began lifting nationwide blockades at oil
refineries and fuel depots Saturday after union leaders unanimously called for
an end to a six-day protest that has strangled fuel supplies, causing airport
delays and chaos at gas stations. With a majority of France's gas stations still
dry, however, the removal of blockades was not expected to ease immediately the
plight of motorists, who have had to line up bumper-to-bumper to fill their
tanks. The Interior Ministry said 30 oil refineries and fuel depots were still
blocked as of Saturday evening, compared with more than 100 earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 celebrate end of U.N. Millennium Summit  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - More than 5,000 people celebrated the end of the
U.N. Millennium Summit Saturday night at a multi-cultural show for
''Peace, Health and Prosperity,'' featuring a Chinese acrobat
balancing parasols, American musical and soul singers and Filipino
dancers imitating the movements of birds and fish.
</P>
<P>
   The audiences at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden
included President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of Congo -
one of more than 150 world leaders who attended the three-day
summit, which ended Friday - and China's U.S. ambassador, Li
Zhaoxing
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to spell love and peace - you can't find two
better words,'' American soul singer Ella Mitchell said to applause
after belting out two numbers, ''Oh, Brother'' and ''Peaceful
Waters.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience was treated to a cultural smorgasbord reflecting
the diversity of the summit's participants.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Flamenco dancer Andrea del Conte strutted with
castanets. American tap dancer Tarik Winston spun across the stage
on his toes and landed in a split. Chinese musician Chi Li
performed on the erhu, a traditional instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Belly dancers silenced the crowd with their seductive movements.
The Qi Shu Fang Peking Opera Company in traditional costumes
performed breathtaking swordplay.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Covington, a 17-year-old American best known for her
appearances in the 20th anniversary tour of the musical ''Evita,''
sang ''The Greatest Love of All'' with Gilles Chiasson, who was in
the original cast of ''Rent'' and national tours of ''Les
Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience also saw the world premiere of Homeland, a
Mongolian dance portraying the affection and connection between
people and Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Native American Cliff Mathias, of the Redhawk Indian Arts
Council, performed a dance using hoops, leaping through them and
swirling them in the air. As a finale, he formed a globe with the
rings and held it over his head.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration was organized and sponsored by more than 200
American and Canadian societies and multinational arts ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Yun Sun, who served as the event's executive director,
said the show brought international artists together to show
support for the world leaders, who adopted a declaration setting
out a blueprint for the 21st century to help end poverty and war.

<HEADLINE> Flood in Italy Kills at Least Six  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A rain-swollen stream flooded a campground in the
southern region of Calabria before dawn Sunday, killing at least
six disabled campers and injuring dozens as they slept, authorities
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The flood turned Le Giare campground near the seaside town of
Soverato into a sea of mud, with cars overturned and pushed up
against trees, footage on private TV Canale 5 showed.
</P>
<P>
   RAI state TV reported that about 10 people were missing hours
after the flood. As many as 20 campers apparently had left the
campground only hours before the flood, possibly discouraged by two
days of pounding rain, Italian news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why the others had decided to stay in the
campground despite the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, the body of a man, apparently the victim
of the bad weather, was found elsewhere in Calabria along a beach,
Italian news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense authorities in Rome said that at least six people
died in the flood and 44 others were hospitalized for injuries.
None of the injuries was life-threatening, with most people being
treated for exposure to the cold water, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
   RAI said all the dead were disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 people, including disabled campers and volunteers caring
for them, were staying at the campground close to the town of
Soverato near the Ionian Sea when the stream poured over its banks.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of intense heat and no rain, storms started pounding
much of southern Italy a couple of days earlier, isolating dozens
of hamlets near the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In the seaside town of Roccella, about a hundred houses were
evacuated Saturday night, with families going to sleep with
relatives or friends elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ANSA said floodwaters swept away more than 100 unoccupied
vehicles in various seaside towns in Calabria, with some of the
cars winding up a quarter mile away on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Rail travel in the region, including along the route connecting
Taranto in Puglia with Reggio Calabria, was interrupted, and a
heavily used state highway in the region forming the ''toe'' of the
Italian peninsula was impassable in some points.

<HEADLINE> Spain Bomb Blast Damages Disco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEBA, Spain (AP) -- A bomb damaged a discotheque in Spain's
northern Basque region Sunday in an attack claimed by Basque
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the explosion shortly before 11 a.m., but
police said the bomb caused extensive damage to the Txitxarro
discotheque in the town of Deba, some 15 miles west of coastal city
of San Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   Basque police said a man identifying himself as a member of the
Basque armed group ETA warned of an imminent explosion at the
disco.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous caller also said that two people who were cleaning
inside the discotheque had been left handcuffed to a tree in the
road of Itziar toward Hendaya.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a hunter found a man and a woman tied to a
tree and reported it to police. The two confirmed that there were
no other people inside the discotheque at the time of the
explosion, which mainly damaged the building's roof.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Deba, Jesus Maria Aguirrezabala, said that the
target of the blast was the owner of the disco, Narciso Korta, who
is a brother of a businessmen killed in a car bomb in August. ETA
has claimed responsibility for that bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ETA regularly targets the Basque business community as part of
its independence campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A series of attacks by ETA in the last two months are seen as an
acceleration of the campaign of the armed group. It has been blamed
for about a dozen killings this year since it ended a 14-month
truce last December.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 people have been killed since ETA started its
campaign for independence 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque
provinces in the north. It envisions an independent state that
would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural
identity and language. For some, ETA's fight is a legitimate battle
for sovereignty. But the majority of Spaniards oppose their goals,
pointing out that under Spain's democratic constitution, the
Basques enjoy more autonomy than any other region in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe government dismisses U.S. lawsuit against Mugabe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) - A presidential spokesman on Sunday
dismissed a $400 million lawsuit filed against President Robert
Mugabe in New York as a ''nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit accuses Mugabe of orchestrating violence to
keep his ruling party in power and says he was responsible for
human rights abuses surrounding the June parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was served the case Thursday while in New York for the
U.N. Millennium Summit of world leaders. It was filed in Manhattan
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In Harare, Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba said the case
would not affect Mugabe at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a nonevent and (the plaintiffs) know it to be such,'' he
said. ''It was just meant to build a bit of a pretext around what
is patently a futile act.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Maria Stevens on Sunday said the case was filed on
behalf of all Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fighting this for our workers, for all victims, for all
13 million people in our country,'' said Stevens, whose husband -
an opposition activist - was killed, allgedly by ruling party
militants, in April.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a
211-year-old U.S. law that allows foreigners to file civil charges
in the United States for alleged crimes that violate international
law.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Adela Chiminya said authorities had done nothing to
capture those who beat and burned her husband to death in the
presence of police. Chiminya's husband was a youth organizer for
the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff and opposition parliamentarian Evelyn Masaiti
described how war veterans repeatedly beat her and attacked her
eastern Zimbabwe home, which the veterans had declared ''a no-go
area for opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Pfebve, also an opposition parliamentarian, describes
the fatal beating of his brother Matthew in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence ahead of the June elections left 31 people
dead and thousands homeless. Most of the victims were opposition
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest started in February, when veterans of the bush war
that ended white minority rule in 1980 started illegally occupying
white-owned farms. About 1,700 farms are now occupied in what
Mugabe has called a justified protest against unfair land
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   White descendants of mostly British and South African
colonial-era settlers own about a third of the nation's prime land,
where about 2 million farm workers and their family members live.
About 7.5 million people live on the other two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has announced that he will nationalize 3,041 white-owned
properties before November, when seasonal rains begin. The land is
to be distributed to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The state news agency, ZIANA, reported Sunday that 240,000 black
farm workers plan to sue Mugabe to demand compensation if the
properties of their 3,000 white employers are seized before
November.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest has plunged Zimbabwe's agriculture-based economy into
its worst crisis since independence. Inflation has soared to a
record 70 percent this year and unemployment has reached 50
percent.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton faces Tuesday primary; as does ''Grandpa Munster''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Before Hillary Rodham Clinton can truly
proclaim herself the Democratic Party's U.S. Senate candidate
against Rep. Rick Lazio, she must win a primary Tuesday against a
little-known physician from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And, ''Grandpa Munster'' is at it again. Cigar-chomping actor Al
Lewis, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York in 1998 as
the Green Party's candidate, faces a three-way primary for that
party's Senate nomination this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McMahon, a 39-year-old orthopedic surgeon, managed to force
Clinton into a primary by collecting the signatures of more than
40,000 Democrats across the state. He needed just 15,000. She got
on the ballot by being the unanimous choice of the Democratic state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   While McMahon has boasted of pulling off a primary upset, the
Clinton camp and the state's Democratic Party hierarchy, which is
solidly behind the first lady, have largely ignored the doctor's
challenge. McMahon has been met by sparse crowds as he tours the
state. Many of those who do show up wonder who he is.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, greeted like a celebrity at most stops, has
declined to debate him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're focused on the real debate in this race - the one
between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio,'' Clinton spokesman Howard
Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican until 1997, McMahon has stressed Clinton's lack of
New York roots and his familiarity with health care issues as
reasons to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would you rather have solving the problems of health care
- a doctor from New York or a lawyer from Arkansas?'' he asked
during a campaign stop outside the state Capitol on Thursday.

   New York pollster Lee Miringoff of Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion said Clinton should have little trouble sending
McMahon back to his medical practice and that the challenge won't
get much attention unless he approaches or breaks the 30 percent
mark. Even then, according to Miringoff, the results would mean
little given the expected low turnout for the state primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would reflect that there is some anti-Hillary stuff there,
which we already know,'' the independent pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll out Sunday, conducted for the New York Post by
Zogby International, had Clinton leading McMahon, 75 percent to 14
percent. The telephone poll of 703 likely voters was conducted
Thursday through Saturday and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party seemed to be taking no chances,
unveiling a radio ad to run on black-oriented radio stations in New
York City designed to increase turnout for Tuesday's primary. While
the ad doesn't mention the first lady, whose support is strongest
among black voters, it does mention her husband, who is even more
popular among black voters than she is.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 5 million enrolled Democrats in the state who
are eligible to vote in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Polls for the primary are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. in New
York, on Long Island and in Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Erie
counties. They are open from noon to 9 p.m. in the state's other 51
counties.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event that Clinton loses the Democratic primary,
she will remain on the November ballot as the candidate of the
state's Liberal and union-backed Working Families parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has no Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   There are other U.S. Senate primaries in New York on Tuesday,
including:
</P>
<P>
   -Actor-comedian-political activist Lewis, who played ''Grandpa''
in ''The Munsters'' television series, faces a three-way Green
Party primary against Ronnie Dugger, the founding editor of the
Texas Observer who has written biographies of both Lyndon Johnson
and Ronald Reagan; and Mark Dunau, an organic farmer. Results of
the Green Party primary may not be known for several days after the
vote because paper ballots are being used in New York City for that
race.
</P>
<P>
   -Former Watertown Mayor Jeff Graham faces Jeff Beller, an Albany
area advocate for renewable energy, in the battle for the
Independence Party nomination. It is the New York arm of the
national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   -Republican Louis Wein, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in
1990 on the Right to Life Party's line, is facing John Adefope, a
telephone company engineer, for the anti-abortion party's Senate
nomination.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Plead for Help  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) -- With little medicine and dwindling food
supplies, East Timorese refugees in squalid camps throughout
Indonesian West Timor pleaded Sunday for the return of
international aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. refugee agency operations head Bernard Kerblat said
that despite the extreme suffering of the refugees, aid workers
would not return to the territory until all pro-Indonesian militias
are disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 U.N. officials and other humanitarian workers fled
West Timor on Thursday after three of their foreign colleagues and
three civilians were slaughtered in a pro-Indonesian militia
rampage a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation meant the cutoff of food, medical and other aid
to about 90,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need aid,'' said Natalia Maria da Costa, as she cradled her
18-month-old baby in the hot and dusty Tuapukan camp on the
outskirts of the regional capital Kupang. ''The most important
thing is food for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   She said most refugees' food supplies would run out in about
three days and a promise of rice from Indonesia's government was
yet to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Indonesia's Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri said
she will soon send 100 tons of rice to the region, and local
officials in Kupang said they had enough food for the next six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said they were also facing an acute shortage of
medical supplies after an international relief organization's
medical clinic had closed.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 refugees fled their homes in East Timor for the
camps in the western half of the island a year ago after
pro-Indonesia militiamen went on a frenzy of destruction, a
reaction to East Timor's vote for independence from Indonesia in a
U.N.-sponsored ballot. West Timor remains an Indonesian territory.
</P>
<P>
   When international peacekeepers arrived in September 1999 to
restore order, the militiamen also fled to the west. With the
apparent backing of sections of Indonesia's military, they rule the
camps and use them as bases for attacks on U.N. peacekeepers in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the original refugees have since returned to East
Timor. Others remain, either wanting to stay or complaining that
militia gangs will kill them if they try to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
spokeswoman Ellen Hanson said Sunday that there were reports of
militia thugs scouring refugee camps in search of anyone associated
with the world body and other international relief agencies.

<HEADLINE> Colorful Ex-Lawmaker Critchley Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Outspoken former lawmaker Sir Julian Critchley,
who clashed with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over
Europe and eventually left the Conservative Party because he felt
it was too anti-European, has died, his son said Sunday. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Critchley said his father died in a hospital Saturday
morning. He had been suffering from bone and prostate cancer and
more recently been diagnosed with a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley, who had represented Aldershot in southern England for
the Conservative Party since 1964, quit Parliament before the last
national elections in 1997, which saw Tony Blair's Labor Party
sweep the Tories from power after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley openly confessed his disappointment at never achieving
ministerial rank. But as a keen supporter of European integration,
he was often at odds with then prime minister Thatcher's
euro-skeptic stance, describing her on one occasion as a ''great
she-elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he supported former defense secretary Michael
Heseltine's bid to wrest leadership of the Conservative Party from
Thatcher. Heseltine failed -- placing Critchley even more firmly on
the margins of power -- but the leadership contest fatally weakened
Thatcher and the party ousted her as prime minister and party
leader later that year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 elections for the European Parliament, Critchley's rift
with party bosses widened when he supported several unofficial,
pro-Europe Tory candidates. He left the party soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted in 1995 by Thatcher's successor, John Major.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley is survived by his wife, Heather, three daughters and
a son.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Barghouti Dies  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Bashir Barghouti, a minister in the first
Palestinian cabinet and a veteran leader of the Palestinian
communist movement, died Saturday in the West Bank city of Ramallah
after a prolonged illness, a Palestinian official said. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouti, a distant relative who heads the youth
movement of the ruling Fatah party, said Bashir Barghouti died at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Although his party never had wide representation, he was an
influential ideologue who advocated establishment of a Palestinian
state alongside Israel at a time when other Palestinians were
calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1931 near Ramallah, Barghouti was active, together with
Yasser Arafat, in the Palestinian students union at the American
University in Cairo. Arafat was later to become leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1956 with a degree in political science and
economics, Barghouti returned to the West Bank, which was then
ruled by King Hussein of Jordan. Barghouti became leader of the
Palestinian communist party, and spent a total of eight years in
Jordanian prisons, between 1954 and 1965, for his outspoken
advocacy of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, after Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
Barghouti was a pioneer in calling for a Palestinian state
alongside Israel, not in place of Israel. This was a daring
position to adopt at a time when Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the
Palestinians were smarting from their crushing defeat at Israel's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barghouti did support armed struggle against the
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and was a
founder of the alliance of Palestinian groups set up to fight the
Israelis. An Israeli military court convicted him of hostile
activity and he spent a year in jail, after which he was restricted
to the city of Ramallah for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Palestinian Authority was established in the
wake of the Oslo agreements with Israel, Barghouti was appointed
transportation minister, but he resigned a year later after a
stroke left him bedridden and unable to speak. Arafat appointed him
minister of state, an honorary position.
</P>
<P>
   Barghouti, who edited the Al-Fajar and Al-Taliya newspapers,
always preferred ideological debate to violence, said Marwan
Barghouti. ''He was one of the most influential Palestinian
intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashir Barghouti left a widow and three children. Arafat was to
attend his funeral, which was to take place Monday in Ramallah.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Aide Detained  </HEADLINE>
By DANILO BURZAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A prominent associate of President
Slobodan Milosevic said he was temporarily detained Sunday by
police in Yugoslavia's smaller republic, Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The incident signals a new escalation of tensions in the run-up
to Sept. 24 general and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ratko Krsmanovic said he would take legal action against
Montenegro's pro-Western government after being detained by police
shortly after midnight in Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital, ''for
no good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Krsmanovic was arrested because he was spraying graffiti on a
building. The official did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Krsmanovic, who was visiting Montenegro as part of election
campaigning, said he was released seven hours ''after being held in
inhumane conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a top runner for Yugoslavia's governing
leftist-nationalist alliance in the race for Yugoslavia's federal
parliament. The Yugoslav Left is a coalition party of the dominant
Socialists -- the two parties led respectively by Milosevic and his
wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro and much larger Serbia form the present-day
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller republic's own independent-minded leadership has
severed nearly all ties with Milosevic's central government in
Belgrade, protesting the president's hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro officially remains part of Yugoslavia and although
its leadership has urged citizens to boycott the coming elections,
groups and factions loyal to Milosevic have still been campaigning
and preparing to vote.
</P>
<P>
   While the Milosevic's foes in Montenegro are trying to ignore
the elections, the opposition in Serbia, Milosevic's power-base, is
campaigning intensely, despite frequent arrests and harassment of
its activists by the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's democratic opposition has urged the Montenegrin
leadership not to boycott the vote, or at least monitor the ballot,
to prevent Milosevic's supporters in the tiny republic from rigging
results.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government has nevertheless said it will
consider full independence if Milosevic stays in power.

<HEADLINE> Daily News says it regrets confusion caused by Clinton-Castro cover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Daily News said Sunday it regretted any
confusion that might have been caused by a front-page image that
made it look like President Clinton and Cuban leader Fidel Castro
were about to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The caption on the photo illustration should have directly
said that the image was not an actual photograph of the meeting,''
an editor's note in the paper said Sunday. ''The News regrets any
confusion the use of the photo illustration may have caused among
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did shake hands and exchange brief greetings
after a United Nations luncheon Wednesday, but there were no known
photographs of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's editor in chief, Ed Kosner, defended the cover
image after it appeared on Friday, saying there was no effort at
misrepresentation and the image was clearly labeled as a photo
illustration.
</P>
<P>
   The composite - made by sticking two photos together - appeared
with a caption in some editions saying ''Clinton and Castro shared
a handshake at the Millennium summit this week.'' The page also
carried the notation ''photo illustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics said such a picture could undermine the public's
trust in journalism.

<HEADLINE> Aging Fleet Has Air Force Looking  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The B-52 was born in a Dayton hotel room in
1948 when Boeing engineers put together a balsa-wood model of the
proposed bomber for officials at nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy B-52s remain active in the Air Force's aging fleet. And
with relatively few warplanes in production, the Air Force is
scrambling to extend the lives of its fighters, bombers and
tankers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The B-52 Stratofortress traces its origins to the late 1940s,
yet it's going to be flying until the early 2040s,'' said Loren
Thompson, a defense analyst with the conservative Lexington
Institute based in Arlington, Va. ''That's nearly a century, and it
tells you how unrealistic our current plans are for maintaining air
power. We're basically flying into the 21st century with some very
old technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The last B-52 was built in 1962. KC-135 tanker planes are also
nearly 40 years old. The average age of all Air Force aircraft is
21.2 years. The only new aircraft coming off assembly lines are
C-17 cargo planes and a few F-15 and F-16 fighters. The Air Force
is hoping to begin production of the new F-22 fighter soon.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that during the Clinton administration, the
procurement share of the defense budget remained consistently below
20 percent for the first time since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ''What that means is we didn't buy very many new aircraft,'' he
said. ''All sorts of things were stretched, delayed, cut back or
canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign, George W. Bush and his running
mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, have accused Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore of depleting military power. The
Democrats respond that America still has the world's best-equipped
fighting force and that money must be spent developing agility to
deal with new kinds of threats.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hellman, senior analyst with the Center for Defense
Information, a watchdog group in Washington, said that while the
fleet is aging, it remains capable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the B-52's mission over the years has changed, he
said. It is now used to launch cruise missiles far away from enemy
targets and does not have to be fast or stealthy to elude enemy
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman also said the Air Force has about 90 B-1 bombers and 21
B-2 stealth bombers, and that bombs are also launched by F-15 and
F-117 fighter jets. The problem-plagued B-1, which dates to the
1980s, was intended to replace the B-52.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the United States has used its warplanes
intensively in recent years, in the Balkans for example, making
repairs and maintenance a ''money drain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons why we can't buy new aircraft is because it
costs more and more and more to keep the old ones flying,'' he
said. ''And it's a little hard to get spare parts for an aircraft
that hasn't been built for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson predicted that the problem will either result in the
United States losing a war or scaling back on its military
commitments overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional debates over new aircraft, local interests can
be more important than party lines. The presidential campaign
highlighted how the B-2, which Gore voted for as a senator from
Tennessee, was opposed by former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and attacked as pork barrel spending by
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Two southwest Ohio congressmen, Democrat Tony Hall and
Republican David Hobson helped insert more money in this year's
defense budget to maintain aging aircraft. The Aeronautical Systems
Center at Wright-Patterson is at the forefront of research into
aircraft longevity.
</P>
<P>
   The center's aging-systems office was created four years ago and
has grown from investigating ways to prolong the lives of aircraft
bodies to trying to stretch the longevity of avionics, landing
gear, wiring and other systems.
</P>
<P>
   Its $4.9 million budget this year is expected to grow to $25.7
million next year, thanks to the boost from Congress and transfer
of some funds from work at other locations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been charged with looking at the entire aircraft now. We
basically see this as being a growth industry,'' said Debbie
Bailey, chief engineer at the office.
</P>
<P>
   The center developed ways of using ultrasonic scanners to check
for cracks and corrosion in the wings without removing fasteners
and sheet metal. There are new compounds to inhibit rust,
longer-lasting coatings and new bonding materials to repair metal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of having to rivet a metallic patch on, you can glue a
composite patch,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can find more stuff earlier and fix it while it's
relatively cheaper,'' said David Campbell, a mechanical engineer
who uses the new techniques at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma.
''The inspection times are going way down.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise Advice May Stretch Truth  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Common ideas about stretches may stretch the
truth, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stretching recommendations are clouded by misconceptions and
conflicting research reports,'' said a report in a medical journal,
The Physician and Sportsmedicine.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching is supposed to reduce the risk of injury, relieve
pain from exercise and improve performance. But the benefits are
only partly supported by the evidence, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what to stretch, for how long, and why are still up for
scientific debate, said Drs. Ian Shrier and Kav Gossal of Montreal.
New research is challenging commonly held ideas, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors checked the medical database Medline and the sports
science database SPORTDiscus for articles on stretching to help
muscles relax and lengthen after being tightened in a contraction.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that, in general, only one post-exercise
stretch of 15 to 30 seconds per muscle group is needed for most
people, although some people or muscle groups may need more. There
seems to be a limit -- after the fourth or fifth stretch, stretching
seems to make muscles tighter instead of more relaxed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Another expert finds some fault with that, however. Research
suggests that 3 to 5 stretches of 30 seconds are optimal, said Lynn
Millar of Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Mich. Larger muscle
groups such as the hamstrings in the legs benefit more from
repeated stretches than do smaller muscles such as the biceps in
the arm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the stretches are intended to relieve post-exercise aches,
additional stretching may provide greater benefits, the article
reported. Research indicates that part of the benefit of stretching
is in the mind, by increasing stretch tolerance ''patients feel
less pain for the same force applied to the muscle,'' the doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that stretching reduces the perception of pain,
although how this could work is not known, Shrier said. And,
although the benefit has been shown in research on healthy tissue,
people with injuries probably benefit as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit in pain relief might more than offset the cost in
stretch-tightened muscles, making greater stretching worthwhile,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching before exercise, a common way to prepare for sports
or exercise, isn't as valuable as exercisers think, the article
reported. An active warmup such as a jog is better, it said. For
instance, a warmup run has been shown to decrease stiffness in the
calf muscle, although not in the hamstrings, it said. And warmup
has been shown to decrease injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have found that an active warmup followed by stretching
increases range of motion better than stretching alone does, the
doctors said. But they feel the major value is in the warmup. They
warn athletes that the added stretching has not been shown to
reduce the injury rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If injury prevention is the primary objective (e.g.
recreational athletes who consider performance a secondary issue),
and the range of motion necessary for an activity is not extreme,
the evidence suggests that athletes should drop the stretching
before exercise and increase warmup,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the case for competitive athletes, Millar said.
Some preliminary research has found soccer players reduced injury
risks by stretching, although the number of players studied was too
small to draw a firm conclusion, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Static stretching -- moving slowly into a position and holding it
-- is generally considered to be less risky than dynamic stretching,
in which the athlete stretches while moving. But the risk is
probably overstated, because dynamic stretches still tax the
athlete far less than the activity for which the athlete is
preparing, the article said.
</P>
<P>
   And although textbooks commonly recommend static over dynamic
stretching, ''there isn't any research to support the idea that
there could be more injuries,'' Millar said. Her feeling is that
dynamic stretches may benefit competitive athletes because the
movements will be similar to movements they would use in their
sports.
</P>
<P>
   As for the best type of stretch, the researchers leave that to
the athlete. ''Individuals should determine a strategy for
themselves by simply holding a stretch until no additional benefit
is obtained,'' they said.

Mars, Women are from Venus'' is offering a different type of
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another element that wasn't being addressed was
over-dependence,'' says relationship guru John Gray.
''Over-dependence on our relationships (so) that we start feeling
resentful. Over-dependence on our doctors, which is a huge medical
crisis. The other crisis is over-dependence on money to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   So the self-help author and certified family therapist wants men
and women both to embrace their inner ability to find happiness,
success and love.
</P>
<P>
   His latest book - ''Practical Miracles for Mars and Venus: Nine
Principles for Lasting Love, Increasing Success and Vibrant Health
in the 21st Century'' - offers diet and health tips, stress
reducing techniques and holistic approaches to creating ''practical
miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray says the book - set to hit bookstores Tuesday - is a
culmination of his own lessons and experiences in finding inner and
physical healing.
</P>
<P>
   He is set to share some of that wisdom, focusing on personal
growth and relationships, during a lecture in Parsippany Wednesday
sponsored by Friends' Health Connection.
</P>
<P>
   ''His message would be an integral part because he talks about
having healthy relationships,'' says Roxanne Black, executive
director of the New Brunswick-based nonprofit group, which links
people with the same health problems for friendship and emotional
support. ''Having healthy relationships is part of having a healthy
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray has written some 10 books on relationships, particularly on
understanding the communication barrier between the sexes. His
books carried titles such as ''Mars and Venus in the Bedroom'' and
''Mars and Venus on a Date.''
</P>
<P>
   Since releasing his first best seller in 1993, Gray says he has
been living a high-paced and stressful life. While traveling on the
lecture circuit, he has maintained his counseling practice and
found time to write more books.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of his fame and success, Gray lost sight in his
left eye and gained weight. He says he regained his sight by
connecting with nature and his inner spirit, resulting in his own
miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole key for health techniques is to believe miracles are
possible,'' Gray says. ''The body is designed to heal itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Grays says both sexes possess the ability to make
positive changes in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking within, Gray says individuals try to find
happiness and love in others, in material things like money, and in
doctors and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens is that we disconnect with what makes us happy,''
Gray says.

<HEADLINE> Congress, Clinton Prepare To Battle  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- So little time, so many bills. And so many,
many disputes.
</P>
<P>
   With just 19 working days left until Congress' scheduled Oct. 6
adjournment, lawmakers must complete 11 spending bills for the
coming fiscal year before they can go home for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $20 billion separates Republicans from President
Clinton. But in this era of federal surpluses, fierce policy
disputes over hiring teachers, standards for drunken driving and
other issues probably will prove to be the toughest hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our problem is language this year, not money,'' said Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans find themselves in a hauntingly familiar box,
yearning to cut quick deals on the bills with Clinton but with
precious little leverage. Republican bargaining power is shackled
by Clinton's ability to veto bills, the GOP's inability to override
the vetoes, and lawmakers' craving for an early dash home for the
congressional and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get this year's final round of bargaining off to a
harmonious start, GOP leaders will meet with Clinton Tuesday at the
White House, along with top congressional Democrats. The session
seems likely to produce little if any substantive progress, leaving
the two sides even less time to resolve differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that there's a lot of work that needs to be done,
partly because so little has happened in this Congress,'' the White
House chief of staff, John Podesta, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ''Late Edition,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., cited ''all kinds of efforts to stop us passing
appropriation bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct.
1, directly control about one-third of the $1.8 trillion budget, or
more than $600 billion. Clinton has already signed the two covering
most defense programs at a cost of about $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 other bills cover 13 Cabinet-level departments and dozens
of smaller agencies, plus foreign aid and the District of
Columbia's budget, with a total price tag of about $300 billion.
Clinton wants about $20 billion more -- leaving the two sides
battling over about 1 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 11 face White House veto threats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not the only ones clamoring for higher spending.
Facing election-year demands from their members, GOP-written
spending bills so far have surpassed by at least $7 billion the
$600 billion limit their own budget clamped on.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the most contentious disputes are partisan. And among
the most furious is a battle over education, one of the top issues
in this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After initially falling about $7 billion short, Republicans have
written a bill that equals the amount Clinton wants for education,
health and welfare programs. The measure would set aside money to
help communities hire teachers and rebuild schools, two top Clinton
priorities, but give local officials the discretion to use the
money for other purposes. Administration officials adamantly oppose
such flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be quite determined in our effort to make sure we have
the resources and to make sure the programs are designed in a way
that will work,'' White House budget chief Jack Lew said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other major battlegrounds include:
</P>
<P>
   --Various bills provide less than Clinton wants for purchasing
parklands, hiring police officers, foreign aid, legal services for
the poor, environmental protection, conservation, community service
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   --House and Senate bills would prevent completion of standards
aimed at reducing workers' repetitive motion injuries.
</P>
<P>
   --A Senate bill financing the departments of Commerce, Justice
and State would block transfers of money that Justice needs to
pursue a multibillion-dollar federal lawsuit against the tobacco
industry. Clinton opposes the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton favors a Senate-approved provision establishing a
national 0.08 percent blood-alcohol level to determine drunken
driving. States not complying would lose some of their federal
highway aid. Only 18 states and the District of Columbia have a
level that low. The Senate also would block new safety rules
limiting the numbers of hours truckers could drive to 12 a day and
bar a federal study of rollovers by sports utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   --The White House has said it will not renew this year's
compromise in which it agreed to reduced family-planning aid
overseas in return for waiving restrictions on that aid.
Anti-abortion lawmakers want to retain the language.
</P>
<P>
   --Farm-state Republicans and many Democrats want four-decade-old
trade sanctions against Cuba eased. They are opposed by GOP leaders
and anti-Castro lawmakers. There also are requests for fresh aid
for farmers hurt by this summer's drought in the West.
</P>
<P>
   --The District of Columbia's budget is being delayed by fights
over conservatives' objections to distribution of free needles to
drug abusers and to let some employers sidestep requirements that
their health-insurance plans cover contraceptives.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Birth of a Nonprofit,1000  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWINGTON, Conn. (AP) - When Michelle Roy signed on as treasurer
of Birthright of Newington/New Britain, the nonprofit organization
had about $23 in the bank, she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1997, two years after four volunteers from the
Greater Hartford office of the group - which provides emergency aid
to pregnant women - formed the new branch to fill a gap in
services.
</P>
<P>
   The founders and their handful of volunteers, high on compassion
but short on business savvy, thought that would be the end of their
effort.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 check from the Archbishop of Hartford, the group's
first sizable donation, pulled them from the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, with a small army of volunteers and money in the
bank, the group is constantly reminded of the key to nonprofit
success: the heart of a volunteer, the mind of an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have the most important mission in the world, but if
you don't have the business aspect, you won't be successful,'' said
Susan Quinlan, executive director of Hartford-based Families in
Crisis, which has served inmates and their families since 1979.
''If people don't see you're efficient, they won't invest their
contributions with you.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 675,000 charitable groups nationwide, federal
records show. State records show 19,000 nonprofit groups, but that
number includes groups other than charities.
</P>
<P>
   Like a business, nonprofit charities require managers, staff and
a well-organized budget. In fact, the organizations must be
incorporated under state law.
</P>
<P>
   But many nonprofits grow out of the ideas of social workers,
homemakers or retirees - not CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think about starting a nonprofit everyday,'' said
Marcia Levinson Mason, director of the resource center at the
United Way of the Capital Area. ''But this is not something any of
us are born knowing how to do. There are many examples of people
who figure it out. Often it's the passion that allows them to
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The four women who began Birthright of Newington/New Britain had
the passion. They believed they would figure out the rest as they
went along.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was fear and excitement,'' said Mary St. Pierre,
co-director of the group.
</P>
<P>
   With start-up funds from the Greater Hartford office and donated
legal advice, the women filed for incorporation with the secretary
of the state and tax exempt status with the Internal Revenue
Service. The applications can take up to $500 and six months to be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   They adopted a charter and a training program laid out by
Birthright International, their parent organization with 500
offices in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And they advertised through church bulletins, billboards and
buses. Within a few weeks, clients - and volunteers - began
trickling through the doors of their tiny basement office.
</P>
<P>
   ''After about six months, we started to have numbers that showed
people were finding us,'' St. Pierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 1997 marked a low point. The group struggled through with
the aid of a pro bono accountant and the addition of Roy, a mother
of two who had some background in business. In 1999, the group
applied for and received its first grant from the United Way, a
community chest which lends funding and credibility to its member
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This year the group has boosted its volunteer ranks to about two
dozen, holds 20 office hours a week and serves 25 new clients a
month, St. Pierre said. It held its two most successful
fund-raisers - a $5,000 Mother's Day rose sale and a $4,000
phone-a-thon.
</P>
<P>
   But a petition to take part in a state employee contribution
program reminded the group's leaders of how much they still have to
learn. The group was rejected because they had improperly budgeted
expenses, making it seem as though a third of their funds were
spent on just running the office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first year we applied for that kind of funding,''
said Linda Nappi, co-director of Birthright. ''We didn't know what
a lot of the abbreviations (on the application) meant.''
</P>
<P>
   The program committee, recognizing the group's inexperience, in
June gave them a second chance to fill out the paperwork and the
number of someone who could help. That application was eventually
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Birthright illustrates the problem smaller nonprofits have,
and that is really being able to operate as a business given the
limited resources they have,'' said Christine Fortunato, an
advocate for the disabled who served on the committee. ''We want to
see them thrive. These are people who really do good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike for-profit businesses, nonprofits often have a higher
accountability to the public. The groups have to persuade donors to
part with their money and then prove through programs and financial
reports that those dollars are being well-spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Macauley, the industrialist who founded New Canaan-based
AmeriCares, a $300 million-a-year relief organization, had a long
history of involvement with nonprofits. Macauley knew the
regulations, the resources and the practices needed to start
another organization, vice chairman Andrew Hannah said.
</P>
<P>
   A person without that background must find others to fill the
knowledge gaps. Help can come from a parent organization, corporate
sponsors and charitable foundations, resource centers like the
United Way and the Connecticut Association of Nonprofits, social
service agencies and even consultants.
</P>
<P>
   A simple mission and a good board can help a group avoid
burnout. The directors of Birthright of Newington/New Britain
recognize that and say they will stick with their small operation -
for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're holding our own, showing a plus in the bank account,''
Nappi said. ''We're getting stronger. With experience, you learn.
You get seasoned a bit.''

<HEADLINE> Surveillance Cameras Watch Britons  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- One of Britain's favorite summer TV shows has been
''Big Brother,'' featuring people living under the constant gaze of
surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
   That's not so far from reality in modern-day Britain, whose 60
million people are tracked by an estimated 1.5 million
closed-circuit TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the bank or the supermarket, walking down the street,
using a payphone, waiting for a train, slipping out for a pint at
the pub, you're likely to be on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mania,'' says Simon Davies of the civil liberties group
Privacy International, which came up with the figure of 1.5
million. ''The cameras are out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest innovation is a roving surveillance ''supervan''
unveiled this week by Westminster City Council, which oversees
London's entertainment -- and crime -- hot spots of Soho and the West
End. The $185,000 vehicle sports a retractable mast and nine CCTV
cameras, and this month will start prowling the streets looking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have reports of an outbreak of anti-social behavior, we
can deploy the van,'' said Westminster Council spokeswoman Suzanna
White. ''We may also want to use it in a covert manner, for example
to collect evidence for legal proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The British government has poured millions into helping police
forces and local authorities get the video technology.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the cameras say they deter criminals and aid
investigations. Their images, police say, were crucial in catching
David Copeland, the bomber who targeted black, Asian and gay
Londoners last year.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance is getting smarter and its reach greater. The
throngs of shoppers on Oxford Street in London are tracked by 16
cameras linked to nearby Marylebone police station.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Humphreys, director of the Oxford Street Association, says
the system has helped curb street crime and theft.
</P>
<P>
   According to Inspector Allan Thompson of Marylebone police, the
system's record is mixed. In its first six months after being
introduced in 1998, pickpocketing fell by 44 percent, street crime
by 20 percent and burglary by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But pickpocketing is back to its pre-1998 level, while street
crime stands slightly above the 1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson attributes the change to criminals being unaware of the
cameras, and to having fewer police on the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Davies traces Britain's embrace of CCTV to the 1980s, when
cameras were installed at soccer stadiums to combat hooliganism.
From there, they spread to surrounding areas and city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Davies argues that cameras don't reduce crime, but merely
displace it, and do little to deter professional or drug-fueled
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the technology also argue the cameras are anything
but neutral, all-seeing eyes. A study published in 1997 by
researchers at Hull University's Center for Criminology and
Criminal Justice found that camera operators often selected their
targets based on racial prejudice and voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only issues that have been raised have been raised by the
media,'' counters Westminster Council's Humphreys. ''Most members
of the public realize that if you've not done anything wrong, you
have nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the 1998 Data Protection Act says people must be
told they are being filmed -- although in practice the law is not
always enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Police officer Thompson said big warning signs were set up in
Oxford Street, but the municipality ordered them removed.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments in the United States have been slower to adopt
camera surveillance, says Robert Ellis Smith of the Rhode
Island-based newsletter Privacy Journal. He estimates that fewer
than 50 U.S. municipalities have set up video surveillance in
downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   But cameras are pervasive on U.S. highways and urban
intersections, in shopping malls, banks and workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody in the U.S. has stopped to consider the
impact on our culture,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Even police inspector Thompson urges caution, saying cameras
should be kept out of residential areas. ''I wouldn't be too happy
if someone put a CCTV camera in my street,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Officials May Be Go Trial  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Ten years ago Monday the butchered body of
human rights leader Myrna Mack was found on a downtown sidewalk,
serving as a horrific reminder that no one here was safe from the
wrath of Guatemala's military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade of delays and last-ditch appeals,
Guatemala's highest court has apparently opened the door for three
ex-Guatemalan army officials to go to trial for ordering Mack's
killing.
</P>
<P>
   But the case, which has become a symbol of everything considered
wrong with this country's legal system, has been down this road
before without ever seeing the inside of a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could be entering the final stages. We could be on the edge
of justice,'' said Helen Mack, a prominent Guatemala City lawyer
who founded a human rights group in the name of her slain sister.
''But we could just as easily have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Mack was a Guatemalan who worked with a group that had
accused the army of human rights violations. She was stabbed 27
times by two attackers in broad daylight outside her downtown
Guatemala City office on Sept. 11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Police insisted the attack was a common robbery. But after an
international outcry, the government extradited Noel de Jesus
Beteta Alvarez from California to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the Guatemalan presidential guard -- notorious
for doing the military's dirty work -- Alvarez was sentenced to 30
years in prison for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, prosecutors said Mack's killing was a
calculated army scare tactic directed at human rights groups.
Still, the government and military leaders maintained that Mack's
murder was only a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups felt vindicated in 1996 when retired Gen. Juan
Valencia Osorio and former colonels Juan Guillermo Oliva and Edgar
Augusto Godoy were arrested for their suspected roles in Mack's
death.
</P>
<P>
   But an army of military lawyers succeeded in getting their
clients released from prison and placed under a relaxed form of
house arrest, which has required them to check in with a judge once
a week while awaiting a possible trial.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of legal wrangling, declassified U.S. State
Department documents suggested that Mack's death was politically
motivated and indicated that an order to have her silenced came
from the Guatemalan military's upper echelon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that information, in February of last year a judge
ordered the military trio to stand trial for directing Mack's
killing.
</P>
<P>
   But the impending trial was postponed when defense lawyers
demanded their clients be tried by a military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Judge Otto Marroquin rejected the appeals and gave a
lower criminal court a month to set a new trial date for the Mack
case. Defense lawyers vowed to mount more appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This recent ruling is good news because this is Guatemala's
highest court finally saying enough is enough,'' said Carmen Aida
Ibarra, a legal adviser for the Myrna Mack Foundation. ''But
certainly no one here is jumping for joy. We've been here before,
and now we are just waiting to see what the military lawyers try
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Laureate Rigoberta Menchu said the slow progress of the
Mack case was one of the reasons she gave up on Guatemala's court
system and filed a December genocide complaint against former
Guatemalan leaders before Spain's National Court.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu's complaint dealt with three separate human rights cases:
a 1980 arson at the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City that killed
37 people, the slaying of three Spanish priests in western
Guatemala, and the deaths of members of Menchu's own family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad that the case cannot be solved when it's evident that
the guilty parties are there for everyone to see,'' the 1992 Nobel
Peace Prize winner said in an interview Saturday. ''It is the best
example we have seen of impunity in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   But Helen Mack says her foundation hasn't given up. ''This is a
process, and we will be here for every step of it,'' she said.
''The truth can only be covered up for so long.''

<HEADLINE> Flood in Italy Kills at Least Nine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOVERATO, Italy (AP) -- The rain-swollen waters of a stream swept
through a campground filled with disabled campers in the southern
region of Calabria before dawn Sunday, killing at least nine people
and injuring dozens as they slept, authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
   RAI state TV's reporter at the Le Giare campground near the
seaside town of Soverato said that by early evening 10 bodies had
been pulled out of the mud, but a civil defense official in the
Calabrian city of Catanzaro said officials could confirm only nine
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Sebastiano Cento, said 12 people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters turned the campground where disabled campers
from Calabria and their volunteer aides have gone every summer for
seven years into a sea of mud, flipping over cars, shoving trailers
into trees and smashing bungalows.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first victims to be identified was that of
52-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease, the Italian news agency
ANSA said. Organizers of the camping trip said the man was the only
disabled person among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead was 17-year-old Rosario Russo, who was carried
hundreds of yards by the raging muddy waters after he helped safely
move his father, who uses a wheelchair, to higher ground, ANSA
said. Rescuers removed the boy's body from the tangled branches of
an uprooted tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized it was hell at 10 minutes to 5,'' Cesare Sforza
Rotundo, one of the volunteers told ANSA after being discharged
from a hospital. ''I didn't realize anything, I only heard
agonizing screams.''
</P>
<P>
   Police with dogs searched the flattened campground for possible
victims under the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the camping trip said that it was difficult to say
exactly how many people were at the site when the flood struck
because some families on Saturday started bringing relatives home
because of the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials said 44 people were taken to hospitals.
Most of the injured were suffering from exposure to the cold water.
</P>
<P>
   RAI said local newspapers for years had run stories questioning
the wisdom of a campground right next to a stream. Magistrates
began investigating to see if any laws were violated in running the
campground at that location, RAI said.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the stream, a 17-year-old shepherd was stranded on a
rock in the middle of the rushing water, said Luigi Bigagnoli, a
civil defense official in Catanzaro. Rain was hampering efforts to
pluck him to safety with a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Calabria, the body of a man, apparently the victim
of the bad weather, was found along a beach, Italian news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of intense heat and practically no rain, storms
started pounding much of southern Italy on Friday, isolating dozens
of hamlets near the sea.
</P>
<P>
   About a hundred houses were evacuated in the seaside town of

<HEADLINE> Rabbi's Internet search prompts book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Rabbi Joshua Hammerman made an uplifting
discovery when he started searching for God on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman, who leads Stamford's conservative Jewish
congregation, Temple Beth El, tried a search by typing in ''God.''
</P>
<P>
   The search reaped about 2 million hits and was the brainchild
for his recently released book, ''thelordismyshepherd.com: Seeking
God in Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman's book explores the reasons that people are using the
Internet to find faith. He's concluded that younger generations are
not rejecting God but understanding him in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to
religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions
use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,''
Hammerman said.
</P>
<P>
   While many young people don't set foot in a church, synagogue or
mosque, they may be more likely to discuss religion in a chat room
or surf for Web sites where they can learn about different
religions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole notion of God as the pastor leading the flock of
congregations and parishes, most people now can't relate to that,''
Hammerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people are identifying God with the concept of the
World Wide Web, ''that God seems to be within and between us,
rather than above us.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey found that 75 percent of Internet users have
engaged Web searches with religious themes.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is sometimes viewed as an alienating force, driving
surfers into an artificial world and away from real human contact.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman, unlike many mainstream religious leaders, views the
Internet as a vessel for improved communication between people,
with the power to ''connect us in ways we've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some churches and congregations, including Hammerman's, have Web
sites. In the future, prayer services will probably be available
online, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman has even married a couple who met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is something real happening in the virtual
world,'' he said. ''The word 'religion,' in Latin, actually means
'reconnect.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The book is supplemented by a Web site, aptly addressed,
thelordismyshepherd.com, where surfers can read about the book and
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerman, 43, has led Temple Beth El for 13 years. He was
formerly the first pulpit rabbi to be president of The Council of
Churches &AMP; Synagogues of Southwestern Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Demographics, City Council term limits spur primary battles in New York </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Immigrants and shifting populations in and
around New York City fuel several primary House challengers, with
some incumbents facing serious threats in Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In a Brooklyn district that has seen a surge in immigrants from
the Caribbean, a challenger stresses her Jamaican roots. In another
district in the Bronx, where a growing black and Hispanic
population has become the majority, a veteran white congressman
faces a black challenger who emphasizes minority empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   As voters in eight states and the District of Columbia pick fall
candidates on Tuesday, the most contentious races come in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton even faces a token challenge from Dr.
Mark McMahon, an orthopedic surgeon. Her Senate opponent in
November, Rep. Rick Lazio, faces no Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   There is a five-way slugfest for Lazio's open seat on Long
Island. Lazio is backing Islip Town Clerk Joan Johnson, who if
elected would become the first black woman Republican in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the eastern tip of Long Island,
Republican-turned-Democrat Michael Forbes faces opposition from
within his new party. Forbes, a former acolyte of Newt Gingrich,
abandoned the Republican Party complaining about the extremism of
GOP House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hungry to win the few seats needed to reclaim the
House wooed the three-term incumbent despite his votes to impeach
President Clinton, opposition to abortion and other conservative
positions.
</P>
<P>
   But 71-year-old Regina Seltzer, a former librarian and town
councilwoman who went to law school at age 50, gathered enough
signatures on her own to plunge into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''My running allows Democrats to vote for a real Democrat, not
some phony Washington is trying to shove down our throats.'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, the race between six-term Rep. Eliot Engel and
state Sen. Larry Seabrook has been one of this year's most bitter.
Seabrook has been campaigning with the Rev. Al Sharpton and accused
Engel of failing to meet the needs of his mostly minority
constituents. The district covers the northern Bronx and southern
Westchester County. Engel has fired back by accusing the Seabrook
camp of being anti-Jewish and injecting race into the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has also developed into something of a soap opera,
with the Seabrook camp rocked by reports that he and his wife
continued to file joint tax returns after they were divorced.
Seabrook and his ex-wife now claim that neither knew of the divorce
until several years after it became official.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn City Councilwoman Una Clarke's decision to challenge
Rep. Major Owens, her one-time ally, has helped to highlight
tensions within the black community between those who migrated to
New York from the South and the area's diverse new Caribbean
immigrant population. Owens was born in Memphis, Tenn., Clarke in
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The district is about 67 percent black, a large portion
Caribbean blacks. In communities like Flatbush, calypso and reggae
music spill from the stores selling Caribbean specialties like
spiced bread.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and Owens have accused one another of trying to divide
the black community. During a recent debate on the cable news
channel New York 1, Owens said that by focusing on her Jamaican
background Clarke has been playing on prejudices. Clarke accused
Owens of trying to drive a wedge between recent immigrants and
blacks born in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke says when it comes down to it, her bid against Owens
is about leadership and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he has kept up with the needs of the changing
communities,'' she said
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a nine-term incumbent known as one of the most liberal
members of the House, scoffs that Clarke is in the race because
City Council term limits will put her out of a job at the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Those term limits will oust three-fourths of the city's 51
council members next year, leaving many scrambling for new
political posts. Also among them is Councilman Noach Dear, who is
challenging freshman Rep. Anthony Weiner in a heavily Jewish
Brooklyn district.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is the linchpin in one
other hotly contested race in Brooklyn. Lawyer Barry Ford is
forcing Rep. Edolphus Towns to defend his decision to cross party
lines and endorse Giuliani in 1997. Giuliani is unpopular in
minority communities, partly because of his handling of police
shootings.

<HEADLINE> Soda contracts are lucrative for colleges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The cola war has come to the college
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to buy a Pepsi at Southern Connecticut State
University, a Coke-only campus since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Bridgeport, new Pepsi machines are popping
up in dorms, the recreation center and student lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, college campuses in the state and across the
nation are becoming exclusive bastions of one of America's two soft
drink titans. And they're getting big money for it.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Connecticut is under a five-year contract with
Coke. In exchange for exclusive rights to all vending machines,
soda fountains, and even special events on all of UConn's campuses,
Coke is giving the university $1,087,500.
</P>
<P>
   UB just entered a 10-year, $100,000 contract to provide full
vending and dining-hall fountain service, said Kelly McAndrew, of
the Pepsi Bottling Group in Somers, N.Y. The university will also
get a 20 percent commission on all vending products.
</P>
<P>
   Southern, once a Pepsi school, is exclusively Coke through 2003.
Southern gets $300,000 over the five-year contract, which is being
put toward athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   At Fairfield University, it's Pepsi. Sacred Heart University is
in the third of a 10-year deal with Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Quinnipiac University in Hamden and Yale University
say they have no exclusive beverage contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study found Pepsi had 62 contracts with universities
while Coke had 60. Conducted by Lee White, a researcher for George
K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Denver, the survey also found some campuses had
contracts with both and one had a contract with Dr. Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 382 of 2,000 colleges responded to the survey. Together,
those colleges received $16.8 million in payments for beverage
contracts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A more up-to-date survey is underway. It appears, though, the
bigger the school, the more lucrative the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Minnesota, with 37,000 students, reportedly
has a 10-year deal with Coke worth up to $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as Coke and Pepsi feel that its worth their while to
do these kinds of arrangements, colleges are going to take
advantage of it,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The cola war has also seeped down into high schools. Trumbull
High School, two years ago, switched from Pepsi to Coke vending
machines and got new scoreboards and some scholarship money.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert in Washington, D.C.,
said universities shouldn't push junk food on students just to make
a buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''These products are not good for people,'' Ruskin said. ''Is it
the role of a university to be advertiser for junk food? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin also questions the strings that may come attached to such
contracts. ''Universities play a very important role in our society
in shaping young minds and doing research. They ought to be free of
commercial values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Molnar, director of the Center for the Analysis of
Commercialism in Education at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee, said having a soft drink monopoly is anti-competitive.
Proponents say the contracts result from competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges that become dependent of private sources of revenue
make themselves vulnerable to the private interest paying for that
access, Mulnar said.
</P>
<P>
   White prefers to think of it as a wise financial decision.
''Some people don't like colleges to get commercial but third party
vendor contracts have been part of higher education for many many
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McAndrew of Pepsi said it's usually the school, not the soft
drink company, that makes the first move to see if they can get
something more out of the relationship than soda.

<HEADLINE> 'Cats' Calling It Quits  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Now and forever'' is here and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats,'' Broadway's longest running show, hung up its whiskers,
tails and toe shoes Sunday after nearly 18 years and a record 7,485
performances.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional weekend at the Winter Garden Theater,
starting with the Saturday matinee where the audience included
alumni from the musical's Broadway and touring productions. The
Saturday evening performance was a special benefit for the Actors'
Fund, the theater service organization that takes care of
entertainment professionals. And the final performance Sunday was
by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats,'' which has music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, is based on
''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,'' a collection of poems by
T.S. Eliot, who even though he died in 1965, received a Tony Award
18 years later for his contributions to the score. His widow became
a very wealthy woman, receiving royalties from a show that has
grossed more than $380 million on Broadway alone.
</P>
<P>
   The musical began the dominance of the big British musical on
Broadway, an influence that has started to slip -- ''Miss Saigon''
also will close New Year's Eve -- but may never fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, two others -- 'Les Miserables' and 'The Phantom of
the Opera' -- are still with us,'' theater historian Ken Mandelbaum
said. ''And one, if not two, may eventually pass 'Cats' in
longevity. 'Phantom' only has six years to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' was considered quite unusual when it first opened on
Broadway, Mandelbaum said. ''It wasn't a book musical. It was all
music and very dependent on dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the musical became the show people loved to
hate, with everyone from Letterman to Leno making fun of its pop
score, lavish setting and those furry creatures crawling all over
the stage and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''If 'Cats' had only run four or five years, there wouldn't have
been the resentment again it,'' Mandelbaum says. ''People didn't
want it to be the longest running show,'' especially after it took
the long-run crown away from a homegrown product, ''A Chorus
Line,'' in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, audiences came, singing ''Memory,'' the show's most
persistent melody, sung in the show by Grizabella, the musical's
faded glamour cat, who climbs in the show's final moments to ''the
heavy-side layer,'' a feline version of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' went out with a roar rather than a meow.
</P>
<P>
   The show originally was to have closed June 25, but a surge in
ticket sales led to an extension. For much of the summer, it was
one of Broadway's highest-grossing shows, often operating at more
than 90 percent capacity and pulling in grosses of more than
$550,000 a week as tourists and die-hard fans flocked back.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1982, the Winter Garden, one of
Broadway's most visible theaters, will be dark. One of the few
theaters actually located on Broadway, Winter Garden has a giant
marquee that until now has sported the show's ubiquitous logo -- a
pair of yellow cats' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A new tenant already has been booked and theater people think it
could be the next blockbuster. After an extensive renovation and
restoration, the Winter Garden will reopen with another London
success: ''Mamma Mia!'' -- a musical built around ABBA's greatest
hits. Yet don't plan on seeing it anytime soon. Opening night for
''Mamma Mia!'': Oct. 18, 2001.

<P>
	   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer is trying to
trump Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer wrote a letter asking the Bureau of Indian Affairs to
defuse any application billionaire developer Donald Trump may make
to create a casino in New York City, since it could draw gamblers
from a planned Catskills casino.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said in Tuesday's New York Post that if state and federal
officials approve a proposed Indian casino in Monticello, he will
push for one on 100 acres (40 hectares) of undeveloped land he owns
near the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was casino gambling in Manhattan, Sullivan County
would not do as well with it,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said Tuesday he would be hesitant about such
a project outside of the Catskills and in Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   Trump could not be reached for comment Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Scientific glassblowers continue an old trade in modern form  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) - In a small room at the back of Merck's
gleaming corporate campus, the 2,000-year-old art of glassblowing
thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Here, glassblowers Wayne Dockery and Harold ''Heimey'' Heimback
work with scientists to create devices that help develop the latest
medicines, as well as the first-ever automated tick feeder and a
flea counter (for agricultural research) that allows only one flea
to move through a passage at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The flea counter, shaped somewhat like an hourglass, has a
narrow ''waist'' blown to just the width of one flea. The tick
feeder allows scientists to nourish the insects without keeping a
live animal in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every flat surface in the shop is covered with fireproof
material, much of it blackened from years of exposure to open
flames. The shop is warm much of the time, and - when the two are
working on a particularly large piece - the heat can be
destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hot enough to melt your buttons,'' said Dockery, adding
that he's ruined several shirts that way over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Like many glassblowing shops, the center of the room is
dominated by a giant lathe that can hold pieces several feet in
diameter. On a recent day in August, the device spun slowly under
steadily decreasing heat to allow it to cool without cracking. Set
up on countertops to the side are flame ''lamps'' used to work
smaller pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women who form and temper intricate equipment for
chemists, biologists and other laboratory scientists say their
skills are increasingly in demand, as the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries grow.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part, they say, is finding workers with the
coordination and patience the job requires.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an art, and not everyone realizes it's an art,'' said
Bill Robbins, production manager at Kontes glassblowers in
Vineland. ''Not everyone gets to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the profession of scientific glassblowing are
custom glassblowers - the people who can take scientists' vague
ideas for experiments and turn them into complex laboratory
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, they're just blue-sky ideas,'' said Daryl
Smith, a former Kontes glassblower who works at the nation's only
scientific glassblowing degree program, at Salem Community College
in Carneys Point.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Briening, who works at the college and as a glassblower
at Hercules Incorporated in Wilmington, Del., said the process of
creating an entirely new piece is among the most challenging a
glassblower can face.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have a whole different approach,'' he said. ''You're not
limited by previous experiences, so you can really brainstorm and
find new venues to reach your goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is in the heart of southern New Jersey, where
glassblowing got its start in this country. In the late 18th
century, the pure sand in Salem and Cumberland counties drew
glassblowers to set up shop in the Vineland area. The school
followed the teachers and the jobs, beginning the glassblowing
program in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Hodgkins, office manager at the American Scientific
Glassblowers Society in Thomasville, N.C., said there are about
2,500 scientific glassblowers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're coming from all over, but most of them either start in
that area or they may move there to go to the school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Briening said the field is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's an increasing number of people that would like
to be glassblowers,'' he said, ''and I think there's an increasing
number of opportunities in glass.''
</P>
<P>
   The college admits about 20 students each year into the two-year
program. In addition to the mechanics of glassblowing, they learn
math, physics, chemistry and computer sciences.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, students begin at the bottom rung of
glassblowing as lathe operators - production line work that
requires making one item over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''To attain top status, it takes eight to 10 years,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the profession because the work is stable for those
who are talented.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a needed skill, so I changed my career path'' from
environmental science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a good glassblower, in addition to patience, are
coordination and imagination, according to Smith and Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   A glassblower can remain a lathe operator for an entire career
or move on to custom work - either for a company that sells catalog
and custom-designed glass, or for university and corporate
laboratories, many of which have their own glassblowers.
</P>
<P>
   Briening said glassblower salaries vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can go to whatever level you aspire to,'' he said. ''You
can become an entrepreneur or you could work in a factory.''
</P>
<P>
   At Merck, the two glassblowers have 65 years' combined
experience. Dockery, the chief glassblower, is the son of the man
who ran the shop for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dockery and Heimback create and repair thousands of glass pieces
each year for Merck scientists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chemist Herbert Conner, who works with Briening at Hercules,
said he has used the work of custom glassblowers frequently
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Glass is a wonderful material to do chemistry (in) because it
allows you to do fairly heroic chemistry and still see what you're
doing,'' he said. ''In the hands of a skilled glassmaker, it's
possible to do things with the containers that you cannot do using
other methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat and glass can cause injuries, Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're working with fire and you're working with glass, so the
risk factors are high,'' he said, but injuries happen less
frequently than might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Heimback himself, after 28 years in the trade, displays scars
and burns on his hands and forearms.
</P>
<P>
   Glass - which consists of sand and additives for heat resistance
- acts like a solid, but has many of the properties of liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's actually flowing all the time,'' Heimback said.
</P>
<P>
   When glass is heated - to temperatures of 3,900 to 5,400 degrees
Fahrenheit - it begins to flow more quickly and becomes flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wants to twist and turn and bend,'' Heimback said. Because
it's cheap, easy to work with and clear, he added, ''glass is a
perfect research tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassblowers created the first contact lenses and made possible
the laser printer and the first semiconductor discs, Briening said.
</P>
<P>
   At Merck, many of the pieces created by the glassblowers are
unique.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the more repetitious aspects of the trade have been
automated, Smith said, most glassblowers aren't afraid they will
lose their jobs to machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Philosophically, anything can be automated,'' he said, adding,
''You have companies that downsize. I've never seen them lay off a
glassblower.''

<HEADLINE> Flood in Italy Kills at Least 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOVERATO, Italy (AP) -- The rain-swollen waters of a stream swept
through a campground filled with disabled campers in the southern
region of Calabria before dawn Sunday, killing at least 10 people
and injuring dozens as they slept, authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Enzo Bianco, who arrived in Calabria in the
evening, told reporters that 10 people had died and five were
missing at the Le Giare campground near the seaside town of
Soverato.
</P>
<P>
   The muddy waters destroyed the campground's guest register,
complicating the task of accounting for the living, the dead and
the missing.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters turned the campground, where disabled campers
from Calabria and their volunteer aides have gone every summer for
seven years, into a sea of mud, flipping over cars, shoving
trailers into trees and smashing bungalows.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first victims to be identified was that of
52-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease, the Italian news agency
ANSA said. Organizers of the camping trip said the man was the only
disabled person among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead was 17-year-old Rosario Russo, who was carried
hundreds of yards by the raging muddy waters after he helped safely
move his father, who uses a wheelchair, to higher ground, ANSA
said. Rescuers removed the boy's body from the tangled branches of
an uprooted tree.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized it was hell at 10 minutes to 5,'' Cesare Sforza
Rotundo, one of the volunteers told ANSA after being discharged
from a hospital. ''I didn't realize anything, I only heard
agonizing screams.''
</P>
<P>
   Police with dogs searched the flattened campground for possible
victims under the mud, and later floodlights were turned on so
rescue efforts could continue after nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the camping trip said that it was difficult to say
exactly how many people were at the site when the flood struck
because some families on Saturday started bringing relatives home
because of the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials said 44 people were taken to hospitals.
Most of the injured were suffering from exposure to the cold water.
</P>
<P>
   RAI said local newspapers for years had run stories questioning
the wisdom of a campground right next to a stream. Magistrates
began investigating to see if any laws were violated in running the
campground at that location, RAI said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't have been allowed,'' the government's
undersecretary for civil defense, Franco Barberi, said of the
campground's placement.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the stream, a 17-year-old shepherd was stranded for
hours on a rock in the middle of the rushing water, said Luigi
Bigagnoli, a civil defense official in Catanzaro. Stormy weather
hampered efforts to pluck him to safety with a helicopter, but
rescuers finally succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Calabria, the body of a man, apparently the victim
of the bad weather, was found along a beach, Italian news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of intense heat and practically no rain, storms
started pounding much of southern Italy on Friday, isolating dozens
of hamlets near the sea.
</P>
<P>
   About a hundred houses were evacuated in the seaside town of
Roccella Jonica.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Refugees Follow Debate  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAQAA CAMP, Jordan (AP) -- Young Palestinian refugees walked to
school Sunday under a scorching sun and through dusty alleyways,
some barefooted, many wearing T-shirts bearing the map of
British-mandated Palestine or arm and head bands reading:
''Palestine is alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Such clothing is turned out by tiny printing shops in the
refugee camp catering to the dreams of young Palestinians who have
never seen their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can we forget our home when we constantly hear our parents
and grandparents talk about it?'' said 10th grader Ahmad Atta, 16,
who wore one of the T-shirts. His family fled the West Bank town of
Hebron during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Palestine is alive in our hearts and minds and we yearn for
the Palestinian leadership to declare statehood so that we can go
home,'' said the resident of Baqaa, 17 miles northwest of the
Jordanian capital Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's 1.57 million Palestinian refugees watched closely this
weekend as Palestinian lawmakers in the Gaza Strip debated when to
declare statehood and decided to put off a declaration for at least
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians had agreed that Sept. 13 was the
target date for completing a peace treaty and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat had set that as the deadline for declaring statehood.
But the Palestinian Central Council voted Sunday to delay a
unilateral declaration in hopes of giving negotiators more time to
work out a settlement with Israel that would include recognition of
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The body expects a progress report on statehood by Nov. 12, the
12th anniversary of a symbolic declaration of statehood-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Palestinian refugees was among the items to be
addressed in a Palestinian-Israeli settlement. Jordan has said
Palestinians can remain in the kingdom and enjoy full citizenship
rights if they wish. But Jordan insists that a Palestinian-Israeli
accord should ensure the right of the refugees to return home and
be compensated for their agony and lost property.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Palestinian refugees are among 3.5 million Palestinians
and their descendants who were displaced in two Middle East wars
since Israel's creation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   They live in squalid camps. With international funding short,
the United Nations struggles to provide health care, education and
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Abu Taha shares a one-room brick house with his seven
children from two marriages at Baqaa -- the largest among Jordan's
13 camps and home to more than 120,000 refugees. Abu Taha is
unemployed and lives off a U.N. monthly stipend of $90.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am poor, unemployed and I sleep on the floor with my
children. But that doesn't matter because this all will be
forgotten when I return home,'' said the 68-year-old Palestinian
from the village of Ajjour on Hebron's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of Baqaa, farmer Talaat Abu Hussein, 55, interrupted
his harvest of cabbage to sigh as he recalled his home in the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to go home; we don't want money from the Jews,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our land is precious and we would not sell it for anything in
the world,'' he added, then grabbed a handful of dirt and shouted
in English: ''Our earth!''

<HEADLINE> As Corzine pours his cash into TV, Franks finds it hard to come by  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Republican Bob Franks has found the going
tough in the quest to raise the kinds of dollars he will need to
compete with Democrat Jon Corzine in the race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who shattered U.S. spending records last spring with
$36.7 million just to win a party primary, has spent about $1.2
million on television in the last week alone. That's almost as much
as Franks apparently has raised so far for his entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spend a good deal of time every day trying to raise money,
and I spend a good deal of time every day shaking hands with
voters,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason he has had such tough going is that
operatives are at work across New Jersey scaring up money not only
for congressional candidates but for GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush and New York Senate candidate Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Senate President Donald DiFrancesco,
R-Union, already is hard at work raising funds for the 2001 Senate
races in New Jersey - a process that also helps him in his quest
for the Republican nomination to run for governor. DiFrancesco has
a major gala scheduled in three weeks at the Meadowlands with
tickets selling briskly now.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' campaign manager, Charlie Smith, acknowledged the
competition for Republican donors is stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, the high level of fund-raising activity for a
number of competitive races this year in New Jersey at the
congressional level, for the competitive race in neighboring New
York, and for the very expensive presidential campaign, have made
this a very complicated and difficult fund-raising environment,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any additional fund-raising for races that are being run in
the future in subsequent years, common sense dictates that makes it
even more difficult,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Louis Bassano, R-Union, agreed the work done now to raise
funds for next year dwindles the pool of donors available for
Franks in his race this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is so much pressure for whatever money is out there,
from however many sources, yes, I have to say he is hurt by that,''
Bassano said. ''We all have sympathy for the next guy but we all
worry about ourselves and we all paddle our own canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Sico, a chief aide to Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, said
the speaker has not planned any fund-raisers until the Franks race
is finished. Collins also has to raise a warchest to help his
Assembly members win re-election in 2001 and intends to run for
governor himself.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco and Collins can solicit funds for their statewide
accounts in $30,000 chunks, but federal law limits such gifts to
congressional candidates to $1,000. It further bars corporations or
unions from giving anything to congressional candidates, although
individual officers are free to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will not publicly discuss how much money Franks has in the
bank and what has been spent until a required federal report due
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But an activist in the state Republican Party told The
Associated Press Friday that Franks had only about $1.3 million to
$1.4 million promised or on hand. A political operative familiar
with Franks' campaign said it was closer to $1.5 million, a figure
the Star-Ledger of Newark quoted last week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Corzine is expected to keep airing his TV spots in
both New York and Philadelphia ''at about the same level'' this
week, according to a campaign aide.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lobbyist Tom Wilson said Corzine's huge win in the June 6
primary, and the huge cost, influenced potential donors from other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a whole sector that immediately wrote off the New
Jersey campaign because of the massive amount of spending,'' Wilson
said. He said Franks' steady improvement in polls and his ability
to attack Corzine on issues will loosen those out-of-state purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   Franks in June said he would seek about $8 million for the fall
race, but more recently his campaign has toned that down to $5
million. Republican analysts have said the reduction is appropriate
since Corzine was quiet all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are looking basically at having a TV presence for the last
21 days ... to be credible,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sico said national Republican party officials have
shown growing concern that Corzine's advertising could help Hillary
Clinton in the close-fought U.S. Senate race in New York. Sico said
he expected the national GOP to respond to this by helping Franks
get on TV earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people nationally who are concerned that
Corzine's money, especially in the New York media market, is going
to help Hillary, so they are going to be willing to prop up Bob to
help Lazio,'' he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Luciano Pavarotti, one of the world's most
famous opera stars, has collaborated with a number of pop
musicians, including U2's Bono, Mariah Carey, Ricky Martin and the
Eurythmics' Annie Lennox.
</P>
<P>
   But Madonna has been playing hard to get.
</P>

   ''I have wanted to sing with Madonna for a very long time,''
said Pavarotti in Sunday's editions of The New York Post. ''She has
promised that she would sing, but I do not know if she was joking
or serious. But I think she was serious because she is a serious
lady. She is also a superb singer.''
</P>

   Pavarotti, 64, is scheduled to perform at Madison Square Garden

<HEADLINE> Snoopy Statues To Be Auctioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Even Snoopy has his price.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 Snoopy statues created by local artists and
displayed throughout the city to honor cartoonist Charles Schulz in
his hometown will be auctioned off by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   The city and United Media, which controls the late cartoonist's
entertainment empire, are hoping Sotheby's can re-create the
success of its ''Cows on Parade'' auction in Chicago. Last summer's
auction of 140 cow statues generated $3.5 million, nearly seven
times the pre-auction estimate. One cow sold for $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the proceeds will be used to build a permanent bronze
sculpture as a hometown tribute to Schulz, the creator of the comic
strip ''Peanuts.''

<HEADLINE> Spike Lee's Mom Was His Influence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Spike Lee says his mother was his biggest
influence. But it was a Super 8 camera that changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mom made me read Dickens and Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale
Hurston when I was 13,'' the director said in Sunday's editions of
The New York Post. ''When I was in college, she would send me back
my letters, correcting my grammar in red ink. She gave me high
standards, telling me 90 percent wasn't good enough. I had to be
twice as good as my white classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super 8 helped Lee choose his career path at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when I decided to become a filmmaker. I went all around
the city, shooting everything I could see,'' said Lee, 43.

<HEADLINE> Dr. David J. Lehman, former Broward legislator, dead at 84  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) - Dr. David J. Lehman, a former state
representative and a pioneer in drug education programs, has died.
He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Lehman's death Friday were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman served in the Legislature from 1974 to 1984. His passion
was medicine and his fight to keep children off drugs, his wife,
Patricia, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, Lehman founded Teen-age and Parental Alert,
one of the first drug education programs in the state school
system. He also created a South Florida drug hotline, which ran on
the radio between 1968 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was born in Newark, N.J. He served as a medical officer
in the Army during World War II, attaining the rank of major. He
spent another seven years as an active reserve in the service
before moving to Florida in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Virginia medical school
and finishing his military service, Lehman worked at Memorial
Hospital in Hollywood when it opened in 1953. At the time he was
one of only eight physicians on the staff of the hospital, which
had 100 beds, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's dream was to become a surgeon, but military service
interrupted his residency time and he eventually became an internal
medicine cardiologist, Patricia Lehman said. Although it remained a
disappointment, Lehman devoted himself to causes that he cared most
about, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just such a good man who really spent his life trying
to help the community,'' his wife said. .

<HEADLINE> Schumer tries to stop Trump casino plans for Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer is trying to
trump Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer wrote a letter asking the Bureau of Indian Affairs to
defuse any application billionaire developer Donald Trump may make
to create a casino in New York City, since it could draw gamblers
from a planned Catskills casino.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who owns three casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., said in
Tuesday's New York Post that if state and federal officials approve
a proposed Indian casino in Monticello, he will push for one on 100
acres (40 hectares) of undeveloped land he owns near the Hudson
River.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was casino gambling in Manhattan, Sullivan County
would not do as well with it,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said Tuesday he would be hesitant about such
a project outside of the Catskills or Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   Trump could not be reached for comment Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Report calls for two-tiered child protective investigations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An advocacy group for poor families says
state child protection agents investigate families too often and
should offer help more.
</P>
<P>
   The State Communities Aid Association report differs from other
critiques by drawing attention to cases that are investigated but
not substantiated. Two-thirds of nearly 145,500 claims in 1998 were
determined to be unfounded, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nine-one-one gets hundreds, thousands, millions of calls. They
don't send a cop out every time,'' said the report's author and the
group's president, Karen Schimke.
</P>
<P>
   Of the reports that are substantiated, an estimated 40 percent
are closed the same day, suggesting that families that needed
ongoing help didn't receive it, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for Child Protection Services to prioritize
cases through a two-tiered system, sending investigators to the
most potentially dangerous ones instead of conducting lengthy
investigations into every abuse or neglect complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The less threatening arm of the system would work best if it
used workers from community agencies instead of child-protection
offices, said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National
Coalition for Child Protection Reform.
</P>
<P>
   A two-tiered system, said Marno Batterson, a senior associate
with the Center for the Study of Social Policy, is ''a step in the
right direction. It's not foolproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Batterson headed the child-protection system in Iowa and helped
get a law passed in 1997 to switch its focus from investigating to
helping families. The push for the change came from a widely
publicized case in which the state put a mother on its child-abuse
registry because her mentally impaired son had wandered from the
house while she put another child to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new system is under scrutiny because a 2-year-old girl
whose case was under investigation was beaten to death in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public expects perfection, and it's not achievable,''
Batterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking a look at it, and we welcome anything that might
help us provide better service to the children and families of New
York,'' said Bill Van Slyke, spokesman for the Office of Children
and Family Services, which oversees Child Protection Services.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Review Pollard Case  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is awaiting an
administration recommendation on whether former Navy analyst
Jonathan Pollard, imprisoned for spying for Israel, should receive
clemency, Clinton's top aide said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, convicted in 1985, is serving a life term at a federal
prison in Butner, N.C., for providing Israel with thousands of
highly classified documents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on ''Fox News Sunday'' whether the Pollard case is
''actively under review,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta
said: ''I don't think there's anything in the offing there, but,
you know, it remains under review in the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is highly charged within the U.S. intelligence
establishment. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at a Maryland
retreat in October 1998 almost foundered when former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Clinton broke a promise to let
Pollard go to Israel with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had promised only to review the case. During
deliberations on clemency, CIA Director George Tenet had told
Clinton he would quit if Pollard were freed.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard's fate also has become an issue in first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign in New York, which has a large and
politically active Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Sunday that Hillary
Clinton has interest in the case but has taken no position on
clemency for Pollard. He confirmed a report in the New York Post
that Pollard's Canadian wife, Esther, has requested a meeting to
plead his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to discussing the invitation,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders in New York City told the first lady last month
that officials planned to transfer Pollard from Butner, where he is
incarcerated with nonviolent prisoners, to a maximum security
facility in Virginia. The Jewish leaders feared that racists or
anti-Semites among the inmates would pose a danger to Pollard
because of his religion.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, the day Hillary Clinton received Esther Pollard's
appeal for a meeting, Wolfson said ''she was concerned on
humanitarian grounds'' and interceded by having ''those concerns
conveyed to the appropriate authorities.'' He did not say whom she
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prison officials do not comment on an inmate's housing,
so it was unclear whether the reported move had occurred or was
still planned.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hillary Clinton, the Republican nominee, Rep. Rick Lazio,
has announced no position on clemency for Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta denied that President Clinton is considering a pardon to
help his wife's campaign. When a questioner suggested on CNN's
''Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields'' that a pardon before Election Day,
Nov. 7, might ''appear like crass pandering for the Jewish vote in
New York to help his wife,'' Podesta replied:
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to speculate about that. He's got no
recommendation. When we get one, we'll decide how it looks.''

<HEADLINE> Districts offered bonuses, high pay to lure teachers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - School officials hiring new teachers this
year had to act fast to snap up any applicants they liked.
</P>
<P>
   One Passaic County school chief said he lost three candidates
who took better-paying jobs before he could make the deals
official.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tighter supply of teachers nationwide, and New Jersey
districts resorted to signing bonuses and higher starting salaries
to fill their open teaching slots before the school year started.
</P>
<P>
   Morristown Superintendent Dwight Pfennig said he hired six
teachers this year with the help of $2,500 signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that people are playing salaries off each
other, and we hope this will give us a leg up,'' he told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The average New Jersey teacher makes more than $50,000 a year.
That's more than other teachers around the nation and draws many
candidates, sparing the state from the intense competition in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But districts across New Jersey are preparing for a high number
of retirements. Almost a third of the 90,000 teachers working are
either eligible for retirement or are within five years of
eligibility under state pension rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we are going to have an exodus of teachers, and my
concern is, where will the people be coming from and will we be
able to compete for them,'' said Edwina Lee, executive director of
the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the pay offered to teachers varies widely between
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's computer analysis of state teaching records
showed that wealthy suburban districts, not surprisingly, are
paying better than poor urban schools, while schools from northern
New Jersey pay better than those from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Valley Regional High Schools in Bergen County offered
the highest pay in the state. Teachers in their first or second
year at the schools in Old Tappan and Demarest generally earn more
than $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Township in Burlington County, teachers in the
100-student district who had 10 years of experience earned about
$37,000 last year. That's a smaller paycheck than what the typical
new teacher receives in the 40 districts with the highest salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The pay also varies among more experienced teachers higher up on
the salary scale.
</P>
<P>
   The scales determine how much teachers make each year, depending
on the advanced degrees and number of years of experience they
have. The salary guides are set during collective bargaining
between school boards and teacher unions.
</P>
<P>
   Until five years ago, the unions usually would determine salary
raises on the scale by divvying up a total amount agreed upon with
the local school board.
</P>
<P>
   But board members are getting more involved as they grow more
concerned about starting salaries. Some have complained that the
unions have directed raises toward upper portions of the salary
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Union County community of New Providence offered its
mid-career teachers about $55,000 last year and those at the top
end more than $83,000. But its starting pay was about $33,000, the
lowest in Union County and below the $40,000 offered in nearby
Westfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the point where, if we don't do something at the
bottom end, we will lose hires,'' said Superintendent Geoffrey
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   In Middlesex County, Spotswood boosted its starting pay from
$28,000 to $30,000 under a new contract ratified last year. It also
offered $3,000 signing bonuses for new science and math teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People might shrug that it's not much,'' said Superintendent
Anthony Vaz. ''But this is a competitive business and every little
bit helps.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Committed to Mideast Peace  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton remains committed to doing
everything possible to achieve peace between Israelis and
Palestinians, keeping in mind that ''nothing's agreed ... until
everything's agreed,'' his chief of staff said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the obstacles to Middle East peace as ''tough, tough
issues,'' White House chief John Podesta said, ''These are the most
fundamental issues about national identity, ... but (Clinton)
remains committed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to ... do everything we can to see if we can
bridge differences between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, appearing on ''Fox News Sunday,'' said the key to
success in the tempestuous region is taking ''the time to see if we
can work toward a comprehensive solution. The president's obviously
been at that for years but most intensely this summer at Camp
David.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the host at the presidential retreat in Maryland to
more than two weeks of talks in July between Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Despite
progress on many fronts, the talks broke apart on the most
difficult division between the two, sovereignty in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta spoke Sunday before the Central Committee of Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization, meeting in the Gaza Strip,
decided to back off his threat to declare unilaterally a
Palestinian state with its capital in the holy city. Israel had
threatened reprisals, and the Clinton administration had pressed
hard for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the decision, Barak told ABC's ''This Week'' from
New York, ''I think that it's a positive sign, but we still have to
have no illusions. We still have a lot of work to do if we want to
achieve peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides made concessions at Camp David, especially Barak, who
went much further than any predecessor toward sharing parts of
Jerusalem. An indication of the depth of feeling he aroused was the
pronouncement by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's widow Leah,
a strong backer of the peace process, that her husband was spinning
in his grave with revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta was asked whether Clinton had pushed Barak too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he's been pushed. I think what we're trying to
do is bridge the differences on very, very complicated issues, very
tough issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I think that he's been actually courageous in coming to
Camp David and exploring a variety of options. But nothing's
agreed, obviously, until everything's agreed. And the work
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Podesta said:
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton's meeting and handshake last week in New York with
Fidel Castro, which the Cuban president said was over in 20
seconds, was little more than a ''nothing moment, frankly'' at a
luncheon. ''We haven't changed our policy toward the Castro
government or toward Cuba,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   --Reports that Clinton is angry over a move in his home state,
Arkansas, to cancel his law license represent the ''cottage
industry in psychoanalyzing the president'' that has grown up. Will
Clinton ever practice law again? Said Podesta: ''I doubt that.''

<HEADLINE> Sharpton threatens boycott of Miami-based Burger King  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - The Rev. Al Sharpton said Sunday he will call for a
boycott of Burger King if the world's No.2 fast-food chain does not
discuss its attempt to revoke a black owner's franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also said he will call for the boycott if Burger King
does not agree to hire both a minority-owned investment firm to
handle a portion of its proposed stock offering and a
minority-owned advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he will go to New York's Wall Street on Monday to
announce a five-day countdown to the boycott, which would begin
against the Miami-based company on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Burger King is pulling a whopper over the black community,''
Sharpton said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that minority communities spend millions of
dollars annually at Burger King. It is unfair that minority
advertising agencies and investment firms do not get a cut of the
company's business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of a pattern of racism'' by Burger King, Sharpton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials would not comment Sunday on Sharpton's
proposed boycott, but spokeswoman Kim Miller denied race plays any
part in the company's dealings with franchise owner La-Van Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, two of the company's three advertising agencies
are minority-owned. She had no knowledge of what investment firms
have been contacted to handle the stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between Burger King and Sharpton centers on Hawkins,
a Detroit restaurant owner.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, the owner of 27 inner-city Burger King restaurants
nationwide, filed a $500 million suit against Burger King on April
14. He alleges that the company used him as a pawn because of his
race and pulled out of a deal to jointly open 225 inner-city
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King countersued on April 19. It wants Hawkins to return
their property and says he owes it more than $6.5 million from a
loan given in 1998. Hawkins has also been sued by suppliers who say
he has not paid his bills.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Burger King's previous CEO, Dennis Malamatinas,
promised to sit down with him and his group, the National Action
Network, to discuss the company's concerns about Hawkins. But he
left the company last month and the company has not met with him,
Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hawkins' deal with Burger King was announced in 1996, the
ceremony was at the White House and hailed as an example of black
entrepreneurship
</P>
<P>
   ''Burger King is trying to have it both ways. When they could
get some positive (public relations) out of the situation, this was
a minority deal,'' Sharpton said. ''Now, it's not a minority
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Burger King's dealings with Hawkins have been
''strictly business.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that they offered Hawkins a settlement offer last
month, but he rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the merits of our case, we believe we will prevail in
court,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible boycott adds to Burger King's recent troubles.
Parent company Diageo PLC, a European conglomerate, is looking to
spin off 20 percent of Burger King, which has angered independent
franchise operators.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim groups are also boycotting Burger King. They oppose the
operation of a restaurant in a Jewish West Bank settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said other minority organizations were going to support
the boycott, but he would not name them.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he expects the company to fold rather than face a
boycott, adding Burger King ''does not need this during the middle
of its initial public offering,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers End Their Blockades  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Blockades at France's oil refineries and depots
were lifted Sunday and tankers began refilling service stations
after six days of protests against high taxes paralyzed fuel
distribution and stalled planes, trains and motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said that truckers and farmers in western
France had removed their seven holdout blockades by early Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fuel tankers can begin making deliveries,'' said Pierre
Navaro, a ministry spokesman. ''We can begin restocking
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry gave heavy vehicles permission to drive
in France on Sunday to expedite fuel deliveries. Trucks are
normally barred from French roads on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of blockades and the onset of fuel distribution,
however, was not expected to immediately ease the plight of
motorists, who were still lined up bumper-to-bumper at service
stations around France. LCI television reported that in the
southern city of Marseille, 60 percent of service stations remained
dry Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as OPEC members meeting in Vienna, Austria, agreed
Sunday to boost the group's official oil output by 800,000 barrels
a day. The decision came amid mounting international pressure on
OPEC to pump more oil to stem surging fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   But as protests wound down in France, unrest in neighboring
European countries appeared to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, thousands of truckers, taxi drivers and tour bus
operators took to the streets to push the government to reconsider
a lowering of fuel taxes or a tax exemption for the transportation
industry.
</P>
<P>
   British truckers blocked several refineries and gas stations,
causing nationwide shortages. About 100 Shell stations ran out of
fuel because of the protest at a huge Shell refinery in northeast
England.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not critical by any means but it is getting worse. If
these actions continue into the early part of next week there will
be severe difficulties,'' said Roy Holloway, director of the Petrol
Retailers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the north German city of Hildesheim, a national truckers'
group warned the government that the industry's mood is
''aggressive'' and that high fuel costs could spark large-scale
protests, Focus magazine reported in editions to go on newsstands
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In France, truckers and farmers began lifting blockades on
Saturday after union leaders unanimously called for an end to the
protest, which began last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Road Transport, the country's largest
truckers union, accepted the government's offer on Friday, as did a
smaller union. The last holdout, France's second-largest truckers'
group UNOSTRA, accepted the deal Saturday and joined two
agriculture unions in calls to lift blockades from more than 160
oil refineries and fuel depots around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that joined the protests -- including ambulance
drivers and taxi drivers -- won a variety of concessions from
France's leftist government.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Laurent Fabius said Sunday that the total
impact of tax concessions made to truckers would cost the
government about $405 million over 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers were offered a 20-cent reimbursement per gallon of fuel
this year, and a 14-cent refund per gallon on gasoline taxes next
year. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, under pressure from Green Party
members of his coalition, vowed that no further concessions would
be made.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers were offered a 30 percent decrease in gasoline taxes for
the year 2000, said Luc Guyau, president of the National Federation
of Agricultural Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi drivers were given the go-ahead to raise their fares by 4.5
percent starting next month to cover the rising cost of fuel,
FranceInfo radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blockades caused disruptions at some airports and on
high-speed trains. Many local governments began rationing gasoline
to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Nice-Cote d'Azur airport said that flights had returned to
normal on Sunday after cancellations and delays during the week due
to lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel fuel in France costs $2.84 per gallon, nearly twice the
price of such fuel in the United States. Fuel prices here have
jumped about 40 percent in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Yale professor says armed society is safer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Yale University Professor John Lott is
used to academic research drawing little attention, so he was
astonished to find his work has put him in the crossfire of a
national debate over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has written a book, ''More Guns, Less Crime,'' in which he
argues that when law-abiding citi-zens are allowed to carry
handguns, violent crime is reduced because criminals fear their
potential victims may be armed. Since the book was published in
1998 and updated this summer, Lott has become the darling of
gun-rights supporters and a pariah to gun-control proponents.
</P>
<P>
   He has been featured on CNN, NBC, MSNBC and on the Fox News
network, as well as being the subject of stories in Time Magazine
and the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, an economics professor and senior research scholar at the
Yale Law School since August 1999, said he is surprised at the
reaction the book and the earlier study it was based on has drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no conception of what kind of attention it would
generate,'' Lott said. ''I've written over 80 academic articles and
with the vast majority of research you do, you're lucky if you get
10 people who read your papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months of the study being published in 1996 on the
University of Chicago's Web site, where he was teaching at the
time, Lott said it was downloaded 45,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   The updated study examines crime in 23 states that passed or
altered their ''right to carry'' or ''concealed carry'' gun laws
between 1977 and 1996. A total of 3,100 counties were examined,
including counties that don't allow citizens to carry pistols, but
neighboring counties that do.
</P>
<P>
   Some form of concealed-carry involving pistols is legal in 43
states, including Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lott's research, between 1977 and 1992 violent
crime significantly dropped in counties that adopted concealed
weapons laws. The murder rate dipped 7.7 percent, rape was down 5.3
percent, aggravated assault was down 7.1 percent and robbery
dropped 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was a corresponding increase in property crime.
Burglaries were up .5 percent, larceny 3.3 percent and auto theft
increased 7.1 percent. Lott attributes the increase in nonviolent
crimes to criminals avoiding the risk of encountering armed
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control spokesman Brian Morton said he's never read
Lott's book, but that experts have thoroughly discredited his
research.
</P>
<P>
   ''He likes to say that allowing people to carry concealed
weapons drives crime down, but the fact is, crime's going down
everywhere all over the country, but it's going down faster in
states that don't have CCW laws,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mike Lawlor, an East Haven Democrat who has
co-authored some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, contends
that despite covering 3,100 counties over a 20-year period, Lott is
''extrapolating from a few isolated locations'' and uses misleading
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlor cites far lower crime rates in Canada and England, where
gun laws are far stricter than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''If more people carrying guns lawfully meant lower violent
crime rates, the United States would have the lowest crime rates in
the world,'' Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lott said, ''hot burglaries'' - incidents where
burglars enter occupied homes, are more common in England than in
the United States because English homeowners are far less likely to
be armed.
</P>
<P>
   Lott noted that while murders receive big coverage, incidents in
which law-abiding citizens shoot criminals to thwart crimes are
rarely reported. Lott also believes guns are the best defense for
women who are often attacked by male assailants who outweigh them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guns can make it easier for bad things to happen, but they can
also make it easier to stop bad things and protect people,'' Lott
said. ''My research indicates that police are the single most
important factor for reducing crime, but police simply can't be
there all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Says It Killed 70 Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Backed by MiG-27 warplanes, Sri Lankan
government forces destroyed 14 rebel bunkers close to northern
Jaffna city on Sunday, killing 70 guerrillas and losing 12
soldiers, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second big offensive in the past week -- part of a new
push to secure military positions around Jaffna ahead of the Oct.
10 parliamentary elections, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the rebels will try to disrupt voting in
Jaffna city and other places.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, which has been fighting for a separate homeland for the
Tamil minority since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's assault dislodged the rebels from their positions five
to 10 miles east of Jaffna, a former guerrilla stronghold, said
Brig. Sanath Karunaratne, the spokesman. The air force and the navy
destroyed four rebel boats, which tried to bring in reinforcements.
Sixty-two soldiers were wounded in the attack that cut off a vital
rebel supply route, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, military clashes with rebels resulted in 300 deaths
on both sides in fighting that lasted two days.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, a parliamentary hopeful from the ruling party was
shot dead by unidentified assailants, becoming the first candidate
to be killed ahead of Sri Lanka's elections. A supporter was also
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Cheliyan Perimpanayakam and his supporter, Manoharan Pillai,
were killed at Pillai's home in Kalmunai, about 130 miles east of
the capital, Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   Both were members of the minority Tamil community and supporters
of President Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials would not say whether they suspected Tamil Tiger
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the Tamil community supports the separatist
movement. Opponents often are targeted by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A record 5,000 candidates from 29 political parties are running
for 225 seats as the military keeps up a 17-year military battle
with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 62,400 people have been killed in the 17-year civil
war in Sri Lanka, an Indian Ocean island nation near India.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan government announced Sunday it has spent $18
million on six new attack vessels to boost its naval power in its
war against the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers accuses the majority Sinhalese, who control the
government and the military, of widespread discrimination against
the minority Tamils in education and jobs. The government denies
the charge.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The Watcher,'' a thriller about a serial
killer tracking an FBI agent, slew the competition at the weekend
box office but wasn't enough to keep movie revenue from falling
behind last year's record pace.
</P>
<P>
   The thriller starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa
Tomei grossed $9.1 million Friday through Sunday, according to box
office estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Another new release, the dark comedy ''Nurse Betty'' with Morgan
Freeman and Renee Zellweger, opened strong with a $7.3 million
gross. It had the weekend's top per-screen average for films in
wide distribution, averaging $5,003 on 1,459 screens.
</P>
<P>
   The re-issue of ''This Is Spinal Tap'' was the top grossing film
in revenue per screen, averaging $5,400 in just 10 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's top film, the cheerleading flick ''Bring It On,''
dropped to No. 3, taking in $6.5 million on 2,416 screens.
</P>
<P>
   This was the seventh straight weekend that total gross revenue
was less than the previous year. Until this weekend, however, box
office receipts for the year were slightly ahead of 1999, said Paul
Dergarabedian of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., a box office
tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lower receipts, this has been the second most
successful summer on record for Hollywood. Film revenue was $2.73
billion during the Memorial Day to Labor Day period, compared to
about $3 billion for last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The industry could still match or exceed last year's record of
$7.5 billion gross revenue depending on the success of holiday
releases, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   Potential blockbusters scheduled to open this fall include ''102
Dalmatians,'' ''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' and
''Unbreakable,'' which re-teams Bruce Willis with ''The Sixth
Sense'' creator M. Night Shyamalan.
</P>
<P>
   ''All it takes is one or two big films to turn everything
around,'' Dergarabedian said. ''I wouldn't write this year off
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations (final figures
to be released Monday):
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Watcher,'' $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Nurse Betty,'' $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Bring It On,'' $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Cell,'' $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Space Cowboys,'' $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''The Original Kings of Comedy,'' $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Art of War,'' $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''The Way of the Gun,'' $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Highlander: Endgame,'' $1.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Delay Statehood  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- In a bid to give faltering peace
talks a chance -- and perhaps a final one -- a Palestinian ruling
body honored Yasser Arafat's wishes Sunday and delayed yet again
the long-postponed declaration of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The move gave a new lease on life to the delicate and troubled
peace process with Israel, but it might be a short one. All sides
reported there was still no breakthrough in sight over the
heart-wrenching issue of Jerusalem, and specifically of sovereignty
over sites holy to both Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Central Council's decision came after two days
of long-awaited debate, although it had been clear throughout that
they would put off a Sept. 13 date set for the declaration. Arafat
had been under intense international pressure not to make a
unilateral move that could damage peace talks and possibly provoke
violent conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel immediately hailed the decision. In New York, where Prime
Minister Ehud Barak is traveling, his spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky,
called the move ''a positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, speaking from New York just before the vote in an
interview with ABC, said the likely delay was ''a positive sign,
but we still have to have no illusions. We still have a lot of work
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ''in a way, it's now or never,'' Barak hinted at new
leeway over the issue at the center of the deadlock. He suggested
he was ready to accept less than full Israeli sovereignty over the
Temple Mount -- known to Muslims as the Haram as-Sharif -- the holy
site in Jerusalem's Old City revered by Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the Palestinian decision to delay a statehood
declaration were deliberately vague. Officials didn't want to fall
again into the trap of naming a date, then having to pull back from
it. But it appeared statehood had been put off by at least two
months, until Nov. 15, and perhaps longer.
</P>
<P>
   The council will reconvene by Nov. 15 -- the anniversary of the
1988 declaration of statehood made by Arafat from exile in Algiers,
Algeria -- to discuss when to declare statehood, said Salim Zanoun,
chairman of the 129-member council.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Palestinians will work on state-building
measures, such as preparing a constitution, setting up legislative
and presidential elections, and working on applying for Palestinian
membership in the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the PLO Executive
Committee, an 18-member body led by Arafat, would recommend the
proper date to declare statehood, and the council would then
consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision gives the peace process a brilliant chance,''
Erekat said. ''I hope now that the intensive negotiations will take
their due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said second-tier negotiations due to begin soon in
the region would go into high gear for the next five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides acknowledged the task remained daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main problem remains, and that is sovereignty over
Jerusalem,'' said Cabinet Minister Nabil Shaath. ''No Palestinian
leader can sacrifice sovereignty over Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who has said only for or five weeks remained to forge a
treaty, told ABC This Week that Arafat ''has to move'' in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 13 date was set last year by Arafat and Barak as the
deadline for a final peace accord between their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat dearly wants to realize his lifelong dream of declaring
statehood for his people. But he knows that a state without Israeli
approval would encounter huge if not insurmountable obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders have warned Arafat that a state declared
unilaterally would receive little support. And Israel had
threatened ''countermeasures'' in such an event, which could have
included annexing parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Arafat were to delay statehood too long, he could
suffer huge damage to his credibility among ordinary Palestinians,
who share his dream.
</P>
<P>
   On the sun-baked streets of Gaza Sunday, Palestinians seemed
frustrated at the constant delays, yet resigned to the need for
another one. They said they knew that a state declared unilaterally
would be cut off from Israel, Gaza's economic lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beautiful to have an independent state,'' mused Rana
Muhammed, a 20-year-old pharmacology student, gazing at sequined
evening gowns in a shop window during an afternoon stroll. ''But
the question is what kind of state -- can we live with it? Our
economy is totally dependent on Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby cafe, security agent Mohammed Sa'afin paused from an
afternoon card game. ''This is a bid to win some more time,'' he
said. But he added: ''If they delay it after this one ... the
Palestinian people will not wait forever. They will snatch these
rights with their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A retiree, Elsoh Kamil, interrupted angrily. ''It's nothing but
talk,'' he said. ''We've never gotten anything from the Jews.
Statehood by the end of the year? I don't believe it. In 100 years,
things will be the same for us.''

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Hormones Benefit  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A Dutch study of more than 2,000 women bolsters
research suggesting that hormone supplements taken in menopause
have cardiovascular benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with subjects who never used estrogen and progestin,
women who took those hormone supplements for at least a year had a
47 percent lower risk of peripheral artery disease, or hardening of
the arteries in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Peripheral artery disease affects 8 million Americans, including
5 percent of the over-50 population, according to the Society of
Cardiovascular &AMP; Interventional Radiology.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered a marker for heart disease in older people
because most who have it also have coronary atherosclerosis, or
thickening in the arteries to the heart, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a
spokeswoman for the American Heart Association and a San Francisco
cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch findings suggest that the benefits remain after women
stop using hormones, according to the study in Monday's Archives of
Internal Medicine, an American Medical Association publication.
</P>
<P>
   Lead researcher Dr. Iris C.D. Westendorp of Erasmus University
in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and colleagues said the results could
have important implications for a disease that is becoming more
prevalent as the population ages.
</P>
<P>
   However, they noted that other research has suggested that
healthier women are more likely to use hormones and the
supplements' supposed benefits are due more to ''preexisting
characteristics'' of the users.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot exclude the possibility that some (or the whole) of
our findings are based on this selection bias,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hormones have long been believed to lower the risk of heart
attack by improving cholesterol levels, though recent research
suggests there is no protective effect in users who already have
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. researchers hope their ongoing Women's Health Initiative --
a nationwide study comparing effects of hormones with a placebo --
will clear up the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Dutch study was well done, its findings cannot be
considered conclusive until completion of randomized studies like
the Women's Health Initiative, Redberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch study involved 2,196 women ages 55 to 80 living near
Rotterdam. Hormone treatment for up to more than 15 years, with
either estrogen alone or with progestin, was reported by 351 women.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 351 women, 34 had peripheral arterial disease. That
compared with disease diagnosed in 247 of the 1,837 women who
didn't use hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, hormone users had a 30 percent lower risk of arterial
disease, though use for less than a year wasn't associated with a
protective effect.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller in middle of state Senate race snafu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - State Comptroller H. Carl McCall hasn't
endorsed a candidate in the Democratic primary race for a western
New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   But an ad for 57th Senate District incumbent Al Coppola says he
has. The ad that ran in the Challenger, a weekly newspaper popular
with the African-American community in the Buffalo area, shows
McCall and Coppola standing with other prominent black leaders.
Text below indicates McCall has endorsed Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is simply wrong,'' McCall said after Coppola's opponent,
Byron Brown, objected to the ad. ''I have not endorsed anyone in
the primary for State Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, seen as a potential Democratic candidate for governor in
2002, endorsed Coppola last March in a special election but said
the gesture did not extend to the regular election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have pointedly chosen not to endorse either candidate during
the primary,'' McCall said. ''Both candidates are good Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall raised the ire of some Democrats in May when he did not
back Syracuse Democratic Assemblyman Michael Bragman's attempt to
overthrow Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.

<HEADLINE> 'West Wing,' 'Sopranos' After Award  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC's political drama ''The West Wing'' and
HBO's mob series ''The Sopranos'' headed into a skirmish at the
52nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The two series were competing directly in six categories,
including best drama series. ''The West Wing'' started with an
edge: four Emmy awards it received in craft categories last month.
</P>
<P>
   Top comedy nominees included ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' ''Everybody Loves
Raymond'' and ''Sex and the City.'' Awards in 27 categories were to
be given during the three-hour ceremony airing on ABC with host
Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   Among networks, NBC was the leading nominee with 95 bids. It was
followed by HBO with 86, ABC with 65, CBS with 42 and Fox with 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences ceremony was being
broadcast internationally and carried live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   In last month's creative arts ceremony, Emmy awards were
announced in 53 craft categories including outstanding
choreography, editing and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Four acting awards for guest roles were among those given out.
Bruce Willis was honored as outstanding guest actor in a comedy
series for his appearance on ''Friends,'' while Jean Smart was
named in the matching actress category for a turn on ''Frasier.''
Two veteran actors, James Whitmore and Beah Richards, received
trophies for appearances on the legal drama ''The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   For best commercial, the award went to Nike's ''The Morning
After.''

<HEADLINE> Girls soccer game turns into parent brawl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - A tied soccer game between 8- and
9-year-old girls ended in a brawl among their parents Sunday after
a disagreement over where a coach was standing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The argument began in Sondek Park about 4 p.m. after the two
teams, one from Staten Island, N.Y., and the other from North
Hunterdon, were tied at the end of regulation play, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A shootout was to take place between the teams, but before it
could, a Staten Island coach argued that a North Hunterdon coach
should not be permitted to stand behind the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The argument escalated into a fistfight with as many as a dozen
parents and coaches involved. No children were involved in the
brawl, according to South Brunswick police Officer Jim Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Police said even after they arrived, parents were still yelling
at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said a coach and a parent claimed to have been assaulted,
but no one was injured seriously or arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were escorted from the field, and neither was
declared the game winner, Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Governor signs presidential vote bill, court action threatened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - Puerto Rico's governor on Sunday
signed a law allowing islanders to cast ballots in U.S.
presidential elections, although it was unclear whether their votes
would actually count.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello said in a statement the bill gave residents
of the U.S. territory the opportunity ''to make their voices heard,
along with their genuine desire to participate fully in the
approaching democratic processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Local legislators approved the bill last week following a U.S.
District Court ruling that Puerto Ricans have the right to vote for
president. Judge Jaime Pieras ordered the local government to
prepare presidential ballots for the upcoming Nov. 7 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling challenges Puerto Rico's peculiar relationship with
the United States, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but do not
vote for president and have only a non-voting delegate in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The law adds a fourth ballot to the elections for legislature,
governor and municipal posts. About 2.4 million of Puerto Rico's
3.8 million people are registered to vote, and the island typically
has a voter turnout of more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the new law has been largely ignored in Washington, it has
created a storm within Puerto Rico. Pro-independence activists and
supporters of the current commonwealth arrangement fear the law is
a step toward making the island the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Martin, vice president of the Puerto Rican Independence
Party, said statehood opponents would challenge the bill in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our opinion this is an unconstitutional bill,'' Martin
said. He argued all changes to the U.S.-Puerto Rico relationship
must be put to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-commonwealth gubernatorial candidate Sila Calderon called
the vote ''a deception,'' saying she believes a higher court will
overturn Pieras' ruling. She said she would not be voting for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony until the United States won it
in 1898 Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens
under the Jones Act of 1917 and were ruled by a governor designated
by the United States until 1952.

<HEADLINE> Giants 10, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds and Ellis Burks each drove in
two runs in a five-run first inning, and the San Francisco Giants
beat the San Diego Padres 10-2 Sunday to stop their two-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter (10-9) threw a five-hit ball for seven innings to
win his second consecutive decision for the first time since
winning four decisions in a row from June 9 to July 1.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first Giants left-hander since Mike McCormick
(1958-61) to win 10 or more games in four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Witasick (3-2) lost for the first time in five starts since
Aug. 14 against Atlanta, allowing seven runs, eight hits and four
walks in 5 1-3 innings. He struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Damon Minor hit a three-run homer in the seventh
off Todd Erdos for his first major league hit.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which had lost two straight following an
eight-game winning streak, hasn't lost three straight since Aug.
11-13 at New York. The Giants began the day 6&AMP;frac12; games of
second-place Arizona in the NL West,
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco went ahead in the first on Bonds' two-run triple,
an error by shortstop Desi Relaford on Jeff Kent's grounder and
Burks' 23rd homer, his ninth since Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, J.T. Snow hit his 14th sacrifice fly, setting an
NL record for left-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko doubled and eventually scored on Eric Owens'
sacrifice fly in the fourth, but Marvin Benard homered leading off
the bottom half, his first in 85 at-bats since Aug. 15, for a 7-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Greg LaRocca got his first major league RBI in the
seventh with a single. Later in the inning, Owens singled and tried
to stretch it to a double, only to find Ed Sprague holding at
second. Owens then was thrown out trying to return to first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bonds moved into a ninth-place tie with Tito Fuentes on the
San Francisco career triples list at 33. Bobby Bonds had 42 and is
third overall. ... The Giants are 4-1-1 in four-game series this
year. ... Padres 3B Phil Nevin, who has not played since Wednesday
due to a strained lower abdominal, will have his status evaluated
in San Diego on Monday. ... Snow had never hit more than seven
sacrifice flies (1997, 1998) in any previous season . ... Witasick
has allowed seven runs or more in four starts this season,
including one with Kansas City.

<HEADLINE> Rebels: Too Dangerous for Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEBU, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels warned negotiators Sunday
to stay away from their jungle camp, saying it was too dangerous to
hold talks on the release of two French hostages after a clash
between rival guerrilla factions the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said flaring tensions among factions of the Abu
Sayyaf rebels, who say they are fighting for an independent Islamic
state, mean it will probably take at least five days to free the
two journalists. The two were not released Saturday with four other
European hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Ghalib ''Robot'' Andang called a negotiator and
said he planned to retaliate against the faction that attacked a
caravan of vehicles Saturday in which he and two go-betweens were
riding.
</P>
<P>
   The go-betweens were not injured, but at least one of their
bodyguards was killed and eight others in the entourage were
injured, negotiators said. Many civilians were also injured in the
cross fire, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is still quite unstable,'' chief negotiator
Robert Aventajado said. ''Robot needs to recover his confidence
about the security of himself and also some of his people,
including the safety of the French journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The military has reported rising tensions among the Abu Sayyaf
over the division of millions of dollars paid for the release of
other hostages seized April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan diving
resort.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing two Finns, a French and a German on Saturday,
the rebels are still holding the two French journalists, 12
Filipino Christian evangelists, and a Filipino who worked at
Sipadan at camps on southern Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   A separate rebel faction is holding an American Muslim, Jeffrey
Schilling, who was abducted Aug. 28 when he visited their camp.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be Schilling's first public statement, a
rebel spokesman played a tape in a radio interview that he said was
a recording of the American's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I am kept in either chains or handcuffs, I am not
mistreated,'' said the tape, broadcast over the Radio Mindanao
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their negotiators are ready to compromise on their part. Use
the Libyan government as negotiators and end my captivity as soon
as possible,'' the tape said.
</P>
<P>
   The man identified as Schilling said the rebels had abducted him
because they believed he was a CIA agent. ''It's absolutely false.
It's based on a misunderstanding due to my knowledge of the CIA's
past policies in the 1980s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four released Europeans spent the day Sunday relaxing at a
Philippine resort hotel as they waited for a Libyan plane that will
take them to Tripoli for celebrations of their release. The delayed
plane finally took off Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Loisy of France donned a diving suit and went scuba
diving for the first time since the group was abducted from the
Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice. It feels like freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   German Marc Wallert, 27, the youngest hostage, smiled as he read
newspapers with his photo on the front page. Finns Risto Vahanen
and Seppo Franti toasted repeatedly with glasses of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had a lot of time to consider our lives, consider our
values,'' Vahanen said. ''I think our lives will be changed after
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Franti, who was quoted in a pool press report Saturday as saying
he didn't want to go to Libya, held a news conference Sunday to
express appreciation for Libya's help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking forward to the celebration in Tripoli,'' he
said.

<P>
   Libya played a leading role in the negotiations, paying $1
million for the freedom of each of the hostages, negotiators said.
An earlier group of six released hostages also flew to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya has resisted paying for the French journalists still
in captivity, saying their company should foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Libya insists the money is going for development projects, not
into the pockets of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But the released hostages said they saw signs of money flooding
into the rebel camp.

   ''The Abu Sayyaf have been presenting their new clothes, their
golden jewelry, we know that they have bought speedboats and
motorcycles and so on,'' Vahanen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Philippines should learn from the abductions that it
''can't neglect remote areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to give similar chances to all people, no matter
what their religion, no matter where they live,'' he said. ''What
we saw in Jolo was real poverty, and this kind of poverty is always
the seed of this kind of guerrilla movement.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie Barry Zito pitched a five-hitter
to give Oakland its second straight shutout as the Athletics beat
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 11-0 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zito (4-3) followed up Tim Hudson's two-hitter in a 10-0 win
with a brilliant performance of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Zito struck out seven, walked none and allowed only one runner
to reach second base. The rookie left-hander hadn't pitched more
than seven innings in his previous nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland has gotten three straight complete games -- including a
2-0 loss by Gil Heredia on Friday -- for the first time since 1984.
The A's had only four complete games in their 138 games.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which began the day two games behind Seattle in the AL
West, also moved within two of Cleveland in the wild card race. The
Indians were rained out against Chicago on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde hit a solo homer, his 10th, in the fourth inning
against Paul Wilson (0-3). The A's then broke it open with six runs
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long and Jason Giambi had two-run singles, and Ben
Grieve and Adam Piatt added RBI singles in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez added a solo homer in the sixth, his 21st, and
Jeremy Giambi hit a two-run single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson gave up seven runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings.
Notes: Bill Krueger, Larry Sorensen Steve McCatty pitched
consecutive complete games for Oakland in 1984. ... Tampa Bay
pitchers have given up eight home runs in the last two games. ...
Devil Rays CF Gerald Williams needs two more RBIs to become only
the ninth player to have at least 20 home runs and 80 RBI in a
season from the leadoff spot. ... Wilson, a former No. 1 draft
choice of the New York Mets whose career has been dogged by
injuries, hasn't won in the majors since Sept. 20, 1996 when he
defeated Philadelphia. ... Oakland has scored 36 runs in Zito's
four victories but just 10 in his three losses. ... The A's have
committed 125 errors this season, compared to 122 all last season.
... Oakland has hit 209 home runs this year, third-most in
franchise history. The record is 243 in 1996. The A's hit 235 in
1999.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. man who saved teen-ager to be featured on TV show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA, N.Y. (AP) - The man who saved a teen-ager stuck on
railroad tracks as a train approached four years ago will be
featured on a national television show Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Egan was a college student in Ohio in 1996 when he
came upon a minor accident near some railroad tracks. William
Ferrell, then 19, had suffered an epileptic seizure and blacked
out.
</P>
<P>
   As Egan watched, the car crossed through an intersection, jumped
a curb and stopped on the tracks, Ferrell still slumped over the
wheel. With a train approaching, Egan ran to the car and tried
unsuccessfully to open the front door to put the car in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Egan lifted Ferrell out of the car but lost his
balance and fell against the car. The train's engineer tried to
stop the train but it struck the car. The car didn't move and
neither man was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Egan never met Ferrell until this year when they filmed the
segment for ''Courage,'' a Fox Family Channel show hosted by Danny
Glover. It will air at 9 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't consider myself a hero,'' Egan said. ''I think it's
the way my father raised me.''

<HEADLINE> Colombians March for Peace  </HEADLINE>
By CESAR GARCIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thousands of Colombians waving white
flags poured through the streets of Bogota Sunday to call for an
end to decades of fighting between the government and rebel groups,
a conflict that has claimed nearly 1,400 civilian lives so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The march, which filled an avenue of the capital and wound
through the center of the city, came as peace talks between the two
sides have stalled, and as the United States is pumping $1.3
billion in mostly military aid to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders and union chiefs, politicians and average
citizens marched together in an event organized by some 200 civic
groups. Unofficial crowd estimates ranged from 10,000 to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sick of the violence,'' said Eugenio Marulanda,
president of Colombia's chambers of commerce. ''We are a kidnapped
country. A murdered country. A bloodied country.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the more than three-decade-old war between
leftist rebels and the government, Colombia has one of the highest
murder and kidnapping rates in the world. Right-wing paramilitary
squads are also murdering more and more suspected sympathizers of
the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the
FARC, and the National Liberation Army, called the ELN.
</P>
<P>
   In the first eight months of this year, 1,389 civilians have
been massacred by either the two main rebel armies or the
paramilitary squads, according to the government human rights
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''No more FARC, no more ELN, no to kidnapping, yes to life,''
read a sign held by Stella Cortes, an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marchers were children who carried large photos of
their fathers who are soldiers or police and are being held captive
by the FARC, the larger of the rebel groups. It currently holds
more than 500 security-force members captive and has offered to
free them in exchange for the release of rebels held prisoner by
the government. The government of President Andres Pastrana has
refused.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, a newspaper quoted a FARC leader as prediciting
that the U.S.-backed Plan Colombia would result in thousands more
people killed and spur massive migrations to neighboring countries.
The U.S. and Colombian governments say the plan is aimed at seizing
the country's drug-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is actually aimed at stamping out ''political and
social opposition groups,'' like FARC, Ruben Zamora was quoted in
Sunday's editions of El Universal as saying
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, which earns millions of dollars a week in protecting
and taxing producers of cocaine and heroin in Colombia, has vowed
to combat the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Sunday's march, Felipe Rincon, a member of the
FARC peace negotiating team, said ''peace is not just the silencing
of the rifles.'' In a telephone interview, Rincon accused the
government of denying rights to work, health, education and housing
to many Colombians, and called the U.S.-backed offensive ''a plan
for war.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Hints at Peace Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested
Sunday he would consider less than full Israeli sovereignty over
the key holy site in Jerusalem's Old City revered by Muslims and
Jews, in a bid to keep alive hopes for a peace treaty with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches and interviews, Barak also outlined a solution for
sharing the disputed city that appeared to go beyond what Israel
has offered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to the Palestinians, he reminded them of the
benefits of a peace treaty, including the establishment of a widely
recognized Palestinian state and a massive international aid
package for Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ''has to move,'' Barak told ABC
This Week. ''In a way, it's now or never.'' Barak has said only
four or five weeks remained to forge a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak spoke, the top Palestinian policy-making body decided
to put off a declaration of statehood for at least two months, in a
bid to give faltering peace talks a chance. The decision, taken in
Gaza City with Arafat in attendance, defused possible confrontation
with Israel, which had threatened retaliation for a possible
unilateral move.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks have been stalled because of rival sovereignty
claims to a 36-acre sacred compound in Jerusalem's Old City. It is
known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the biblical Temples,
and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, with two
major mosques marking the spot where in Muslim tradition the
Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have insisted on full sovereignty over
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its
holy sites. Israel has rejected the demand, but has said it was
ready to hand over some parts of the eastern sector to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak suggested Sunday that while he would not agree to
Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount, he would not
necessarily insist on formal Israeli rule there, either. ''Somehow,
a formula should be found that would not contradict both
statements,'' he said, referring to rival sovereignty claims.
</P>
<P>
   In listing areas in east Jerusalem that must remain under
Israeli sovereignty, he mentioned the Western Wall -- a Temple
remnant that runs along the mosque compound -- but not the Temple
Mount itself.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing American Jewish leaders, Barak outlined in greatest
detail yet how he envisioned sharing east Jerusalem. Israel would
annex three major West Bank settlements near the city, as well as
11 Jewish neighborhoods built in east Jerusalem after Israel
captured the sector in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Israel would seek sovereignity over the Western Wall, the Mount
of Olives with its large Jewish cemetery, the City of David
archaeological site, ''and all other places that are important to
us,'' Barak told the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations on the last day of his weeklong New York visit.
</P>
<P>
   He made no reference to seeking sovereignty over the Palestinian
neighborhoods in east Jerusalem that are home to more than 200,000
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Nabil Aburdeneh turned down Barak's ideas, saying
the Palestinians would not accept Israeli sovereignty over any part
of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   However, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath confirmed for the
first time Sunday that in his meeting with President Clinton last
week, Arafat raised his own compromise proposal concerning the
Haram as-Sharif mosque compound.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told Clinton he was ready to accept Islamic sovereignty
by the countries of the Jerusalem Committee, including Egypt,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, over the site, with the
Palestinians receiving actual jurisdiction. ''The first reaction of
President Clinton was not encouraging,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said last week that lower-level
negotiations were to resume Sunday. However, Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said he was told by his Israeli counterpart, Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, that talks would not begin until after
Barak's return to Israel on Monday.

<HEADLINE> FTC: Show Industry Markets Violence  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The entertainment industry routinely markets
to young people violent movies, video games and music, ignoring its
own rating guidelines for age-sensitive material, federal
regulators say in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be released Monday by the Federal Trade
Commission, offers a tough indictment of the industry's practices.
It cites the use of a broad range of advertising and marketing to
reach youths with products rated for adults, according to sources
familiar with the report's contents.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are derived in part from documents submitted by
the industry itself, including marketing plans that demonstrate the
efforts of companies to advertise to young audiences materials
designated for adults, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the movie and video game industries have age-based rating
code systems. Films rated R, for example, require an adult to
accompany children under 17. Video games have their own code that
includes an ''M'' rating indicating the product is intended for
mature audiences ages 17 and older. The recording industry has a
more general label that warns of explicit content in music.
</P>
<P>
   FTC spokesman Eric London declined to comment on specifics of
the report, the product of a yearlong investigation ordered by
President Clinton. He said the study would be noteworthy for ''the
light that it sheds on how this kind of entertainment material is
marketed by the industry itself,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes a survey of marketing practices and found
most of the R-rated films and M-rated video games surveyed included
promotional efforts targeting underage audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not suggest legislation. The FTC does seek more
effective self-regulation of marketing practices by content makers
and enforcement of rating codes by retailers and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic candidate
for vice president, changed his campaign schedule to fly to Chicago
so he and Democratic nominee Al Gore could appear Monday on
television interviews, campaign officials said, to discuss the FTC
report.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been a leading critic in Congress of the
entertainment industry on the issue. Campaign officials said he
would have no comment Sunday on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for Republican nominee George W.
Bush, said the Texas governor ''believes the entertainment industry
has to take personal responsibility for the products it provides to
our children. And parents also have a role to play. We're all in
this together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee is to hold a hearing Wednesday on
the findings, with Lieberman scheduled to attend. He and Commerce
Committee Chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., backed an amendment
by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., that passed the Senate last year
requesting the study.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Clinton ordered the report himself and paid
for it with White House money. His announcement came after a spate
of deadly shootings in the nation's schools, and the president said
the barrage of violence fed to young people through entertainment
blurs the line between ''fantasy and reality violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders questioned what conclusions the government
could draw from scrutinizing Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are causing moral decay in this country, we ought to
have an explosion of crime,'' Jack Valenti, head of the Motion
Picture Association of America, said Sunday. ''The exact opposite
is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that any evaluation of the marketing practices of
moviemakers can only be subjective and praised Hollywood's
three-decades-old voluntary code in informing parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost 32 years, this industry has been the only segment
of our national marketplace that voluntarily turns away revenues at
the box office to redeem the pledge that we have made to parents,''
Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   Video game makers stress that more than 70 percent of their
users are over 18. According to the Interactive Digital Software
Association, the industry trade group, adults buy nine of every 10
video and computer games sold in the United States. Only 7 percent
of video games sold and rated since 1995 fall into the mature
category.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some retailers have pledged to ramp up enforcement of the
code. On Thursday, Kmart announced that it would stop selling
mature-rated games to anyone under 17, using a barcode scanner that
will prompt cashiers to ask for identification from youths.
Wal-Mart said it would adopt a similar policy. Some stores,
including Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Co., have stopped
selling the M-rated games altogether.

<HEADLINE> Sir Julian Critchley Dies at 69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Outspoken former lawmaker Sir Julian Critchley,
who clashed with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over
European unity and eventually left the Conservative Party because
he felt it was too anti-European, has died. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley died in a hospital Saturday morning, his son Joshua
Critchley said. He had been suffering from bone and prostate cancer
and more recently been diagnosed with a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley, who had represented the Aldershot constituency in
southern England for the Conservative Party since 1964, quit
Parliament at the last national elections in 1997, which saw Tony
Blair's Labor Party sweep the Tories from power after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the Sorbonne in Paris and Oxford University,
Critchley first entered Parliament in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He openly expressed his disappointment at never achieving
ministerial rank. As a strong supporter of European integration, he
was often at odds with Thatcher's euro-skeptic stance and described
her once as a ''great she-elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he supported former defense secretary Michael
Heseltine's bid to oust Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative
Party. Heseltine failed -- further weakening Critchley's political
clout -- but the contest took its toll on Thatcher, who was
ultimately ousted as prime minister and later party leader the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 elections for the European Parliament, Critchley's rift
with party bosses widened when he supported several unofficial,
pro-European unity Tory candidates. He left the party soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted in 1995 by Thatcher's successor, John Major.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sir Julian was a colorful Conservative MP over many years,
whose wit brought sparkle to the House of Commons,'' said
Conservative Party chairman Michael Ancram. ''He will be sorely
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrat party, said,
''Julian was one of those rare creatures who actually made people
feel better about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a great friend and mentor to me. He had that acute
understanding of the fact that politics is a serious business, but
the politicians to worry about are the ones that take themselves
too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Critchley is survived by his wife, Heather, their son, a
daughter and by two daughters from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral details were not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Little -- and big -- pieces of nostalgia sold at auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) - A lawn ornament depicting the dish that
ran away with the spoon fetched $150 while a double-deck carousel
brought $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 430 pieces of nostalgia from a now-closed amusement park
sold for more than $1 million at auction Saturday. Charles R. Wood
founded ''Gaslight Village'' in 1960 as a family fun park in this
tourism-driven village 53 miles north of Albany. He closed it this
year as part of a plan to build a civic center.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders came from around the block and around the world,
including a New Zealander who bought a movie prop boat called
''Black Swan,'' for $17,500.
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Jan Tornabene of Pownal, Vt., bought a two-deck carousel
made in Spain for $125,000. They plan to set up and run the
carousel. Individual carousel horses went for as much as $17,500.
</P>
<P>
   George Green wanted to buy the antique car he and his wife Janie
sat in 24 years ago when he proposed to her, but the price went too
high. The Greens ended up with a baby grand piano for $200 and five
pinball machines - one for each of their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody came with checkbook in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm only here for sentimental reasons,'' said Linda Mangione,
who has been coming to Lake George for 35 years. ''It's so sad that
the park is closing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Aaron Sele struck out a season-high 10 batters
and Alex Rodriguez hit a disputed home run to help the Seattle
Mariners beat the Minnesota Twins 8-1 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (14-10) improved to 13-3 in his career against the Twins,
the most wins he has against any team. Sele allowed one run and six
hits in seven innings to snap a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who have won two straight after losing 18 of 25,
remained two games in front of Oakland in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Jay Buhner each hit three-run homers off J.C.
Romero (2-6) in the third inning to lead Seattle's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson walked and Mike Cameron singled with two outs
in the third. After a wild pitch, Rodriguez drove a ball over the
right-field fence for his 36th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit .444 (20-for-45) with five homers and 19 RBIs in
12 games against Minnesota this season.
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Tom Kelly came on the field to argue that there
was fan interference when right fielder Brian Buchanan jumped for
the ball, but first-base umpire Dan Morrison ruled in favor of the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   After walks to Edgar Martinez and John Olerud, Buhner made it
6-0 with his 24th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson added a two-run single in the sixth for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Twins rookie A.J. Pierzynski went 3-for-3 and improved to
13-for-26 (.500) in his last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: For the first time since Safeco Field opened on July 15,
1999, the retractable roof was closed for three consecutive games
because of rain or the threat of rain. The roof was shut Sunday for
the 12th time in 71 Mariner home games this season. ... The Twins
acquired OF Lew Ford from Boston in a trade for RHP Hector
Carrasco. ... Carrasco had not allowed an earned run in 15 of his
last 20 appearances (24 1/3 innings), but he surrendered three runs
on two hits and two walks in just 1 1/3 innings in Saturday's loss.
... When Buhner walked in the second inning, Seattle set a club
record with 671 walks eclipsing the mark set in 1996. ... Seattle
have scored six or more runs in an inning nine times this season.

<HEADLINE> Lions 15, Redskins 10  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- So much for the Washington Redskins'
spending spree on future Hall of Famers, notably Deion Sanders and
Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Lions beat the heralded Redskins 15-10 Sunday as
Jason Hanson kicked five field goals, including a 54-yarder that
might have been good at 60 yards. The defense sealed the win with
four interceptions of Brad Johnson, three in the final quarter and
one with 48 seconds left by Terry Fair.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders and Smith were another reason for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the yardage that Detroit gained -- almost all of it
between the 20s, was on throws toward Sanders, staying away from
second-year-man Champ Bailey on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   And both Smith and Sanders had key penalties on Detroit's drive
for its final field goal -- Sanders a 15-yard facemask call after a
Charlie Batch completion to Johnnie Morton and Smith a dubious
roughing-the-passer call that kept the drive alive after an
incomplete pass on third and 17. Smith appeared to be in the air as
Batch released the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders even made a mistake on a punt with two minutes left,
failing to catch a ball that rolled another 10 yards and forced the
Redskins to start their final drive from their own 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit defense, meanwhile, limited Washington's offense to
one touchdown. Johnson was 23-of-35 for 245 yards with those four
interceptions, one on a ball thrown so high and off target that
Lions safety Kurt Schulz probably could have called a fair catch on
the play.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, playing his first game after missing all of the preseason
with a broken knee bone, was 16-of-31 for 194 yards and was
intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the second straight in the regular season by the
Lions (2-0) over the Redskins (1-1) after 16 losses dating back to
1965. Washington beat Detroit 27-13 in the playoffs last January.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Detroit got to the end zone was a play that looked
for a while like it might tilt the game in Washington's favor.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of the second quarter, with the Lions leading
3-0, Johnson dropped back to pass and threw in the direction of
Larry Centers.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was deflected and 319-pound defensive tackle Kelvin
Pritchett grabbed it, juggled it, then rumbled down the left
sideline. He dodged several tacklers and appeared to be all but in
the end zone when 326-pound guard Tre Johnson dove at his ankles
and pulled him down just inside the 1.
</P>
<P>
   After two runs by James Stewart, the Lions were 2 yards away.
Then Batch's third-down pass went awry, and Detroit had to settle
for Hanson's 20-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, Washington went 75 yards on 13 plays, eating
up 8 minutes and 33 seconds, and went ahead on Johnson's 5-yard
third-down pass to Stephen Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson put the Lions ahead 9-7 on the first drive of the third
quarter with a 54-yard line drive that cleared the crossbar by 5
yards. Brett Conway countered with a 26-yarder late in the period
after Bryant Westbrook stopped Adrian Murrell inches short of a
first down at the 9-yard line and Washington elected to kick rather
than go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Howard's 44-yard kickoff return set up the next score,
Hanson's 37-yard kick that made it 12-10 3:24 into the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the final drive and the big mistakes by Smith and
Sanders.

<HEADLINE> Knight Was Done a Long Time Ago  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was done long before this.
</P>
<P>
   That Bob Knight's career at Indiana ended with a whimper instead
of one last loud bang should come as no surprise. It might even be
better this way.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's victims have suffered long enough; for that matter, so
has he. An entire university and much of the state need to move on.
So does he.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people wanted a Woody Hayes ending, something
pyrotechnic, a wild-eyed Knight grabbing an opposing player who was
running up the sideline with the ball in the middle of a game. That
way, the anti-Bob crowd would have been smug and the red sweaters
would have felt at least Bob got his money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the closing act was as simple as Knight grabbing a
student's arm to lecture him about manners. The best thing to be
said is that it spared everybody a lot of pain.
</P>
<P>
   There were already conflicting reports about the marks on the
kid's arms, whether they existed or not, whether curses were thrown
or not. Then there was the interesting coincidence of the kid's
stepfather being a publicity-hungry former radio-talk show host who
once compared Knight with ''a dark cloud that hangs over this good
university.'' And of course, there was the usual assistant swearing
on his life that Knight was just picking lint off the kid's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's all beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   University president Myles Brand called Knight's firing
''unquestionably, the most difficult decision I ever had to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Knight made it easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Brand made the hard decision on May 15, when he put his coach on
the clock. A few days earlier, the president was forced to deal
with a videotape that everyone in the country -- except for Roy
Firestone -- had already watched a half-dozen times. It showed
Knight grabbing former IU guard Neil Reed by the throat at a 1997
practice.
</P>
<P>
   That brief clip became the prism through which 29 seasons of the
best and worst a coach can accomplish was viewed. The more
headlines it generated, the more repressed memories were loosed and
the more denials became necessary. But Knight had been fraying
nerves long before that, including every one of the Hoosier teams
that failed to get past the second round of the NCAA tournament the
past half-dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that's beside the point, too.
</P>
<P>
   Brand finally admitted at his news conference Sunday in
Indianapolis that the university had been slow to react. Back in
May, the anti-Bobs branded him only the latest in a long line of
chickens. What they should have called Brand was smart.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was never in doubt after that. Brand knew he could
wait his coach out. Knight wasted no time proving him right.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17 weeks since the school put him on notice, Knight has
bad-mouthed the administration and alumni, thrown a tirade at a
female athletic department official in his office and refused to
show up at a handful of important IU functions.
</P>
<P>
   Most telling, perhaps, he defied Brand to do something about it.
They had one very short phone conversation Friday night, hours
after Knight called his own news conference and -- basketball coach
to the end -- diagrammed the confrontation with the student. Brand
asked Knight to stay in town for a few days. Knight said he was
going fishing.
</P>
<P>
   He did, and somewhere in Canada on Sunday morning, Brand called
him again and asked Knight to resign. Defiant to the end, his coach
probably said that was how cowards went out.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding emotion is relief, but there should be sadness,
too.
</P>
<P>
   A bully is gone from the coaching profession, but so is a good
man.
</P>
<P>
   Knight won national and Big Ten championships, he graduated most
of his players and taught nearly all of them lessons that will
extend to the end of their lives. He also terrorized secretaries,
referees, opposing coaches, his assistant coaches and even his own
kid. Sometimes, they were the same lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's most persistent critic, former IU professor Murray
Sperber, took a leave of absence and his family to Canada this
summer rather than return to teaching in the fall and face the
abuse the pro-Bobs promised would await him.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old freshman who inadvertently or not put himself in
the middle of this latest episode already has a computer file
bulging with threatening e-mail. Knight has time and his hands, a
paycheck for two more years, and one last chance to shore up a
sagging legend.
</P>
<P>
   That won't begin soon, if at all. Knight is one old dog who
stubbornly refused to learn new tricks. The shame is that nobody
saw fit to stand up to him long ago, back when he was still
bullying people big enough to fight back. Back when the discipline
he demanded from everybody else was still in him.

<HEADLINE> N. Korean Official To Visit Seoul  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In another sign of improving relations
on the divided Korean peninsula, a top envoy from the North will
visit South Korea this week to discuss tension-easing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun will fly to Seoul on Monday for a four-day visit as
a special envoy of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the office of
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He will pay a courtesy call on the South Korean president, meet
other officials and visit Cheju, a resort island off the southern
tip of the Korean peninsula, it said.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Kim Yong Sun is expected to discuss the date
of the North Korean leader's return visit to Seoul following the
inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang in June.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials attach great significance to the visit by
Kim Yong Sun, a close confidant of the North's leader, seeing it as
a step forward in inter-Korea relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun heads the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which
handles southern investment in the North and promotes exchanges
with nations that have no diplomatic ties with the North.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the secretary of the North's ruling communist
Worker's Party and was the only official from the North who sat in
on the June summit.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Yong Sun's visit comes as Pyongyang is seeking 1 million
tons of emergency food aid from South Korea. Seoul officials said
they were seriously considering the North's request.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas fought the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an
armistice, not a peace treaty. Their relations have thawed
dramatically since the June summit, the first ever between them.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic symbolic gesture, athletes from the two Koreas
will march under a reunification banner at the opening ceremonies
of the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Olympic officials
announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the summit accord, the Koreas have stopped propaganda
broadcasts against each other and allowed 100 people each to cross
the border in mid-August for temporary family reunions. Two more
family reunions are expected by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, South Korea repatriated 63 former North Korean
guerrillas and spies who had served decades in southern prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas also agreed to relink a major cross-border rail line
that was cut off shortly before the Korean War broke out in 1950.
When reconnected, the rail line will connect the two Korean
capitals and continue to Shinuiju, a major city on the North's
border with China.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Tankers Free To Fill Up  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Blockades at France's oil refineries and depots
were lifted Sunday and tankers began refilling service stations
after six days of protests against high taxes paralyzed fuel
distribution and stalled planes, trains and motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said that truckers and farmers in western
France had removed their seven holdout blockades by early Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fuel tankers can begin making deliveries,'' said Pierre
Navaro, a ministry spokesman. ''We can begin restocking
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry gave heavy vehicles permission to drive
in France on Sunday to expedite fuel deliveries. Trucks are
normally barred from French roads on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of blockades and the onset of fuel distribution,
however, was not expected to immediately ease the plight of
motorists, who were still lined up bumper-to-bumper at service
stations around France. LCI television reported that in the
southern city of Marseille, 60 percent of service stations remained
dry Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as OPEC members meeting in Vienna, Austria, agreed
Sunday to boost the group's official oil output by 800,000 barrels
a day. The decision came amid mounting international pressure on
OPEC to pump more oil to stem surging fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   But as protests wound down in France, unrest in neighboring
European countries appeared to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, thousands of truckers, taxi drivers and tour bus
operators took to the streets to push the government to reconsider
a lowering of fuel taxes or a tax exemption for the transportation
industry.
</P>
<P>
   British truckers blocked several refineries and gas stations,
causing nationwide shortages. About 100 Shell stations ran out of
fuel because of the protest at a huge Shell refinery in northeast
England.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not critical by any means but it is getting worse. If
these actions continue into the early part of next week there will
be severe difficulties,'' said Roy Holloway, director of the Petrol
Retailers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the north German city of Hildesheim, a national truckers'
group warned the government that the industry's mood is
''aggressive'' and that high fuel costs could spark large-scale
protests, Focus magazine reported in editions to go on newsstands
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In France, truckers and farmers began lifting blockades on
Saturday after union leaders unanimously called for an end to the
protest, which began last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Road Transport, the country's largest
truckers union, accepted the government's offer on Friday, as did a
smaller union. The last holdout, France's second-largest truckers'
group UNOSTRA, accepted the deal Saturday and joined two
agriculture unions in calls to lift blockades from more than 160
oil refineries and fuel depots around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that joined the protests -- including ambulance
drivers and taxi drivers -- won a variety of concessions from
France's leftist government.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Laurent Fabius said Sunday that the total
impact of tax concessions made to truckers would cost the
government about $405 million over 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers were offered a 20-cent reimbursement per gallon of fuel
this year, and a 14-cent refund per gallon on gasoline taxes next
year. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, under pressure from Green Party
members of his coalition, vowed that no further concessions would
be made.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers were offered a 30 percent decrease in gasoline taxes for
the year 2000, said Luc Guyau, president of the National Federation
of Agricultural Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi drivers were given the go-ahead to raise their fares by 4.5
percent starting next month to cover the rising cost of fuel,
FranceInfo radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blockades caused disruptions at some airports and on
high-speed trains. Many local governments began rationing gasoline
to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Nice-Cote d'Azur airport said that flights had returned to
normal on Sunday after cancellations and delays during the week due
to lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel fuel in France costs $2.84 per gallon, nearly twice the
price of such fuel in the United States. Fuel prices here have
jumped about 40 percent in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Low oxygen levels found in Atlantic County waters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Atlantic County's back bays have
posted low oxygen levels every summer since 1992, according to data
from the state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Zimmer, an environmental scientist with the department's
Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring, said the data also shows low
oxygen may not be just a summer problem, but a year-round issue in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Continued low oxygen levels can threaten animal life in the
water, said Richard H. Colby, a biology professor from Richard
Stockton College of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the potential to have a tremendous impact on the
fishing industry,'' he told The Press of Atlantic City for Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental department considers oxygen levels low when
they drop below 4 milligrams per liter. Anything below that may
harm marine life and cause fish kills.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid mainland development may be one cause, said Colby, also a
member of an environmental advisory board to the Atlantic County
freeholders. Development may increase the amount of fertilizer and
other nutrients that feed into nearby waters, causing algae blooms.
</P>
<P>
   And algae blooms may cause hypoxia, which is when single-cell
plants die and sink to the ocean floor, consuming oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer told the advisory board that other possible causes
include wildlife waste from animals such as geese, stormwater
drainage from nearby towns and raw sewage discharges from failing
sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would expect that in the next couple years, we'll be looking
at some detailed monitoring in the rivers and back bays,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Rosenblatt, the DEP's Atlantic coast coordinator for
watershed planning, said the county's hypoxia problem should be
studied when watershed plans are developed for the Mullica and
Great Egg Harbor river systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plans are scheduled to take four years to finish,
Rosenblatt said corrective measures can be taken before that.

<HEADLINE> Lazio defends his handshake with Arafat  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio defended his handshake with
Yasser Arafat, insisting Sunday that there was a ''big difference''
between his greeting of the Palestinian leader and the greetings he
has criticized the Clintons for giving Fidel Castro and Arafat's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The White House over the weekend released a photograph of Arafat
clasping the grinning Republican's hand. The photograph, which
first appeared in Sunday's New York Post, was taken by a White
House photographer in 1998 during a trip Lazio took to the Mideast
with the Clintons and other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph was released a day after Lazio, Hillary Rodham
Clinton's opponent for U.S. Senate, criticized the president for
shaking hands with Cuban President Fidel Castro at the United
Nations Millennium Summit last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not have shook Fidel Castro's hand,'' Lazio said
Friday. ''I don't know what there is to shake his hand about, to
tell you the truth. I think we send the wrong message when we
embrace, whether it's Mrs. Arafat or Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has previously attacked the first lady for hugging
Arafat's wife during a visit to the Middle East last fall. Clinton
has said that the hug was a formality akin to a handshake and that
she would have caused an international incident had she rebuffed
her that day.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Sunday about the propriety of the White House
releasing the Lazio-Arafat photo when she is involved in a
hard-fought Senate campaign in which Jewish voters are a crucial
prize, Clinton said: ''You'll have to ask the White House about
that. I think from the White House perspective, he attacked the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It sure sounds like taxpayer money was once again used to
further the Clinton campaign,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, commenting on the condition of
anonymity, defended the action.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was released at the request of the media,'' the official
said. ''We see no problem with Mr. Lazio being photographed shaking
hands with Chairman Arafat. But there does seem to be a touch of
irony in his criticism of both the president and the president's
handshake with Mr. Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent part of Sunday campaigning near Albany. He denied it
was hypocritical of him to criticize the president for shaking
hands with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big difference, big difference,'' he said. ''I would not shake
Fidel Castro's hand. I think he's been a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it was different from his greeting Arafat, Lazio said:
''The difference is, this is a person who we're involved in peace
negotiations with.''

<HEADLINE> Redman Wins LPGA Betsy King Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUTZTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Michele Redman shot a 4-under-par 68 Sunday
to win the First Union Betsy King Classic by three strokes, the
second victory of her LPGA career and one that moved her into the
top 10 on the tour's money list.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a relief,'' said Redman, whose other victory in eight
seasons on tour was the 1997 Big Apple Classic. ''I just have been
playing for myself lately and not trying to worry about anything
else. It came down to wanting my golf to speak for myself, and I
think it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman, who had six birdies Sunday, finished three rounds at the
Berkleigh Country Club course in 14-under 202. The $120,000 first
prize gave her a season total of $502,071, 10th on the LPGA list.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, who started the final round with a one-stroke lead over
Tina Barrett, hit a 9-iron within 9 feet on No. 12 for a birdie
that put her at 14 under. She bogeyed No. 15 but got back to 14
under with a 3-foot birdie putt on the closing hole.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, who moved into eighth place in the Solheim Cup
standings, had been suffering from fatigue and nearly didn't play
in the tournament. She failed to make the cut at the State Farm
Rail Classic earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really tried to think about what I had to do,'' Redman said.
''My self-esteem lately has been as good as it was when I won the
first time, and I have been a lot healthier mentally lately. My
putting was as good as it has ever been, and I hit a lot of good
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Bartholomew, who closed with a 70, and Meg Mallon, who had
a 65 Sunday, finished tied for second at 205.
</P>
<P>
   Bartholomew missed chances for birdies on 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Redman bogeyed, it kept me aggressive,'' said
Bartholomew, who had the best finish of her eight-year career. ''I
really felt that I could win. But I'm happy that I kept myself
pretty calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Kane had three birdies down the stretch in a 68 that left
her at 206.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who shot a course-record 63 in Friday's opening round,
matched par for the second straight day and was another stroke
back, tied with Hi Hyung Kim, the 1999 Rookie of the Year, who had
a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament host Betsy King shot a 72 and finished with a 1-under
215.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Women's Team Holed Up  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic women's basketball
team was two hours late for practice Monday (Sunday EDT) as
thousands of protesters vowing to disrupt an economic summit in the
team's hotel blocked traffic nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffles broke out around at least one entrance to the Crown
Casino as police tried to clear an access path, Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio reported. For the most part, however, the
protest was peaceful and most entrances to the venue remained open.
Police have turned the casino into a virtual fortress, erecting a
steel fence around it.
</P>
<P>
   The women's basketball team, in Melbourne for exhibition games
prior to Friday's opening of the Olympics in Sydney, was due to
start practice at 9 a.m. but was stranded in the casino hotel lobby
because its bus could not get through the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize that there are bigger things going on in the world
than our practice so we've pretty much learned to just be
flexible,'' said Carol Callan, a team spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Callan said the team ''had an idea that this was going to
happen. So I think we were prepared mentally for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players, though, were more perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   DeLisha Milton, a player with the Los Angeles Sparks, said she
was ''a little annoyed. We are used to being on a tight schedule
and getting things done. Any time we have to deviate, our bodies
kind of go into shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The team finally left the hotel two hours behind schedule.
Police initially discussed taking them down the Yarra River in a
boat, but eventually the team walked out of the hotel through
protesters, who let them through peacefully, and got onto a waiting
bus.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before the Asia-Pacific Economic Summit was due
to begin, protesters gathered at sites around the casino, watched
by police in boats patrolling the nearby Yarra river and a
helicopter that buzzed overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of senior business executives and government leaders
including Microsoft's Bill Gates are due to attend the summit to
discuss future economic developments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event is organized by the Swiss-based World
Economic Forum, a group that brings together business and
government heads to discuss the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Bartram, who runs a Melbourne computer consultancy, said
she planned to join Monday's protest, which organizers said aimed
to shut down the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose my major concern about the corporations is that they
don't seem to take into consideration what they are actually doing
to the planet globally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of corporate greed, she cited claims that
sportswear maker Nike runs sweatshops in Indonesia -- an accusation
denied last week by Nike executives.
</P>
<P>
   But fearing it would be targeted by violent protests similar to
those that marred last year's World Trade Organization talks in
Seattle, Nike closed its flagship Melbourne store on Sunday and
boarded up the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Bartram said she would not resort to violence on Monday and
police say they believe the majority of up to 15,000 protesters
will be peaceful. But authorities have prepared for the worst,
drafting in extra officers from rural areas and freeing up police
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Claude Smadja said the summit was the wrong target for
opponents of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''This protest is completely misplaced,'' Smadja told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''The aim is not to promote globalization. The aim is to discuss
the issues raised by globalization''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of groups, from pupils at an exclusive girls' college to
homosexuals claiming they are exploited by corporate greed to Green
lawmakers, plan to march Monday under the ''S11'' banner -- the name
taken from the date, Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Brown of the Australian Green Party met other Green
lawmakers Sunday to discuss the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Greens were opposed to the growth of a new
aristocracy among the multinational corporate bodies who were
becoming a de facto, undemocratic world government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're also concerned about the impoverished people of the
world not having a voice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns were echoed by protesters at Treasury Gardens, many
of whom wore pins with the words, ''Smash corporate tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I really just want to send a message to the corporations of
the world that they really have no right to be the world
government,'' said protester Chris Fletcher.

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, who was fired and
jailed nine months on charges of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets, has
reached a plea bargain in which he will plead guilty to one charge and cooperate
with federal investigators, Justice Department sources said. Lee will plead
guilty to one felony count of unlawfully retaining nuclear weapon secrets, be
sentenced to time already served and be freed following a hearing, officials
said. The officials said Lee has agreed to provide information on seven missing

Barak: Jerusalem Concessions Possible

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested today he would
consider less than full Israeli sovereignty over the key holy site in
Jerusalem's Old City revered by Muslims and Jews, in a bid to keep alive hopes
for a peace treaty with the Palestinians. In speeches and interviews, Barak also
outlined a solution for sharing the disputed city that appeared to go beyond
what Israel has offered in the past. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ''has to
move,'' Barak told ABC This Week. ''In a way, it's now or never.'' Barak has
said only four or five weeks remained to forge a treaty.

1,400 civilian lives so far this year. The march, which filled an avenue of the
capital and wound through the center of the city, came as peace talks between
the two sides have stalled, and as the United States is pumping $1.3 billion in
mostly military aid to Colombia.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe's office dismissed a $400
million lawsuit filed in the United States accusing the Zimbabwean leader of
violence and human rights abuses, calling the suit a ''non-event.'' Mugabe was
handed the suit Thursday as he entered a church in Harlem just before delivering
a speech there, margins of the U.N. Millennium Summit held in New York. The
lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, says Mugabe orchestrated violence
and was responsible for human rights abuses -- including the beating and fatal
burning of an opponent -- ahead of June parliamentary elections.

four interceptions of Brad Johnson, three in the final quarter and one with 48

career Grand Slam champion Pete Sampras, 20-year-old Marat Safin won the U.S.
Open 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 today and stamped himself as the player of the future in
men's tennis. Safin celebrated by getting down on his knees and kissing the
court in Arthur Ashe Stadium. The youngest champion since Sampras won the first
of his four U.S. Open titles a decade ago, Safin won his first major title in
the most lopsided victory over a former champion in 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Broncos 42, Falcons 14  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Anderson from the University of Utah who was
shredding the opposition Sunday wasn't Atlanta's Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Denver rookie Mike Anderson, making his first NFL start because
of injuries to Terrell Davis and Olandis Gary, carried 31 times for
131 yards and two touchdowns, and the Broncos routed the Falcons
42-14.
</P>
<P>
   The win might have been a costly one for the Broncos, however.
Already ravaged by injuries that had three starters on the sideline
for this game, the Broncos lost placekicker Jason Elam late in the
second quarter when he was wiped out by a block on a kickoff return
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A team spokesman said Elam injured his lower back. His right leg
dangling, Elam was assisted off the field by two trainers and was
taken to the locker room on a cart.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griese, who entered the game as the league's top-rated
passer, completed 20 of 33 passes for 268 yards and three
touchdowns, two of them to Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Denver (1-1), rebounding from Monday night's 41-36 loss to
defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis, had 407 total yards
compared to 186 for the Falcons (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled the return of Atlanta coach Dan Reeves to
Denver, where he coached the Broncos for 12 seasons (1981-92).
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos scored on their first five possessions en route to a
34-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had 291 total yards in the half compared to Atlanta's 44.
The Falcons had no first downs and only 19 yards on three
possessions in the first quarter, and they trailed 27-0 before
picking up their initial first down with 8:10 remaining in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Anderson, a 26-year-old rookie drafted in the sixth round,
earned the start when Davis was declared inactive because of a
sprained left ankle. Gary was put on injured reserve with a torn
ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson carried the final four times on a 48-yard drive, capped
by his 2-yard scoring run, for a 7-0 lead with 8:25 left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dwight fumbled the ensuing kickoff at the Atlanta 16, and
Elam kicked a 29-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   After an Atlanta punt, Elam kicked a 51-yard field goal with
1:42 left in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Griese's 21-yard pass to Robert Brooks helped set up a 6-yard
scoring pass to fullback Howard Griffith early in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson capped a 61-yard drive with a 20-yard run for a 27-0
lead with 8:27 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos made it 34-0 when Griese passed 25 yards to Brooks
and 18 to Anderson, then connected with Rod Smith, who made a
leaping 11-yard TD reception over cornerback Ashley Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Darrick Vaughn returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards
for a touchdown on the play that injured Elam. He was blocked by
Johndale Carty and was sent tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Griese threw a 37-yard TD pass to Smith early in the third
quarter, and the Atlanta offense got its only score with 3:04 left
in the period when Chris Chandler passed 35 yards to Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was 9-for-22 for 128 yards. Jamal Anderson carried
seven times for 38 yards.

<HEADLINE> Rams 37, Seahawks 34  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams are still winning and they're
making it even more exciting this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams used a 41-yard pass from Kurt Warner to Torry Holt to
set up a 27-yard field goal by Jeff Wilkins with 23 seconds left
for a 37-34 victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Super Bowl champs came back to beat Denver 41-36
on a touchdown in the final 2:58 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis drove 61 yards in eight plays for its winning score.
Warner's sideline completion to Holt came on third-and-17 from the
50 after a sack for a 7-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks lost in their home opener after getting shut out
last week in Miami, but they put a scare into the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Warner completed 35 of 47 passes for 386 yards and a touchdown,
with one interception. Marshall Faulk, St. Louis' other major
offensive weapon, ran 15 times for 68 yards and made nine catches
for 85 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna, nearly benched by coach Mike Holmgren this week, was
20-for-31 for 245 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle tied it at 34 on a 34-yard pass to rookie Darrell
Jackson with 2:05 left. The drive was kept alive when officials
ruled Kitna wasn't intercepted by Grant Wistrom at the Seattle 24
after examining replay.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams went ahead 34-27 when safety Devin Bush ran in a fumble
with 5:12 left. Todd Collins sacked Kitna, causing the fumble, and
Kevin Carter caught the ball in the air, running 2 yards before
fumbling to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Watters' 1-yard touchdown plunge with 7:40 to go tied the
score at 27 after Warner passed 4 yards to Roland Williams for a
TD, his 14th consecutive completion. That had put the Rams ahead
27-20.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the lead changed hands twice before
Seahawks rookie Kris Heppner tied it at 20 with a 43-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle scored its first offensive touchdown of the season on
Watters' 3-yard run on the opening drive of the second half. St.
Louis came right back with a nine-play, 69-yard march as Warner
picked apart the defense on 7-for-7 passing for 64 yards. Faulk
scored on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams strung together a 12-play, 68-yard drive, with Warner
going 7-for-10 for 56 yards, to take a 13-10 lead at halftime on
fullback Robert Holcombe's 1-yard run. Warner gained 11 yards on a
quarterback draw on third-and-1 from the Seattle 36.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins kicked a pair of 48-yard field goals in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bellamy stepped in front of rookie Trung Canidate,
intercepted a pass by Warner and returned it 84 yards for Seattle's
first touchdown of the season and a 10-3 lead in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner kicked his first NFL field goal, a 19-yarder on
Seattle's first possession of the game.

<HEADLINE> Saints 28, Chargers 27  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints played quite the
spoilers against the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blake's third touchdown pass of the game, an 8-yarder to
Joe Horn with 47 seconds left, lifted the Saints to a 28-27 victory
over San Diego on Sunday in the Chargers' home opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints (1-1) moved 90 yards on 10 plays for the winning
score, aided by a pass interference call against cornerback DeRon
Jenkins and an unnecessary roughness call against safety Rodney
Harrison for a hit on Andrew Glover. Horn was wide open on the TD
play. The Chargers (0-2) had 12 players on the field, a penalty
that naturally was declined. The conversion pass was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams had a mixed performance in his first game in his
hometown since high school. He was held to 50 yards on 24 carries,
but scored on a 13-yard pass from Blake to pull the Saints to 24-19
late in the third quarter. Williams knocked over cornerback Darryll
Lewis at the goal line and spiked the ball after scoring. Blake's
conversion pass was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Blake completed 33 of 46 passes for 259 yards, with two
interceptions. He also threw a 6-yard TD pass to Horn in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 24-13 halftime lead, the Chargers committed
numerous blunders in the second half. Ryan Leaf was intercepted
twice in the second half, the first by Fred Weary to lead to
Williams' touchdown and the second by Alex Molden to seal the
Saints' victory with five seconds left. Leaf was sacked twice on
San Diego's final drive and five times overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers also botched a halfback pass on fourth-and-1 from
the Saints' 15 midway through the fourth quarter. Robert Chancey
threw a terrible pass to tight end Freddie Jones, who was covered,
and the Saints took over.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf did throw his first touchdown pass since Oct. 25, 1998, a
20-yarder to Curtis Conway in the Chargers' 21-point third quarter.
Rookie Ronney Jenkins turned a muff into an electrifying 93-yard
kickoff return for another touchdown, also in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf was 12-of-24 for 134 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints started their comeback with Williams' TD catch,
followed by Doug Brien's third field goal of the game, a 31-yarder
that made it 24-22 with 14:52 to play. John Carney then hit from 49
yards with 5:08 to go, his second of the game, to give the Chargers
a five-point lead. Carney also kicked a 42-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf hasn't played much since his last TD pass, which came two
starts before he was benched midway through his turbulent rookie
season of 1998. He made one more appearance late that season,
committing three turnovers in a mopup role, then missed all of 1999
with a shoulder injury. He won back the job in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf still has quite a ways to go to close his
TD-to-interception ratio, which stands at three scoring passes and
20 pickoffs. He had three interceptions and one lost fumble in the
opening 9-6 loss at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf also got drilled by linebacker Keith Mitchell while
blocking on a reverse and had to leave for one play. On his first
play back, he threw a 19-yard pass to Freddie Jones to set up
Robert Chancey's 3-yard scoring run that gave the Chargers the lead
for good at 10-7 early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who scored touchdowns of 86 and 89 yards on kickoff
returns in the exhibition season, showed his speed was for real in
giving the Chargers a 24-10 lead with 1:36 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After Brien kicked a 20-yard field, Jenkins muffed the kickoff,
picked up the ball and took off. Two Saints missed tackles at the
15, and Jenkins weaved through traffic until he broke free at the
50.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Records 3,000th Strike Out  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Randy Johnson needed just four innings Sunday to
become the 12th player to reach the 3,000-strikeout plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out a season-high 14 in seven innings against the
Florida Marlins. He left with the score tied at 3 and got his
fourth no-decision in his last nine starts. He gave up six hits and
one earned run. He walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, celebrating his 37th birthday, struck out the side in
the second, fourth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell became Johnson's 3,000th victim, striking out on
four pitches to end the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett carried the ball into the dugout, while
Johnson walked off the field to a standing ovation. He raised his
black glove into the air, acknowledging the crowd's applause, as he
reached the dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first strikeout of the game, Marlins leadoff hitter
Luis Castillo, also gave him 300 for the third consecutive season
and the fourth time overall.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan is the only other pitcher to strike out 300 in three
straight seasons, doing it in 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's four 300-strikeout seasons are second only to Ryan's
six.

<HEADLINE> Polish Ship Wreck Kills 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A Polish sailing yacht carrying young
passengers rammed into an unidentified vessel Sunday morning,
killing at least two people and leaving five others missing.
</P>
<P>
   Danish navy helicopters found one survivor and the bodies of the
two dead from the deck of the 45-foot Bieszczady yacht, a rescue
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The yacht, which belonged to a maritime school based in Poland's
Baltic port of Gdynia, sank immediately after impact, 22 miles off
Denmark's western coast.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, Malgorzata Kedzielska, 19, told Danish police that
she and the skipper had misunderstood the red and green navigation
lights on the vessel into which they rammed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Luby's Cafeteria Closes Its Doors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- The restaurant where 23 customers were
killed nine years ago by a deranged gunman has closed, falling
victim to competition from other restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the horrifying memories of the slayings, residents had
continued to dine at Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen. But the cafeteria
-- one of 15 Luby's scheduled to close -- turned off the lights for
the last time Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Customers lined up almost out the door at lunch Friday to have
their favorite menu items one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Hilliard, who works next door, said she went to Luby's
for lunch nearly every day. ''It's just so sad,'' Hilliard said of
the closing.
</P>
<P>
   The mass killing occurred shortly after George Hennard drove his
truck through the window of the cafeteria's dining area during the
lunch hour Oct. 16, 1991. Moving through a group of more than 100
people, he killed 23 and wounded 20 others before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's 34 employees have been offered jobs at other
Luby's restaurants. Luby's operates more than 200 restaurants in 10
states, with about three-quarters of them in Texas.

<HEADLINE> Striking Hamilton Township teachers rally; contract talks resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two days after a state judge threatened
striking Hamilton Township teachers with huge fines if they don't
return to work, thousands of teachers and supporters rallied at the
Mercer County Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m., shortly after the hourlong afternoon rally, union
negotiators resumed court-ordered talks with district
representatives at a Princeton hotel, but it was unclear whether
the Hamilton teachers would return to their classrooms Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt that this will be a very long night,'' Karen
Joseph, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, said
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   She said the union negotiating team had given a modified
proposal to the state mediator overseeing the talks, but did not
know whether the Hamilton Township Board of Education had modified
its last proposal. Joseph expected the mediator to return to the
room where the union negotiators are huddled about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the board of education have been at an impasse
over issues including salary increases and health insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 members of the Hamilton Township Education Association
were set to meet at a local firehouse at 5:30 a.m. Monday to
discuss negotiation progress and then decide whether to head to
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a tentative agreement, it will be presented to the
membership '' with a recommendation to accept it, Joseph said.
''I'm sure that would ensure their return to work.''
</P>
<P>
   School board officials were not in their offices Sunday and have
not been returning calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers are under financial pressure to get the school year
started.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Parrillo, angered that the
teachers ignored the back-to-work order he issued Wednesday, on
Friday ordered their union to pay a $100,000-a-day fine if the
teachers and other employees don't return to work Monday. Teachers
would be hit with a $300-a-day fine, while school secretaries and
other workers would have to pay a daily fine of $50 for each
unexcused absence.
</P>
<P>
   Parrillo has scheduled a Monday afternoon hearing with lawyers
for both sides to determine his next steps, based on whether the
teachers are back in class and the progress of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials and some parents have argued that negotiators
for the 13,000-student district have not tried to meet the teachers
halfway.
</P>
<P>
   One parent voicing that opinion, Debbie Falsetti, was among the
estimated 2,000 people, including teachers from nearly every county
in the state, who turned out for Sunday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just believe that parents and teachers are a team, and I
think this whole thing is really sad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Davis, a first-grade teacher in Stanhope, Sussex County,
said she attended to support her fellow teachers ''because we all
work for the betterment of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, volunteers from the union took their cause to
Hamilton's shopping malls, supermarkets and other high-traffic
locations. They distributed fliers stating that Hamilton's starting
teacher pay is the lowest in the county, and that the ''fair
settlement'' teachers are seeking would cost the average homeowner
less than $15 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining has been under way for months, and the teachers have
been without a contract since June 30. Classes were to start
Wednesday morning, but teachers instead hit the picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement on whether schools will be open Monday will be
broadcast on the school's cable television station, and area radio
stations will be notified.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Athlete Given Ultimatum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Nigerian Olympic officials have told a
hurdler on the team that she must arrange -- and apparently pay for
-- the return of the body of her fiance, who was killed by a car in
Sydney last week.
</P>
<P>
   Glory Alozie, considered one of Nigeria's best medal chances,
flew in on Friday night, a day after 400-meter runner Hyginus Anugo
was fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian Olympic officials said in a statement Sunday that
Anugo, a 22-year-old relay squad reserve, was not the team's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, signed by Nigerian Olympic official Fidelis
Kaigama, expressed ''sadness'' over the death but failed to make
any form of commitment to returning his body or helping his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anything to do with him because he was one of
those asked to go home who chose to stay back,'' an unidentified
Nigerian official told Australian Associated Press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Anugo, who was in Sydney at the request of his fiance, was
knocked down and killed instantly by a car while trying to run
across a street on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anugo was originally overlooked by Nigerian selectors in July
but added to the track squad at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   However, after Anugo had begun training with the relay squad in
Adelaide, he was dropped to the reserves last week. He was not
officially accredited for the games but had hoped to break into the
relay team by clocking impressive times during his stay in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Alozie, 23, is ranked second in the world in the 100-meter
hurdles and was in Japan for a Grand Prix when she heard of Anugo's
death.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Wins Canadian Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Tiger Woods has a shot for every
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed to the limits by an unlikely challenger, Woods completed
golf's great summer in style Sunday with a 6-iron from a fairway
bunker, over the water and right at the flag, to win the Canadian
Open by one stroke over Grant Waite.
</P>
<P>
   ''When pressure is at its peak, that's when your concentration
level is at its highest,'' Woods said. ''It builds to a
crescendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods chipped from the back of the green to a foot and tapped in
for birdie to close out a 7-under-par 65 and his fifth victory in
seven tournaments this summer. Three of them were majors, one of
them gave him the career Grand Slam and all of them were filled
with unforgettable shots.
</P>
<P>
   All five victories included some kind of scoring record -- 12
under at the U.S. Open, 19 under at the British, 18 under at the
PGA and a 21-under 259 at Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was 22 under over his final 49 holes and finished at 266,
the lowest 72-hole score in the 22 years that the Canadian Open has
been played at Glen Abbey Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had a wonderful summer,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly flawless on Sunday, and had to be. Waite, a
runner-up for the second straight week in Canada, matched him
stroke-for-stroke and put the pressure on with a 5-iron into the
par-5 18th green that left him a 20-foot eagle attempt that could
have forced a playoff or perhaps snatched a victory away from
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grant forced my hand,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went right at the flag, the ball landed about 18 feet
behind the hole. Waite missed his eagle try and had to settle for a
66 and one stroke short of winning, just like he was in Vancouver
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal was not to get too caught up in the hype,'' Waite
said. ''I gave him a run for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, neither player made a bogey and they combined for 13
birdies to turn the final round into a memorable duel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to beat him is to outplay him,'' Waite said.
''Right now, that's a difficult task. He's an extraordinary player
who comes along once every generation -- or his this case, maybe
once in forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods won for the third straight time, and for the ninth time
this year, the most PGA Tour victories in one year since Sam Snead
won 11 times in 1950. He earned $594,000, giving him more money in
his last 38 tournaments -- $14.9 million -- than anyone else in their
career.
</P>
<P>
   And Woods can now add the Triple Crown to the Grand Slam he
completed by winning the British Open at St. Andrews. He became the
only other player besides Lee Trevino in 1971 to win the U.S. Open,
British Open and Canadian Open in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the three oldest national championships in golf, all
of them conquered by a 24-year-old who knows no limits.
</P>
<P>
   And his knack for dramatic finishes has no end.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had the outright lead for only six holes in the
tournament. He grabbed it for good on the par-5 16th with a 12-foot
birdie putt. Woods pointed to the cup -- a gesture that has replaced
his famous fist pump -- as the ball disappeared to give him a
one-stroke lead with two holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   With rain starting to fall, Woods missed his first green on the
17th, but managed to blast out of the bunker to a foot to save par,
a tremendous shot since he had so little green between the sand and
the flag.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the pressure Waite applied at the end, Woods had an
answer -- much to Waite's disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy takes out a 6-iron, fires at the flag, with the
tournament on the line,'' he said, shaking his head in wonder. ''I
told him after we where through, 'You're not supposed to do that.
You're supposed to hit at the middle of the green.'
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'The shot was on.' I guess it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, who beat Woods 1-up in their made-for-TV
exhibition last week in California, had a 67 but was never a factor
and finished seven strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   Waite stayed with Woods the whole day, but fell victim to the
50,000 people who crammed into Glen Abbey. The click of cameras
from the gallery distracted him on his drive on the 16th and it
flared out to the right, leaving him no chance to reach the green
in two. He missed an 18-footer from the fringe, and Woods took
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you make a mistake, he'll leave you,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods now has 24 tour victories in a career that spans just over
four years. And he gets a much-deserved break -- taking the next
five weeks off before The Presidents Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Waite had played with Woods was the 1993
Nelson Classic, where they both missed the cut. Of course, Woods
was still in high school and so much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who became the youngest player to complete the Grand
Slam, has become the biggest star in sports and draws galleries
more suited for major championships everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Waite's goal was to simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep putting one foot in front of the other,'' he had said
after the third round. He wound up going stride for stride, and
stroke for stroke, with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   They were tied after nine, and remained that way, matching
birdies on the 13th and 14th. Neither player missed a green until
Waite found the fringe on No. 15, but both made pars.
</P>
<P>
   Because three of the final six holes are par-5s -- and no one
hits the ball as long as Woods -- it figured to be only a matter of
time before he wound up a winner once again.
</P>
<P>
   Waite gave him a stiffer test than anyone imagined, but was done
in by one bad swing on the 16th. Against Woods, that's usually one
too many.
</P>
<P>
   DIVOTS: Waite was the only player to record four rounds in the
60s. ... Because heavy rain was in the forecast, the ''lift, clean
and place'' policy was in effect for the final round. ... Frank
Nobilo made a hole-in-one on No. 3, a 7-iron from 156 yards and won
a 2001 Lincoln LS. It also helped him to a 67, his best round of
the year since his first round of the year (Hope Classic). ...
Derek Gillespie was the low Canadian, close with a 71 for 283. Mike
Weir, who had never made the cut in nine previous Canadian Opens,
was 73-74 on the weekend and finished at 290. ... Woods is now 22-2
worldwide when he has at least a share of the 54-hole lead.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Rulers Urge Peace  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's Taliban rulers urged
opposition forces Sunday to lay down their arms to allow an end to
the war as fighting raged between on two northern fronts after
advances last week by Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge the opposition to stop fighting and lay down their
weapons for peace,'' Taliban commander Mullah Abdul Mannan told The
Associated Press at the Old Road front, 30 miles north of the
capital Kabul, where the sides exchanged artillery fire overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Vans loaded with bearded Taliban warriors carrying assault
rifles and rocket launchers were seen rumbling toward the fighting
on the battered road.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country has seen enough of bloodshed,'' Mannan said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from the opposition, In the
past, it has rejected such calls by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who follow a strict version of Islam, now rule more
than 90 percent of Afghanistan, including Kabul. They are Sunni
Muslims and mostly Pashtun, the country's majority ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition consists of ethnic and religious minorities and
controls the northern province of Badakshan and small pockets in a
few northern areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban captured the city of Taloqan, 162 miles north of
Kabul, on Wednesday in a major blow to the opposition, and since
the two sides have been fighting at a standstill around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, the Taliban tried to advance toward Ahandara, 9
miles north of Taloqan, but were beaten back after several hours of
fighting, the opposition said. There was no details of casualties,
and the Taliban did not confirm the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Abil, a spokesman of the anti-Taliban alliance, said
opposition fighters destroyed several Taliban posts overnight in a
guerrilla attack north of Kabul. ''At least eight Taliban were
killed and several wounded,'' he said by telephone from the
northern province of Takhar. ''All our fighters came back safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannan denied any losses, saying the two sides pounded each
other only with artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, has been
devastated by two-decades of civil war. The factions have rejected
repeated pleas by the United Nations for an end to the conflict and
formation of a broad-based government.

<HEADLINE> Parents Brawl at Girls Soccer Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- A tied soccer game between 8- and
9-year-old girls ended in a brawl among their parents Sunday after
a disagreement over where a coach was standing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A shootout was to take place between the teams -- one from Staten
Island, N.Y., and the other from North Hunterdon -- but before it
could, a Staten Island coach argued that a North Hunterdon coach
shouldn't be allowed to stand behind the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The argument escalated into a fistfight with as many as a dozen
parents and coaches involved. No children were involved, South
Brunswick police Officer Jim Ryan said. Even after police arrived,
parents were still yelling at each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said a coach and a parent claimed to have been assaulted,
but no one was seriously injured or arrested, police said. Both
teams were escorted from the field, and neither was declared the
game winner, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was just the latest case of parental rage at youth
sporting events this year. In August, a hockey dad was indicted on
manslaughter charges in the beating death of another father at a
game in Massachusetts, and a baseball coach was accused of breaking
an umpire's jaw after a disputed call in Florida in June.

<HEADLINE> Long Shot Riviera Wins Atto Mile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Riviera made it worth the wait Sunday at the $1
million Atto Mile.
</P>
<P>
   The French-bred delayed the start of the race at Woodbine by
nearly five minutes after repeatedly refusing to assume his No. 13
position in the starter's gate. Noticeably agitated, the 10-1 long
shot looked every bit like a non-contender, starting poorly and
sitting a distant sixth with a quarter mile remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But jockey John Velazquez got the 6-year-old to swing out wide
at the turn and took the lead in the deep stretch before holding
off a hard-charging Arkadian Hero by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   ''They keep a truck running back there to get power for the gate
and once he got close he really didn't like it,'' Velazquez said of
Riviera's problems entering the gate. ''Once he got in, he didn't
break as sharply as he usually does and I was just trying to keep
him together and save some ground around the turn and pull him out.
But when I pulled him out, he really responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Riviera's win was the ninth in 17 career starts -- all on grass.
He was timed in 1:33 on a firm course and earned American owner
Edmond Gann $600,000. Riviera returned $23.10, $10.90 and $7.30.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in as many weeks, trainer Bobby Frankel had a
horse finished first in a $1 million stakes race. The others were
the Arlington Million (with Chester House) and Del Mar Handicap
(with Northern Quest).
</P>
<P>
   Frankel plans to enter Riviera in this year's Breeders' Cup Mile
and is hopeful the horse can earn him his first race victory.
Frankel has finished second in that event four times.
</P>
<P>
   Arkadian Hero returned $24.90 and $11.10. Affirmed Success was
third, 1&AMP;frac12; lengths behind, and returned $5.20.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 13 horses -- including six from Canada -- started.

<HEADLINE> Adamov: Sub Reactors Pose No Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's atomic energy minister insisted Sunday
that radiation leaks from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk are
all but impossible, citing normal radiation levels at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on ORT television, Yevgeny Adamov said no leakage would
occur even ''in the most fantastic, most extreme scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine sank in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, devastated by
an explosion. The blast raised fears that the Kursk's reactors had
been damaged and would spread radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reactors' automatic safety system cut them off and they
are now in such a condition that no radiation or nuclear
consequences might happen,'' Adamov said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine's power plant ''proved to be the most reliable
technical part of the object,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All 118 crew members aboard the Kursk died in the accident.
Russia has said it plans to raise the submarine from the 340-foot
depths, but the operation is expected to take about a year. The
victims' bodies are to be removed in an operation planned to begin
this autumn.

<HEADLINE> Knight Had Wild 28 Years at Indiana  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   For just about every victory Bob Knight brought to Indiana there
was a confrontation, an outburst, a chilling glare.
</P>
<P>
   The three NCAA championships were offset by the chair, the choke
and a last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 Big Ten titles were matched by tirades, technicals and
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   After 28 seasons of success and controversy, the Bob Knight Era
is over at Indiana and it's very unlikely there will ever be
another tenure like his anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only two schools -- UCLA with 11 and Kentucky with seven -- have
won more than the three national championships Knight won with
Indiana in 1976, 1981 and 1987. The 1976 team -- considered one of
the best in college basketball history -- is the last to finish a
season unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was never a highlight moment from that perfect season
that was shown when Knight was talked about. Instead, it was the
replay of Knight throwing an orange plastic chair across the court
in a game against Purdue in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five months the grainy tape of Knight placing his
hand on Neil Reed's throat at practice in 1997 was shown many more
times than the clip of Keith Smart sticking that corner jumper in
the Superdome to give Indiana its most recent title.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of keeping count of how many wins Knight needs to pass
Dean Smith as college basketball's winningest coach -- 116 -- people
will be recounting how many transgressions there were from May 15,
the day the zero-tolerance policy went into effect, until Sunday,
when school president Myles Brand recalled the phone conversation
that ended a nearly three-decade long relationship.
</P>
<P>
   It was just three years after his playing career at Ohio State
ended in 1962 with a third straight Final Four appearance that
Knight was appointed head coach at West Point. The military academy
seemed a perfect fit for a taskmaster who believed in discipline.
His final season at Army, 1970-71, was his only losing one in six
years there.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomington campus, the Big Ten Conference and the college
basketball world would never be the same after Robert Montgomery
Knight was selected as Indiana's coach that day in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The state that professes a love for basketball unlike any other
had no problem adopting an Ohioan. The wins were great and the
motion offense and intense man-to-man defense were pure basketball.
The no-nonsense approach to life on and off the court was perfect
for the Midwest in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The championships made it even better. It wasn't a joke when
people said Bob Knight was the most popular man in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Knight grabbing player Jim Wisman by the shirt after a couple of
turnovers made a graphic photo but was forgiven as a coach making a
point.
</P>
<P>
   A run-in with Puerto Rico police during the 1979 Pan American
Games was explained as a misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there were more and more problems to explain. The
second national championship was marred when Knight threw an LSU
fan into a garbage can. The detractors' number started to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The coach added the Olympic gold medal to his resume in 1984 but
was criticized for a run-in with an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came things like an outburst against a moderator at an NCAA
news conference, the displaying of a bull whip, kicking his son on
the bench, an accidental head butt of a player and the growing list
of players who transferred out of the program.
</P>
<P>
   When the tape of Knight grabbing Reed surfaced, a 763-289 record
and a squeaky clean record with the NCAA wasn't good enough to hold
off the critics any longer.
</P>
<P>
   The school instituted the zero-tolerance policy in May and the
grabbing of a student's arm Thursday was the last of several
violations that led to Knight's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Following a college basketball coaching legend has never been
easy at any school. Succeeding Knight at Indiana -- whether it's
someone in house as the current players want or an outsider -- will
not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The microscope and zero-tolerance policy will still be there,
along with one of the best records any coach ever put together.

<HEADLINE> Knight Supporters March in Defiance  </HEADLINE>
By REX W. HUPPKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- They were Knight's army, marching from
Assembly Hall to the home of the Indiana University president who
had fired the basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, hey, ho, ho. Myles Brand has got to go,'' some students
chanted. ''Burn in hell, Brand,'' said a banner hanging from a
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Someone ignited an effigy of Kent Harvey, the freshman whose
Thursday run-in with Knight at Assembly Hall triggered a weekend of
news conferences, investigations and meetings that ended with Bob
Knight's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the firing Sunday brought students to the arena
where banners celebrate Knight's three national championships. The
students cursed Brand. Then, thousands strong, marched about a half
mile to the president's home at the heart of the campus while
police in riot gear stood watch.
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour of Brand's announcement, car horns blared and
chants of ''We love Bobby'' echoed off the limestone walls of the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   James Turner, a 21-year-old senior from Fort Wayne, grabbed a
bullhorn outside Assembly Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born in the state of Indiana, I've lived here all my
life, and I don't ever want to be anywhere else. But today I'm
ashamed to call myself a Hoosier,'' Turner said, bringing loud
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Osman held up a red university flag on which she
scrawled: ''The spineless political institution of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Indiana University as an institution caved in to
pressure from the outside world, specifically the media, instead of
doing what's best for the IU community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, someone ignited a pile of red and white Indiana
apparel in the arena's parking lot. A police officer moved in with
a fire extinguisher. Security guards videotaped the action.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Schildkret, 18, could not contain his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the freshmen, we came here to see Bobby. Now we can't see
him. It's ridiculous,'' Schildkret said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Memorial Student Union, students had watched Brand's news
conference on TV. Shilin Chiu, a 20-year-old senior, recalled a
recent trip to San Francisco where she was asked about the man who,
for many people, has come to represent Indiana University. Things
will change now that Knight's gone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the university will gain more recognition,'' Chiu
said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's players had left the campus to drive to Indianapolis to
watch Brand's news conference and ponder whether to finish their
college careers wearing Indiana's cream and crimson uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize that IU is a great university, but we came here to
play for coach Knight,'' junior forward Tom Geyer said. ''Right
now, you just have to consider what all your options are.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the news conference, Brand informed Gov. Frank O'Bannon
of his decision to fire Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have known Bob Knight for many years and am personally
saddened by this outcome and the chain of events that led to it,''
O'Bannon said. ''Nonetheless, I am confident that IU's action today
is in the best interest of the university, and I fully support its
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Alford, the star of Knight's 1987 championship team and
now the coach at Big Ten rival Iowa, said Bloomington would not be
the same for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always seen Indiana University and coach Knight as one
in the same,'' Alford said.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State coach Tom Izzo acknowledged Knight could have
conducted himself better.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the great things he's done and the wonderful things he's
accomplished far outweigh the bad,'' Izzo said.

<HEADLINE> Key Dates in Wen Ho Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   March 8, 1999: Energy Department fires computer
scientist Wen Ho
Lee from Los Alamos National Laboratory after three-year espionage
investigation over alleged disclosure of sensitive nuclear missile
technology to China in the 1980s. Lee denies providing secrets to
anyone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   April 10, 1999: FBI agents search Lee's home, hauling away boxes
of evidence in their investigation into whether nuclear weapons
secrets were leaked to China.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 1, 1999: Lee, in an interview with CBS' ''60 Minutes,''
said it was common practice for scientists to transfer secret
information from classified to unclassified computers. He said he
is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1999: After hearing evidence for several months, a
grand jury in Albuquerque, N.M., issues a 59-count indictment
accusing Lee of removing nuclear secrets from a secured Los Alamos
computer. Lee is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 13, 1999: U.S. Magistrate Don Svet rules that releasing Lee
on bail would pose a ''clear and present danger to the national
security of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 20, 1999: Lee sues the FBI and the Justice and Energy
departments, alleging they violated his privacy and wrongly
portrayed him as a Chinese spy.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 29, 1999: U.S. Judge James Parker denies bail for Lee,

<P>
   Sept. 1: Appeals court halts Lee's release. Parker writes,

<HEADLINE> Barak hints at further concessions to Palestinians, in attempt to revive talks </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested
Sunday he would consider less than full Israeli sovereignty over
the key holy site in Jerusalem's Old City revered by Muslims and
Jews, in a bid to keep alive hopes for a peace treaty with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches and interviews, Barak also outlined a solution for
sharing the disputed city that appeared to go beyond what Israel
has offered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to the Palestinians, he reminded them of the
benefits of a peace treaty, including the establishment of a widely
recognized Palestinian state and a massive international aid
package for Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ''has to move,'' Barak told ABC
This Week. ''In a way, it's now or never.'' Barak has said only
four or five weeks remained to forge a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak spoke, the top Palestinian policy-making body decided
to put off a declaration of statehood for at least two months, in a
bid to give faltering peace talks a chance. The decision, taken in
Gaza City with Arafat in attendance, defused possible confrontation
with Israel, which had threatened retaliation for a possible
unilateral move.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks have been stalled because of rival sovereignty
claims to a 36-acre sacred compound in Jerusalem's Old City. It is
known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the biblical Temples,
and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, with two
major mosques marking the spot where in Muslim tradition the
Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have insisted on full sovereignty over
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its
holy sites. Israel has rejected the demand, but has said it was
ready to hand over some parts of the eastern sector to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak suggested Sunday that while he would not agree to
Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount, he would not
necessarily insist on formal Israeli rule there, either. ''Somehow,
a formula should be found that would not contradict both
statements,'' he said, referring to rival sovereignty claims.
</P>
<P>
   In listing areas in east Jerusalem that must remain under
Israeli sovereignty, he mentioned the Western Wall - a Temple
remnant that runs along the mosque compound - but not the Temple
Mount itself.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing American Jewish leaders, Barak outlined in greatest
detail yet how he envisioned sharing east Jerusalem. Israel would
annex three major West Bank settlements near the city, as well as
11 Jewish neighborhoods built in east Jerusalem after Israel
captured the sector in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Israel would seek sovereignity over the Western Wall, the Mount
of Olives with its large Jewish cemetery, the City of David
archaeological site, ''and all other places that are important to
us,'' Barak told the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations on the last day of his weeklong New York visit.
</P>
<P>
   He made no reference to seeking sovereignty over the Palestinian
neighborhoods in east Jerusalem that are home to more than 200,000
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Nabil Aburdeneh turned down Barak's ideas, saying
the Palestinians would not accept Israeli sovereignty over any part
of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   However, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath confirmed for the
first time Sunday that in his meeting with President Clinton last
week, Arafat raised his own compromise proposal concerning the
Haram as-Sharif mosque compound.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told Clinton he was ready to accept Islamic sovereignty
by the countries of the Jerusalem Committee, including Egypt,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, over the site, with the
Palestinians receiving actual jurisdiction. ''The first reaction of
President Clinton was not encouraging,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said last week that lower-level
negotiations were to resume Sunday. However, Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said he was told by his Israeli counterpart, Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, that talks would not begin until after
Barak's return to Israel on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hoosiers Plan To Stay Together  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HOSKINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   No defections appear imminent among the players recruited to the
Indiana University basketball team by fired coach Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of Knight's players attended Sunday's news conference
where university president Myles Brand announced the firing. Some
hung their heads while others glared at the dozens of reporters
fixed on Brand's words. A couple wiped away tears.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Dane Fife said the players hope to stay together and win a
championship for Knight this season.
</P>
<P>
   They looked to two assistant coaches, Mike Davis and John
Treloar, to keep the team together.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as we keep them here and as long as we're here he
isn't really gone. This is Coach's team,'' forward Kirk Haston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was fired for a ''pattern of unacceptable behavior'' at
Indiana. He will be replaced by an interim coach for the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jared Jeffries, one of the nation's top high school
prospects last season, said he came to Indiana because of Knight
and believed the coach wasn't given a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to see. You want to see all great men go out on
top,'' Jeffries said.
</P>
<P>
   Players later told reporters they would stay together through
the upcoming season if Davis and Treloar continue to coach the
team.
</P>
<P>
   They also want a say in the new coach, said reserve forward Tom
Geyer, one of Knight's strongest supporters on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The university would consider the players' input, but ''you have
to be open-minded and do what is best for the institution,''
athletic director Clarence Doninger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the team can't call the shots, but we want their
input.''

<HEADLINE> Gov. Rossello Signs Vote Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico's governor signed a law
Sunday allowing islanders to cast ballots in U.S. presidential
elections, although it was unclear whether their votes would
actually count.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello said in a statement the bill gave residents
of the U.S. territory the opportunity ''to make their voices heard,
along with their genuine desire to participate fully in the
approaching democratic processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Local legislators approved the bill last week following a U.S.
District Court ruling that Puerto Ricans have the right to vote for
president. Judge Jaime Pieras ordered the local government to
prepare presidential ballots for the upcoming Nov. 7 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling challenges Puerto Rico's peculiar relationship with
the United States, in which islanders are U.S. citizens but do not
vote for president and have only a non-voting delegate in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The law adds a fourth ballot to the elections for legislature,
governor and municipal posts. About 2.4 million of Puerto Rico's
3.8 million people are registered to vote, and the island typically
has a voter turnout of more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the new law has been largely ignored in Washington, it has
created a storm within Puerto Rico. Pro-independence activists and
supporters of the current commonwealth arrangement fear the law is
a step toward making the island the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Martin, vice president of the Puerto Rican Independence
Party, said statehood opponents would challenge the bill in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our opinion this is an unconstitutional bill,'' Martin
said. He argued all changes to the U.S.-Puerto Rico relationship
must be put to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-commonwealth gubernatorial candidate Sila Calderon called
the vote ''a deception,'' saying she believes a higher court will
overturn Pieras' ruling. She said she would not be voting for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony until the United States won it
in 1898 Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens
under the Jones Act of 1917 and were ruled by a governor designated
by the United States until 1952.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton Threatens Burger King  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton said Sunday he will call for a
boycott of Burger King if the world's No. 2 fast-food chain does
not discuss its attempt to revoke a black owner's franchises.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on Detroit restaurant owner La-Van Hawkins,
who filed a $500 million lawsuit against Burger King in April. He
alleged the restaurant courted him because of his race for a deal
to open 225 inner-city restaurants and then used it against him to
squelch his dream of owning a large string of Burger Kings in
underserved communities.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King countersued five days later. The restaurant wants
Hawkins to return its property and says he owes more than $6.5
million from a loan given in 1998. Hawkins has also been sued by
suppliers who say he has not paid his bills.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Burger King has committed of pattern of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Burger King is pulling a whopper over the black community,''
Sharpton said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials would not comment Sunday on Sharpton's
proposed boycott, but spokeswoman Kim Miller denied race plays any
part in the company's dealings with Hawkins, which she called
''strictly business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also said he will call for the boycott if Burger King
does not agree to hire both a minority-owned investment firm to
handle a portion of its proposed stock offering and a
minority-owned advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights activist said he would go to New York's Wall
Street on Monday to announce a five-day countdown to the boycott,
which would begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said minority communities spend millions of dollars
annually at Burger King. He said it is unfair that minority
advertising agencies and investment firms do not get a cut of the
company's business.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said two of the company's three advertising agencies are
minority-owned. She had no knowledge of what investment firms have
been contacted to handle the stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   When Hawkins' deal with Burger King was announced in 1996, the
ceremony was at the White House and hailed as an example of black
entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   The possible boycott adds to Burger King's recent troubles.
Parent company Diageo PLC, a European conglomerate, is looking to
spin off 20 percent of Burger King, which has angered independent
franchise operators.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Debra Messing, Stockard Channing and Molly
Shannon shimmered in red satin dresses on the red carpet at
Sunday's Emmy Awards. Camryn Manheim defied the sizzling
temperatures in gray flannel.
</P>
<P>
   No one color or style dominated the pre-Emmy fashion parade that
runs second only to Oscar night as Hollywood's biggest excuse to
dress up.
</P>
<P>
   Messing, nominated for leading comedy actress in ''Will &AMP;
Grace,'' accessorized her strapless red ball gown with new husband
Daniel Zelman. She showed him off as much as other actresses
displayed their borrowed million-dollar jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim, star of ''The Practice,'' worked her way through the
gridlock of celebrities and publicists outside the Shrine
Auditorium in a long gray flannel dress and matching wrap by Ralph
Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to be cutting edge,'' Manheim said. ''I put this on at
2:45 and I was here at 3:30. Time management.''
</P>
<P>
   Newlyweds Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, a first-time Emmy
nominee for ''Friends,'' drew screams from fans in the couple's
first major Hollywood appearance since their July wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston chose a long salmon satin gown and wore her long hair
straight -- a change from last year's piles of curls.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Mullally of ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' winner of the Emmy for
supporting comedy actress, wore a jeweled butterfly ring that
covered most of her right hand. Wearing a crinkled navy dress with
a plunging V-neckline, Mullally joked she needed a towel to mop up
the sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Heaton hardly resembled the housewife-mom she plays on
''Everybody Loves Raymond.'' Heaton's body-hugging, low-cut dress
featured yellow stitched flowers and silver beading with black bra
straps. A platinum-and-diamond cross hung around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I dress this way when I go to rehearsal and I have to take it
off when we tape,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Cattrall, a supporting comedy actress nominee for ''Sex and
the City,'' set off her gray matte jersey long skirt with a gray
beaded top with cap sleeves by Randolph Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I wanted was to feel really comfortable and relaxed,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker, Cattrall's co-star on ''Sex and the
City,'' floated in a short dress with a full skirt accented by pale
pink feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Leeves of ''Frasier,'' who is expecting a baby in January,
wore a simple deep-purple long dress held up by a single spaghetti
strap that formed a V.
</P>
<P>
   Several cast members of ''Survivor'' arrived separately and
received some of the loudest cheers. Rudy Boesch, Gervase Peterson
and million-dollar winner Richard Hatch strode the red carpet
wearing more clothes than they ever did during their island
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a madhouse,'' said Boesch, the ex-Navy Seal who was
accompanied by his wife Marge. ''I never seen nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson wore a black tuxedo, but pointed out that his silver
hoop earring and silver watch were his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just soaking up the festivities,'' he said. ''Who would've
ever thought I could be here?''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Braugher of ''Homicide'' had the best perspective on his
fashion role at the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an evening for the ladies,'' he said. ''We men are the
backdrop to the stunning outfits.''

<HEADLINE> Chileans March in Coup Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Thousands of Chileans marched in a
downpour Sunday to recall the 27th anniversary of the bloody coup
led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, demanding the former dictator be
brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a heavy police presence, demonstrators walked 2&AMP;frac12; miles from
downtown Santiago to the cemetery where Salvador Allende, the
Marxist president who committed suicide during the coup against
him, lies buried.
</P>
<P>
   Cold and a steady rain did not dampen the spirits of the
leftists, human rights activists and families of those who died
during Pinochet's dictatorship, many of whom carried banners
demanding his prosecution. Police said between 4,000 and 5,000
people took part in the march.
</P>
<P>
   The way was opened this summer to the possibility of a Pinochet
trial -- something long viewed as inconceivable -- when the general
was stripped of the immunity from prosecution that he enjoyed as a
senator for life. The Supreme Court announced in August that it
upheld a lower court decision to end the immunity.
</P>
<P>
   An official report after Pinochet left power in 1990 said 3,197
people died or disappeared under his right-wing military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Allende killed himself on Sept. 11, 1973, rather than surrender
to the coup leaders as the takeover was in under way. Pinochet took
power and ruled for more than 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, socialists gathered on the side of the presidential
palace at the exact site where Allende's body was found 27 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other commemorations, socialist President Ricardo Lagos
attended a Roman Catholic Mass to remember Allende in the chapel at
the presidential palace, La Moneda. He was joined by Allende's
widow, Hortensia Bussi, Cabinet ministers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Following the service, socialist Interior Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza said he had never seen the former strongman ''shed a tear''
for any of the abuses committed under his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet and leaders of the armed forces have said all along
that there has never been any reason to ask forgiveness for what
occurred. The former dictator has said he was fighting to save
Chile from chaos when he took power.
</P>
<P>
   Some 170 criminal complaints have been filed against Pinochet
and are now being investigated by a federal prosecutor, Judge Juan
Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   Among those cases, his opponents want to try Pinochet for the
October 1973 disappearances of 19 dissidents who were plucked from
their jail cells shortly after the coup and never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Myrella Garcia, who belongs to a group of families whose
relatives disappeared under the dictatorship, said this anniversary
still ''fills us with pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But in apparent allusion to Pinochet's legal battles, she said
''this year there is more hope and joy.''

<HEADLINE> 'The West Wing' Takes Lead at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC's ''The West Wing'' took the lead in
early returns at the Emmys on Sunday in a series of contests
pitting the political drama against HBO's ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schiff, who plays the grim aide Toby Ziegler, and
Allison Janney, who portrays the White House's tough press
secretary, won supporting actor awards. Series creator Aaron Sorkin
won for writing, and Thomas Schlamme for directing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love every member of my cast,'' Janney said. ''This should
be an ensemble award and I share it with all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Janney paid tribute to fellow nominee Nancy Marchand, who played
the scheming matriarch Livia Soprano in the HBO series. Marchand
died of lung cancer on June 18. Janney called Marchand ''exquisite,
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The West Wing'' has won a total of eight Emmys in its first
year, including four in technical categories. Many fans were
looking forward to its showdown with ''The Sopranos'' in the best
drama category.
</P>
<P>
   Two relatively new comedies, NBC's ''Will &AMP; Grace'' and Fox's
''Malcolm in the Middle,'' were award winners.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally of ''Will &AMP; Grace'' won best
supporting actor and actress. For both of them, it was their first
Emmy and gave the comedy bragging rights as it moves to a
high-profile slot on NBC's Thursday lineup this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you to the strong women in my category, who I've stolen
from frequently, and will continue to do so in the future,'' said
Mullally, who beat Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston of ''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Holland was saluted for directing ''Malcolm in the
Middle,'' and the show's writers also won Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Izzard won for both his performance and writing in his HBO
special, ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Top comedy nominees included ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' ''Everybody Loves
Raymond'' and ''Sex and the City.'' Awards in 27 categories were to
be given during the three-hour ceremony airing on ABC with host
Garry Shandling. It was the 52nd year the Emmys have been awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest television events of the past year -- ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' -- weren't competing Sunday.
''Millionaire'' was shunted off to the Daytime Emmys and
''Survivor'' missed the cutoff for nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Host Garry Shandling did a ''Survivor'' takeoff in his opening
segment, though, and several contestants were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest,''
Shandling said. ''I think real people should not be on television.
It's for special people like us, people who have trained and
studied to appear to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy watchers were anxious to see the impact of a change in
voting procedures designed to widen the voting panel and make it
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of requiring Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
members to watch nominated shows in a hotel, the academy sent out
videotapes for voters to watch at home. As a result, it nearly
quadrupled the number of people voting.
</P>
<P>
   Many actors, including John Lithgow and David Schwimmer, wore
gold ribbons in a show of support for the Screen Actors Guild and
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, who are
involved in a strike against the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   Among networks, NBC was the leading nominee with 95 bids. It was
followed by HBO with 86, ABC with 65, CBS with 42 and Fox with 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences ceremony was being
broadcast internationally and carried live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   In last month's creative arts ceremony, Emmy awards were
announced in 53 craft categories including outstanding
choreography, editing and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Four acting awards for guest roles were among those given out.
Bruce Willis was honored as outstanding guest actor in a comedy
series for his appearance on ''Friends,'' while Jean Smart was
named in the matching actress category for a turn on ''Frasier.''
Two veteran actors, James Whitmore and Beah Richards, received
trophies for appearances on the legal drama ''The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   For best commercial, the award went to Nike's ''The Morning
After.''

Barak Says Peace Concessions Possible

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested today he would
consider less than full Israeli sovereignty over the key holy site in
Jerusalem's Old City revered by Muslims and Jews. Barak is hopeful of keeping
alive a peace treaty with the Palestinians. Barak also outlined a solution for
sharing the disputed city that appeared to go beyond what Israel has offered in
the past.

that critics say will be unduly dominated by pro-Beijing forces and big
business. Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa wasn't even on the ballot but came under
harsh attack from voters who accuse him of bungling the governance of Hong Kong

firing at a news conference, called Knight ''defiant and hostile'' and said the
coach had shown a ''continued unwillingness'' to work within guidelines of the
athletic department. The final confrontation came last week when Knight grabbed
a student by the arm to lecture him about manners at Assembly Hall.

Sharpton Threatens Burger King

   MIAMI (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton said today he will call for a boycott of
Burger King if the world's No. 2 fast-food chain does not discuss its attempt to
revoke a black owner's franchises. The dispute centers on Detroit restaurant
owner La-Van Hawkins, who filed a $500 million lawsuit against Burger King in
April. He alleged the restaurant courted him because of his race for a deal to
open 225 inner-city restaurants and then used it against him to squelch his
dream of owning a large string of Burger Kings in underserved communities.
Burger King countersued and wants Hawkins to return its property.

Saints (1-1) moved 90 yards on 10 plays for the winning score, aided by a pass
interference call against cornerback DeRon Jenkins and an unnecessary roughness
call against safety Rodney Harrison for a hit on Andrew Glover.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 4, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Randy Johnson became the 12th player to reach the
3,000 strikeout plateau, fanning a season-high 14 in seven innings
Sunday before Preston Wilson's RBI single in the 12th inning gave
the Florida Marlins a 4-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, celebrating his 37th birthday, struck out the side in
the second, fourth and sixth innings before leaving with the score
tied at 3. He gave up six hits and one earned run, settling for his
fourth no-decision in his last nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks fell 4&AMP;frac12; games behind the New York Mets in the
NL wild card race. The Mets beat Philadelphia 3-0 on Sunday. The
Marlins, despite striking out a team-record 21 times -- one short on
the NL record -- snapped a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotsay beat out a drag bunt to start the 12th off Russ
Springer (2-4). His headfirst slide just beat Greg Colbrunn's tag.
Kotsay moved to second on Luis Castillo's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Springer intentionally walked Floyd, setting up Wilson's
game-ending hit that scored Kotsay from second base.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's bullpen allowed just one hit in the final five
innings. Braden Looper (5-1) got two outs in the 12th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson was the story of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell became Johnson's 3,000th victim, striking out on
four pitches to end the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett carried the ball into the dugout, while
Johnson walked off the field to a standing ovation. He raised his
black glove into the air, acknowledging the crowd's applause, as he
reached the dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored three runs -- one earned -- off Johnson in the
fifth inning. With one out, Mark Smith and Mike Redmond hit
back-to-back singles to put runners on the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith then hit a one-hopper back to the mound, but
Johnson's errant throw to second base was in the dirt and allowed
Smith to score. Dave Berg doubled with two outs, scoring Redmond
and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona answered with three runs in the sixth off Smith. Johnson
walked, moved to third on Jay Bell's one-out double and scored on
Luis Gonzalez's sacrifice fly. Greg Colbrunn followed with a
two-run home run, his 11th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first strikeout of the game, Marlins leadoff hitter
Luis Castillo, gave him 300 for the third consecutive season and
the fourth time overall.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan is the only other pitcher to strike out 300 in three
straight seasons, doing it in 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's four 300-strikeout seasons are second only to Ryan's
six.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The three runs the Marlins scored off Johnson in the fifth
inning were one more than they scored in their previous 24 innings.
... Wilson stuck out three times, giving him 174 this season and
leaving him 15 shy of Bobby Bonds' record set in 1970. ...
Including Sunday's 1 hour, 7 minute rain, the Marlins have had
eight rain delays at home this season, stopping play for 11 hours
and 27 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Elam Injures Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos kicker Jason Elam was taken to the
hospital Sunday after injuring his lower back while trying to make
a tackle against the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Elam, who shares the NFL record with a 63-yard field goal, had
to be helped from the field after safety Johndale Carty sent him
flying with a hard block along the sidelines late the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The hit occurred as Elam was chasing Darrick Vaughn during his
100-yard kickoff return. Elam lay on the ground for several minutes
and was unable to put any weight on his dangling right leg as he
was taken to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't know how Jason is, other than he's really
sore,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ''He got hit in the hip
and was having problems with his lower back, but at least it wasn't
a knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam was taken to a hospital and an MRI was scheduled for Sunday
or Monday. The Broncos hoped to know more about his status after
the test results.
</P>
<P>
   Grimacing noticeably, Elam appeared to be in severe pain as he
was taken to the locker room on a cart. The Broncos, who led 34-7
when he was injured, won 42-14 and did not attempt a field goal or
extra point in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tom Rouen handled Denver's only kickoff, and the Broncos
were successful on a 2-point conversion after a touchdown in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have hit Denver hard in the past week. Starting running
back Terrell Davis did not play Sunday because of a sprained left
ankle, and his backup, Olandis Gary, is out for the season with a
torn knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Al Wilson (separated shoulder) and defensive end
Kavika Pittman (pinched nerve) also missed Sunday's game, and
offensive lineman Trey Teague sprained his right knee in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey played sparingly while nursing a sore
groin, and tight end Byron Chamberlain did not return after
straining his left hamstring in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Olympian, 103, Returns Flag  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Eighty years after he shinnied up a
15-foot flagpole to grab a souvenir, a former Olympic diving
medalist handed back his ripped-off trinket -- the original Olympic
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Haig ''Harry'' Prieste, now 103 and confined to a wheelchair
most of the time, said Monday (Sunday night EDT) that he took the
flag as a dare at the 1920 Games in Antwerp, Belgium, and kept it
in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is now regarded as the first to feature the five rings
on a white background that have become the Olympic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste only discovered its importance during an interview at a
U.S. Olympic Committee awards dinner in 1997, when a reporter told
him the original flag had gone missing and never been located.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I ain't going to be around much longer -- it's no
good in a suitcase,'' Prieste said after handing the folded linen
flag to International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch at the start of the IOC's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was no good to me -- I won't be able to hang it up in my
room,'' said Prieste, who is considered the oldest living Olympic
medalist. ''People will think more of me for giving it away than
keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz introduced Prieste to the
session as a ''living legend,'' adding that he had run in the
Olympic torch relay at Atlanta in 1996 at the age of 100. At that
age he was still doing push ups and had just quit ice skating.
</P>
<P>
   He also was greeted by IOC member Jacques Rogge, a
representative of Belgium, where the flag was snatched.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is slightly discolored and is tattered along the edge
where Prieste ripped it off the flagpole, but otherwise in good
condition, the USOC said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, Prieste returned to California
and embarked on an entertainment career, becoming one of the
original Keystone Kops and appearing in 25 movies.
</P>
<P>
   He said Charlie Chaplin was a pal and that he was in the studio
when the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy was formed.
</P>
<P>
   He later moved to Broadway, working vaudeville before joining a
circus as a comedian and skating in the Ice Follies.
</P>
<P>
   Always the entertainer, Prieste, who is hard of hearing and
going blind, ensured he upstaged the IOC meetings going on inside
the Regent Hotel in downtown Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining some momentum after a slow start, the veteran showman
managed to stand up from his wheelchair on occasions and hold court
for a throng of reporters and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't want the curtain to come down when officials tried
to usher the impromptu press conference outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where's the TV camera gone,'' Prieste said as he was being
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   He flew into Sydney late Sunday, two days after leaving his
nursing home in Camden, N.J., and said he hopes to attend the
opening ceremony Friday before departing Australia next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud to be part of the ceremony,'' he said. ''When I give
(the flag) away, it makes me feel good, I made good use of the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be selfish about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn La Maina, a long-time friend who accompanied Prieste
Down Under, said the springboard bronze medalist from eight decades
ago still enjoyed pizza and root beer and the occasional
chocolate-coated cherry.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in great shape really, but he's losing his sight and he
can't hear very well, so his sense of taste gives him something to
live for,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Editor Regrets Clinton-Castro Chaos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Daily News said Sunday it regretted any
confusion caused by a front-page image that appeared to show
President Clinton and Cuban leader Fidel Castro about to shake
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders did shake hands and exchange brief greetings on
Wednesday after a United Nations luncheon, but there were no known
photographs of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News cover was a composite image made by sticking two
photos together. It appeared with a caption in some editions
saying, ''Clinton and Castro shared a handshake at the Millennium
summit this week,'' and the notation ''photo illustration.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The caption on the photo illustration should have directly
said that the image was not an actual photograph of the meeting,''
an editor's note in Sunday's paper said. ''The News regrets any
confusion the use of the photo illustration may have caused among
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's editor in chief, Ed Kosner, defended the cover
image after it appeared on Friday, saying that the newspaper wasn't
trying to misrepresent the photos and that the image was clearly
labeled as a photo illustration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said such a picture could undermine the
public's trust in journalism.

<HEADLINE> Boys soccer game turns into parent brawl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - A tied soccer game between 8- and
9-year-old boys ended in a brawl among their parents Sunday after a
disagreement over where a coach was standing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The argument began in Sondek Park about 4 p.m. after the two
teams, one from Staten Island, N.Y., and the other from North
Hunterdon, were tied at the end of regulation play, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A shootout was to take place between the teams, but before it
could, a Staten Island coach argued that a North Hunterdon coach
should not be permitted to stand behind the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The argument escalated into a fistfight with as many as a dozen
parents and coaches involved. No children were involved in the
brawl, according to South Brunswick police Officer Jim Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Police said even after they arrived, parents were still yelling
at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said a coach and a parent claimed to have been assaulted,
but no one was injured seriously or arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were escorted from the field, and neither was
declared the game winner, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said Sunday's soccer tournament was sponsored by the South
Brunswick Soccer Club, which has run the event without incident for
10 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Bashir Barghouti, a minister in the first
Palestinian cabinet and a veteran leader of the Palestinian
communist movement, died Saturday after a prolonged illness, a
Palestinian official said. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Although his party never had wide representation, Barghouti was
an influential ideologue who advocated establishment of a
Palestinian state alongside Israel at a time when other
Palestinians were calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Barghouti spent eight years in prisons in the 1950s and '60s for
his outspoken advocacy of Palestinian statehood. He supported armed
struggle against the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and was
a founder of the alliance of Palestinian groups set up to fight the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Palestinian Authority was established in the
wake of the Oslo agreements with Israel, Barghouti was appointed
transportation minister. He resigned a year later after a stroke
left him bedridden and unable to speak. Arafat appointed him
minister of state, an honorary position.
David Elliott Bell:
</P>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- David Elliott Bell, a former adviser to
Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson,
died Wednesday of natural causes. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Bell served as administrative assistant to President Truman from
1951 until after the 1952 presidential election. Bell then became
economic adviser and project field supervisor for the Harvard
Advisory Group.
</P>
<P>
   He helped the government of Pakistan develop its first
long-range economic plan. He was appointed director of the U.S.
Bureau of the Budget by Kennedy in 1961, and was administrator of
the U.S. Agency for International Development under Kennedy and
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   From 1981 to 1988, Bell was a professor at Harvard. He was also
on the board of Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan.
Julian Critchley:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Outspoken former lawmaker Sir Julian Critchley,
who clashed with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over
Europe and eventually left the Conservative Party because he felt
it was too anti-European, died Saturday morning. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   He had been suffering from bone and prostate cancer and had been
diagnosed with a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley, who had represented Aldershot in southern England for
the Conservative Party since 1964, quit Parliament before the last
national elections in 1997, which saw Tony Blair's Labor Party
sweep the Tories from power after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he supported former defense secretary Michael
Heseltine's bid to wrest leadership of the Conservative Party from
Thatcher. Heseltine failed, but the leadership contest fatally
weakened Thatcher, and the party ousted her as prime minister and
party leader later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley was knighted in 1995 by Thatcher's successor, John
Major.
George Edmund Sandell:
</P>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, California (AP) -- George Edmund Sandell, a noted
violin and viola player, teacher and inventor, died Aug. 26. He was
88.
</P>
<P>
   Sandell studied in New York under the viola virtuoso William
Primrose and on scholarship at the Royal Swedish Conservatory in
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Sandell moved to Los Angeles in 1938, where he played with the
Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Pasadena and Santa Monica
Symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   Along with classical music, he performed pop, swing and Latin
music, and played with the string sections of big band luminaries
Harry James, Jimmy Dorsey and Xavier Cugat.
</P>
<P>
   Sandell also played on some of Frank Sinatra's recordings and
worked for most of the big Hollywood studios on orchestral sound
tracks, including the sound track for the movie Citizen Kane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, he invented the Gee-Bee, a kitchen sponge with a
plastic handle for washing dishes. He sold the company to DuPont in
1953.

<HEADLINE> Titans' McNair Has Bruised Chest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair will
spend the night in a hospital after injuring his chest Sunday on a
hit by Kansas City defensive end Duane Clemons.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays Sunday showed no broken bones in McNair's bruised
sternum, said Robbie Bohren, the Titans' media director.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now everything looks fine,'' Bohren said. ''He's going
to stay in the hospital overnight so they can do one more test in
the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohren said he was uncertain what the test was and knew only
that it is more detailed than X-rays and will be used to rule out
any fracture. ''We'll know more tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who had been hit repeatedly by the Chiefs, was
scrambling on third-and-12 play in the fourth quarter when he was
knocked to the ground by Clemons. McNair walked off the field, then
laid down on the ground for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It concerned me when I saw him laying on the sideline, and I
hope that he is not seriously hurt,'' Titans running back Eddie
George said.
</P>
<P>
   McNair was helped to the bench where he sat for a couple more
minutes before being carted off for X-rays. But the X-rays were
inconclusive, and McNair was taken to Baptist Hospital for further
tests as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ''He actually took a helmet to the chest,'' Titans coach Jeff
Fisher said. ''He was having troubles taking deep breaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil O'Donnell replaced McNair and rallied the Titans from a
14-7 deficit to a 17-14 overtime victory. O'Donnell, who went 4-1
filling in while McNair recuperated from back surgery last season,
said he has been trying to teach McNair how to slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve's a tough guy, and he'll bounce back from it,''
O'Donnell said. ''We just have to wait and see. I've been trying to
teach him for two years how to slide.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair was sacked twice and hit repeatedly by the Chiefs. He was
11-of-18 for 93 yards and two interceptions. O'Donnell was 11-of-17
for 132 yards and a touchdown.

<HEADLINE> 3 Malaysians Missing After Raid  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN YOONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Gunmen stormed an island resort
off northeastern Borneo, and three Malaysians were missing after
the assailants fled in a speedboat toward Philippine waters, police
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred late Sunday on Padanan island -- not far from
Sipadan, where Philippine guerrillas raided a diving resort in
April and snatched 21 people, including foreign tourists, sparking
a drawn-out hostage drama in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Police were trying to determine if the gunmen in the Padanan
attack had taken the Malaysians hostage, Sulaiman Junaidi, police
chief in Semporna town, told The Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Semporna, the coastal fishing town in Malaysia's
Sabah state closest to Padanan, believe the Malaysians could have
gone into hiding in a nearby forest when the attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   There were no guests present at the resort during the attack,
Sulaiman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels behind the Sipadan kidnapping held their
hostages for months in the southern Philippine island of Jolo. All
have since been released except for a Filipino who had been working
at the resort.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have feared that the Abu Sayyaf rebels, who received
millions of dollars in ransom from negotiators, might return to
Malaysian waters again.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian authorities have pledged to beef up security in the
waters surrounding Sipadan, but warned that intruders who are
familiar with the territory might slip by easily.
</P>
<P>
   During the attack at Pasir Dive Resort on Padanan late Sunday
night, at least four gunmen armed with M-16 rifles took the local
staff by surprise and fired shots in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen held the staff up for 10 minutes, The Star newspaper
said in its online edition. They reportedly stole electronic
components from television sets, video tape recorders and radios
before escaping in a blue speedboat.
</P>
<P>
   The three missing men comprised an ethnic Chinese, an Indian and
an indigenous Kadazan, a spokesman for the Semporna Ocean Center
told the AP by telephone. They were believed to be the island
resort manager, a diving instructor and a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, who only wanted to be identified as Gan, said
that Padanan was nearly half-an-hour to the nearest Philippine
island by speedboat. Sipadan is an hour away by boat.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to add state designator  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - ''Now and forever'' is here and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats,'' Broadway's longest running show, hung up its whiskers,
tails and toe shoes Sunday after nearly 18 years and a record 7,485
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight is the last night of 'Cats'' first life on Broadway,''
its composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, said after the cast and
orchestra players took their bows to a screaming, cheering
audience. ''So I wouldn't get too excited. I don't quite know what
the fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   And fuss, they did. The standing ovations started even before
the show began when Lloyd Webber took his seat in the Winter Garden
Theater, where the musical first opened on Oct. 7, 1982. Cheers
continued throughout the performance, with sustained applause after
every song.
</P>
<P>
   One theatergoer yelled ''Go for it,'' as the company began ''The
Jellicle Ball,'' a big dance number near the end of the first act.
It was the night's longest standing ovation, literally stopping the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage with Lloyd Webber were director Trevor Nunn,
choreographer Gillian Lynne and producer Cameron Mackintosh. As
they waved goodbye, a shower of yellow, white and silver confetti
filled the theater, covering the cast and still-applauding
theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional weekend at the Winter Garden, starting with
the Saturday matinee where the audience included alumni from the
musical's Broadway and touring productions. The Saturday evening
performance was a special benefit for the Actors' Fund, the theater
service organization that takes care of entertainment
professionals. And the final performance Sunday was by invitation
only.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' is based on ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,'' a
collection of poems by T.S. Eliot, who even though he died in 1965,
received a Tony Award 18 years later for his contributions to the
score. His widow became a very wealthy woman, receiving royalties
from a show that has grossed more than $380 million on Broadway
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The musical began the dominance of the big British musical on
Broadway, an influence that has started to slip - ''Miss Saigon''
also will close New Year's Eve - but may never fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, two others - 'Les Miserables' and 'The Phantom of
the Opera' - are still with us,'' theater historian Ken Mandelbaum
said. ''And one, if not two, may eventually pass 'Cats' in
longevity. 'Phantom' only has six years to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' was considered quite unusual when it first opened on
Broadway, Mandelbaum said. ''It wasn't a book musical. It was all
music and very dependent on dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the musical became the show people loved to
hate, with everyone from Letterman to Leno making fun of its pop
score, lavish setting, and those furry creatures crawling all over
the stage and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''If 'Cats' had only run four or five years, there wouldn't have
been the resentment again it,'' Mandelbaum says. ''People didn't
want it to be the longest running show,'' especially after it took
the long-run crown away from a homegrown product, ''A Chorus
Line,'' in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, audiences came, singing ''Memory,'' the show's most
persistent melody, sung in the show by Grizabella, the musical's
faded glamour cat. She climbs in the show's final moments to ''the
heavy-side layer,'' a feline version of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' went out with a roar rather than a meow.
</P>
<P>
   The show originally was to have closed June 25, but a surge in
ticket sales led to an extension. For much of the summer, it was
one of Broadway's highest-grossing shows, often operating at more
than 90 percent capacity, and pulling in grosses of more than
$550,000 a week as tourists and die-hard fans flocked back.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1982, the Winter Garden, one of
Broadway's most visible theaters, will be dark. One of the few
theaters actually located on Broadway, Winter Garden has a giant
marquee that until now has sported the show's ubiquitous logo - a
pair of yellow cats' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A new tenant already has been booked and theater people think it
could be the next blockbuster. After an extensive renovation and
restoration, the Winter Garden will reopen with another London
success: ''Mamma Mia!'' - a musical built around ABBA's greatest
hits. Yet don't plan on seeing it anytime soon. Opening night for
''Mamma Mia!'': Oct. 18, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Scientist OKs Plea Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, who
was fired and jailed on charges of mishandling nuclear weapons
secrets, has agreed to plead guilty to one charge and will
cooperate with federal investigators, Justice Department sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is expected to be released after a hearing Monday and be
sentenced to time already served, ending a 3-year-old case that has
been marked by allegations of espionage and racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations began as an offshoot of a Chinese espionage case
with dire accusations that Lee had downloaded the ''crown jewels''
of American science, might be poised to hand them over to a foreign
power and might even be spirited away by spies in helicopters. The
government ultimately backed down from nearly all those charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee and his family are thrilled at the prospect that he
may be released unconditionally tomorrow,'' defense attorney Mark
Holscher said Sunday, adding that he cannot elaborate on terms of
the settlement because they have not yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Lee very much wants to go home to his family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a key turning point in the two months of plea discussions was Lee's
agreement to explain what happened to seven computer tapes, onto
which he was accused of downloading sensitive information. Lee has
said the tapes were destroyed, now he will better explain how, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The location and fate of the tapes were always of paramount
concern,'' one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Lee will plead guilty to one of the 59 counts
against him of unlawful gathering of national defense information.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also will agree to hold himself completely available for
federal investigators and cooperate with them over the next six
months, the sources said, and it was expected that Lee would drop
his allegations that prosecutors went after him because he is
Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker announced that a plea agreement
had been reached in a brief order Sunday. A Monday appeals court
hearing in Denver on Lee's bail, which Parker had approved, was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, was accused of downloading restricted material about
nuclear weapons to unsecured computers and tapes while working at
Los Alamos National Laboratory. His trial had been set for Nov. 6,
and he could have faced life in prison if convicted on all 59
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been jailed since his arrest Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Parker signed a release order for Lee to be freed on $1 million
bail last month before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
stayed his order. Parker had set strict conditions for his release,
including electronic monitoring, restrictions on travel and limits
on the number of people with whom Lee could communicate. It was not
immediately known if those conditions would still be enforced under
the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said releasing Lee would be a risk because he
could pass on the tapes or communicate their contents to foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientific groups have protested the conditions of the
Taiwan-born Lee's arrest, saying he has been the target of ethnic
and racial profiling by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an astonishing development and an amazing retreat by the
government,'' said Steve Aftergood, who directs the Project on
Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists in
Washington, D.C. ''They had evidently decided he was not working in
the interest of a foreign power or to the detriment of the United
States. It's only regrettable that conclusion was not reached many
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White Rock neighborhood where Lee lives, his neighbors
Don and Jean Marshall said they were planning a party to welcome
him home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to have people here, line the street. We have a
bunch of flags for people to wave'' to show that neighbors believe
in the justice system, Don Marshall said.

<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (9-5), the fifth pitcher in a pitching relay
after scheduled starter Matt Wise skipped his turn with an elbow
problem, went 1 1-3 innings for the victory. Troy Percival pitched
a perfect ninth for his 28th save in 37 chances.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1, Bengie Molina led off the seventh
inning with a double and scored when Kennedy sliced a single to
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine went four innings in a rare start, and Mike Fyhrie,
Mark Petkovsek, Mike Holtz, Hasegawa and Percival finished the job.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effort of the Angels bullpen dramatized the
plight of Mussina (9-14), who entered the game ranked last in
offensive support among AL starters with 3.69 runs per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina allowed five hits and three walks, striking out six, in
his sixth complete game of season.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad led off the fourth with the Angels' first hit,
moved up on a walk to Scott Spiezio and scored as Mo Vaughn singled
for his 108th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore finally broke through in the seventh, as Eugene
Kingsale's infield grounder scored Mark Lewis to tie it at 1-all.
</P>
<P>
   Levine blanked the Orioles through four innings in only the
third start of his career in 169 games. Levine stepped in when
elbow fatigue shelved Wise and allowed four hits, with two walks
and three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wise is expected to take his next turn, pending the results
of an MRI on his elbow. ... The Orioles are 4-5 on their longest
road trip in four years, since a matching 13-game tour in 1996. ...
The four innings raised Levine's season total to 85, matching his
single-season high. ... Mussina's three walks matched his total for
his previous 37 2-3 innings.

   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Darron Stiles won the Buy.com Tour's
Tri-Cities Open on Sunday, closing with a 1-over-par 73 in rainy
conditions for a two-stroke victory over John Kernohan.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles, who earned $72,000, had a 6-under 282 total on the
Meadow Springs course. He also won the 1999 Dominion Open, holing a
125-yard shot for an eagle on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not as exciting as the first,'' the former Florida
Southern star said. ''But I think in a way that it was more
nerve-wracking just because of the conditions that the golf course
was playing -- how hard it was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kernohan had a 71. Ty Armstrong shot a 67, the best round of the
day, to finished third at 285.

<HEADLINE> Sneh Blames Violence on Settlers  </HEADLINE>
By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- A top aide to Prime Minister Ehud Barak
blamed Jewish settlers Sunday for escalating violence in the
divided West Bank city of Hebron and said their behavior could
jeopardize their presence in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen in the city of 130,000 Palestinians and 400
settlers since reports emerged in July that Israel was prepared to
remove the settlers from the heart of the city as part of a final
peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli girl's accusation on July 15 that a Palestinian
sexually assaulted her, and a hit-and-run accident last month
involving a Palestinian driver and an Israeli youth sparked angry
rampages by the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, what I learned is that actually certain people
in the Israeli community are the ones who have been recently
increasing the number of violent acts,'' Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said while touring the Israeli-controlled center of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh, who met with Israeli military officials, said he supported
a continued Jewish presence in the city holy to both Muslims and
Jews -- but he believed that settler behavior placed such a future
in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The provocations are putting a question mark on that future,
and that is, of course, very regrettable,'' Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh is close to Barak. The prime minister has denied reports
that he agreed to uproot the Jewish presence in Hebron in his
negotiations with the Palestinians at the U.S. sponsored Camp David
summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers refused to meet with Sneh. Settler spokesman Noam
Arnon, the father of the 14-year-old girl who said she was
attacked, accused Sneh of slander.
</P>
<P>
   ''He stands next to our homes and continues to speak lies and of
destruction and, in his crooked way, slander citizens and the
Jewish community that is living here in tough conditions,'' Arnon
told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged assault and other incidents prompted settlers to
knock over stalls in the Arab vegetable market and attack
Palestinian passersby. Israeli troops were forced to separate the
sides.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 Muslims as they
worshipped at the Cave of the Patriarchs, believed by Jews and
Muslims to be the tomb of the biblical forefathers. The virulently
anti-Israeli Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has a large
following in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis moved into Hebron in 1967 after Israel captured the
West Bank in the Mideast war. Israel handed much of Hebron to
Palestinian control in 1997, but still administers the quarter in
the center of the city where the Jews and about 30,000 Arabs live.

<HEADLINE> Protests Cancel Basketball Practice  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic men's basketball
team canceled practice Monday (Sunday night EDT) as thousands of
protesters surrounded their hotel in demonstrations against the
World Economic Forum held at the same site.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's team, however, chose to walk through the crowds
to get to their bus. They held a two-hour practice after being
delayed for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the men are more recognizable, we didn't want to take
any chances,'' said Craig Miller, a spokesman for USA Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mostly young, colorfully dressed protesters
surrounded the Crown Casino and Hotel on the first day of the
economic forum, a meeting of top business leaders from around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Police set up concrete barricades and fences around the
perimeter of the hotel, a sprawling complex with dozens of
restaurants, theaters and shops. The protesters, vowing disrupt the
meeting, massed around the entire circumference of the hotel and
kept traffic from entering or leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team met in the lobby at 8:30 a.m. and waited while
team officials, hotel personnel and police decided how to get them
out of the building so they could make the one-mile trip to their
practice facility at Melbourne Park.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the women simply walked through an opening in the
barricades and strolled a quarter-mile to their bus. The protesters
left them alone, except for directing a playful chant of ''Aussie,
Aussie, Aussie. Oy, Oy, Oy,'' at them, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was easier than I thought it would be,'' U.S. player
Theresa Edwards said. ''They were sitting on the ground. It wasn't
like they were standing there with sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials suggested that the men's team leave the hotel by
boat and travel to the arena by way of the Yarra River, which runs
alongside the hotel complex. Team officials nixed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were able to lift weights, run and walk through some
plays inside the hotel,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for getting the team to practice on Tuesday were not yet
certain. The economic meeting is scheduled to last three days, and
protesters plan to stick around and continue disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders spoke via walkie-talkie and directed their
followers to points around the perimeter where they thought buses
might try to enter or leave.
</P>
<P>
   They used chalk and spray paint to write anti-capitalist
messages on the outside of the concrete barricades -- political
statements such as ''This building is a temple of greed'' and
lighthearted messages such as ''The police look bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding anti-capitalist placards and banners, one group staged a
sitdown near one vehicle entrance and chanted ''Hey, Nike, you so
bad. You so bad you make me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers were called in from surrounding precincts and suburbs,
making the hotel complex look like an armed camp. The casino stayed
open Sunday night as the police barricades were already in place,
and patrons entering through the only available entrance scanned
with hand-held metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball officials had been warned months ago that they
could become victims of the protests, but they decided to stick
with their choice of accommodations
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess this is the price you pay for staying in the kind of
hotel we're in,'' Sheryl Swoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team plans to leave for Sydney on Wednesday, while
the men will leave a day later.

<HEADLINE> Parents Brawl at Boys Soccer Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- A tied soccer game between 8- and
9-year-old boys ended in a brawl among their parents Sunday after a
disagreement over where a coach was standing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A shootout was to take place between the teams -- one from Staten
Island, N.Y., and the other from North Hunterdon -- but before it
could, a Staten Island coach argued that a North Hunterdon coach
shouldn't be allowed to stand behind the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The argument escalated into a fistfight with as many as a dozen
parents and coaches involved. No children were involved, South
Brunswick police Officer Jim Ryan said. Even after police arrived,
parents were still yelling at each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said a coach and a parent claimed to have been assaulted,
but no one was seriously injured or arrested, police said. Both
teams were escorted from the field, and neither was declared the
game winner, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was just the latest case of parental rage at youth
sporting events this year. In August, a hockey dad was indicted on
manslaughter charges in the beating death of another father at a
game in Massachusetts, and a baseball coach was accused of breaking
an umpire's jaw after a disputed call in Florida in June.

<HEADLINE> 'The West Wing' Wins 8 Emmy Awards  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a landslide any politician would envy,
NBC's idealistic series about a White House staff in turmoil, ''The
West Wing,'' won a record-tying eight Emmy awards Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini, the hulking mob boss on HBO's ''The
Sopranos,'' ended the dry spell for his show, which was nominated
for 18 awards, by winning the best actor trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't really explain this, except the academy maybe has an
affinity for slightly overweight bald men,'' Gandolfini said.
</P>
<P>
   The haul for ''The West Wing'' tied the previous record of eight
Emmys for a series in its first season held by ''ER'' and ''Hill
Street Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be no living with me now,'' said series
creator Aaron Sorkin, who won an Emmy for his writing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox was a sentimental winner of the best actor award
for a comedy. Fox retired from his comedy about a New York City
mayoral office, ''Spin City,'' after this season because of
Parkinson's disease. He won three best actor trophies in a row in
the 1980s for ''Family Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks. It's been a great ride and stay tuned,'' Fox said,
after receiving a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Heaton, who plays the long-suffering wife of comedian
Ray Romano on the CBS comedy, ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' won best
actress in a comedy. It was her first award.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actor Jack Lemmon, a Hollywood favorite, drew a standing
ovation won he won best actor in a miniseries or movie for ''Oprah
Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie.'' His co-star, Hank Azaria,
also won an Emmy, and the show was honored as best TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''A little bit of magic,'' said Lemmon, fighting back tears as
he paid tribute to his family: ''This, what I do, is important. But
you are my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward was an upset winner in the best actress category in a
drama for ABC's ''Once and Again.'' She beat out two competing
characters from ''The Sopranos,'' Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-show buzz was about the faceoff between ''The West
Wing'' and ''The Sopranos,'' the politicians against the mobsters.
Both had 18 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schiff, who plays the grim aide Toby Ziegler, and
Allison Janney, who portrays the White House's tough press
secretary, won supporting actor awards. Series creator Aaron Sorkin
won for writing, and Thomas Schlamme for directing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love every member of my cast,'' Janney said. ''This should
be an ensemble award and I share it with all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Janney paid tribute to fellow nominee Nancy Marchand, who played
the scheming matriarch Livia Soprano in the HBO series. Marchand
died of lung cancer on June 18. Janney called Marchand ''exquisite,
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, David Letterman's ''Late Show'' won
the award for best variety series. It came during a year Letterman
had to take a break for an emergency quintuple bypass operation in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dave, if you're watching at home, it looks like the fake heart
surgery paid off,'' said the show's executive producer, Rob
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's series about a Baltimore inner-city neighborhood, ''The
Corner,'' won three Emmys, including outstanding miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Izzard won for both his performance and writing in his HBO
special, ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Two relatively new comedies, NBC's ''Will &AMP; Grace'' and Fox's
''Malcolm in the Middle,'' were award winners.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally of ''Will &AMP; Grace'' won best
supporting actor and actress. For both of them, it was their first
Emmy and gave the comedy bragging rights as it moves to a
high-profile slot on NBC's Thursday lineup this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Holland was saluted for directing ''Malcolm in the
Middle,'' and the show's writers also won Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's series about a Baltimore inner-city neighborhood, ''The
Corner,'' won three Emmys, including outstanding miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Izzard won for both his performance and writing in his HBO
special, ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest television events of the past year -- ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' -- weren't competing Sunday.
''Millionaire'' was shunted off to the Daytime Emmys and
''Survivor'' missed the cutoff for nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Host Garry Shandling did a ''Survivor'' takeoff in his opening
segment, though, and several contestants were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest,''
Shandling said. ''I think real people should not be on television.
It's for special people like us, people who have trained and
studied to appear to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy watchers were anxious to see the impact of a change in
voting procedures designed to widen the voting panel and make it
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of requiring Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
members to watch nominated shows in a hotel, the academy sent out
videotapes for voters to watch at home. As a result, it nearly
quadrupled the number of people voting.
</P>
<P>
   Many actors, including John Lithgow and David Schwimmer, wore
gold ribbons in a show of support for the Screen Actors Guild and
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, who are
involved in a strike against the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   Among networks, NBC was the leading nominee with 95 bids. It was
followed by HBO with 86, ABC with 65, CBS with 42 and Fox with 26.

<HEADLINE> Quake Rattles Islands Off Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake rattled a string of volcanic
islands off Tokyo on Monday, but with no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.2, was centered
near the Izu islands chain, reaching from about six miles under the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was most strongly felt on Toshima, about 90 miles
south of Tokyo, and Shikinejima, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries, local police said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, more moderate tremors continued to shake the
islands, including a 4.2-magnitude temblor.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mount Oyama, which stands 2,670-feet tall on the island of
Miyakejima, began volcanic activity June 26, the Izu islands area
have been hit with some 13,800 earthquakes that were strong enough
to be felt by humans. On July 1, a magnitude 6.4 tremor killed a
man, who was buried in a landslide, on Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only officials and relief workers remain on Miyakejima
after all of the island's 3,855 residents have fled to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have said shifts in huge underground pools of magma are
responsible for the recent volcanic and seismic activity on
Miyakejima.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Thousands of Chileans marched in a downpour Sunday to
recall the 27th anniversary of the bloody coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
demanding the former dictator be brought to trial. Amid a heavy police presence,
demonstrators walked 2&AMP;frac12; miles from downtown Santiago to the cemetery
where Salvador Allende, the Marxist president who committed suicide during the
coup against him, lies buried. Cold and a steady rain did not dampen the spirits
of the leftists, human rights activists and families of those who died during

<HEADLINE> No contract, but teachers and students back to school in Buffalo  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Teachers still don't have a contract but
they and the city's 47,000 students will be back in the classroom
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With the promise of intensive negotiations, teachers and
district officials announced late Sunday that school would resume,
suspending a strike that canceled classes and activities for two
days last week.
</P>
<P>
   At an 11 p.m. press conference, Philip Rumore, president of the
Buffalo Teachers Federation, said his union had agreed to a
recommendation by a state labor mediator to return to classes as
talks continued. He said the teachers would conduct informational
picketing before school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides are working very hard and we haven't reached a
settlement yet,'' Rumore said. ''I can't give any predictions as to
how long it will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rumore nor Board of Education president Paul Buchanan
would characterize the tenor of the talks. The two sides met for 20
hours over the weekend to try to reach agreement on a deal that
would give the city's 3,800 teachers a contract for the first time
since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At a 10:30 p.m. press conference, district Superintendent Marion
Canedo directed students to return to class Monday, saying: ''We're
working very hard, all of us, to make progress.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending classes the first day of school last week,
teachers shocked the district, students and parents by announcing
the work stoppage one hour before classes on Thursday. Without
warning, parents had to scramble for child care and in a few
instances children had no supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, with no deal in sight, Canedo told students to
stay home Friday. Teachers headed back to the classroom Friday as a
''sign of good will,'' and spent the day cleaning classrooms and
developing lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have said they would not bend on their demand for pay
raises of 3.5 percent in four out of five years. The district's
latest offer, reported Friday, contained across-the-board yearly
raises of 2 percent in three out of four years.
</P>
<P>
   The strike violates the state's Taylor Law which prohibits
public employees from striking. Teachers could face fines of two
days' pay for every day off the job.
</P>
<P>
   The union also face additional penalties for violating an order
issued Wednesday by state Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dillon
barring the union and four of its officers from engaging in a
strike or other illegal job actions.

<HEADLINE> 'West Wing,''Morrie' Win at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a landslide any politician would envy,
NBC's idealistic series about a White House staff in turmoil, ''The
West Wing,'' won a record-setting nine Emmy awards Sunday night
including best drama series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rubout in the political drama's competition with HBO's
''The Sopranos.'' James Gandolfini, who plays ''The Sopranos'''
hulking mob boss, avoided a shutout for his show by winning best
actor.
</P>
<P>
   The haul for ''The West Wing'' broke the previous record of
eight Emmys for a series in a single season, set by ''ER'' and
''Hill Street Blues'' in their first years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be no living with me now,'' said ''West
Wing'' creator Aaron Sorkin, who won an Emmy for his writing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox was a sentimental winner of the best actor award
for a comedy. Fox retired from his comedy about a New York City
mayoral office, ''Spin City,'' after last season because of
Parkinson's disease. He won three best actor trophies in a row in
the 1980s for ''Family Ties.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks. It's been a great ride and stay tuned,'' Fox said,
after receiving a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will &AMP; Grace'' won best comedy show, a big boost for NBC's
sitcom as it moves to Thursday nights this fall. It also won two
awards for its supporting actors, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Heaton, who plays the long-suffering wife of comedian
Ray Romano on the CBS comedy ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' won best
actress in a comedy. It was her first award.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actor Jack Lemmon, a Hollywood favorite, drew a standing
ovation when he won best actor in a miniseries or movie for ''Oprah
Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie.'' His co-star, Hank Azaria,
also won an Emmy, and the show was honored as best TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''A little bit of magic,'' said Lemmon, fighting back tears as
he paid tribute to his family: ''This and what I do, is important.
But you are my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward was an upset winner in the best actress category in a
drama for ABC's ''Once and Again.'' She beat out two competing
actresses from ''The Sopranos,'' Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini, in taking home the only trophy for HBO's
groundbreaking series, said, ''I can't really explain this, except
the academy maybe has an affinity for slightly overweight bald
men.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-show buzz was about the faceoff between ''The West
Wing'' and ''The Sopranos,'' the politicians against the mobsters.
Both had 18 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The West Wing'' won in a walk. Richard Schiff, who plays the
grim aide Toby Ziegler, and Allison Janney, who portrays the White
House's tough press secretary, won supporting actor awards. Thomas
Schlamme won for directing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love every member of my cast,'' Janney said. ''This should
be an ensemble award and I share it with all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Janney paid tribute to fellow nominee Nancy Marchand, who played
the scheming matriarch Livia Soprano. Marchand died of lung cancer
on June 18. Janney called Marchand ''exquisite, elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC won bragging rights with 23 Emmys. HBO had 20 awards, ABC
had 15, Fox had 11 and CBS had 7.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, David Letterman's ''Late Show'' won
the award for best variety series. It came during a year Letterman
had to take a break for an emergency quintuple bypass operation in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dave, if you're watching at home, it looks like the fake heart
surgery paid off,'' said the show's executive producer, Rob
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's series about a Baltimore inner-city neighborhood, ''The
Corner,'' won three Emmys, including outstanding miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Izzard won for both his performance and writing in his HBO
special, ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest television events of the past year -- ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' -- weren't competing Sunday.
''Millionaire'' was shunted off to the Daytime Emmys and
''Survivor'' missed the cutoff for nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Host Garry Shandling did a ''Survivor'' takeoff in his opening
segment, though, and several contestants were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest,''
Shandling said. ''I think real people should not be on television.
It's for special people like us, people who have trained and
studied to appear to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmy watchers were anxious to see the impact of a change in
voting procedures designed to widen the voting panel and make it
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of requiring Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
members to watch nominated shows in a hotel, the academy sent out
videotapes for voters to watch at home. As a result, it nearly
quadrupled the number of people voting.
</P>
<P>
   Many actors, including John Lithgow and David Schwimmer, wore
gold ribbons in a show of support for the Screen Actors Guild and
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, who are
involved in a strike against the advertising industry.

<HEADLINE> Unions Urge Strike Support at Emmys  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jack Lemmon wore one. So did Martin Sheen,
Kelsey Grammer, Peter Boyle and ''Friends'' stars Matthew Perry and
David Schwimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name performers showed support for their often-anonymous
brethren in the commercial actors strike by donning yellow ribbons
at the Emmy Awards on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston wore a ribbon, though her new husband, Brad
Pitt, did not. Michael J. Fox showed up without a ribbon, but
picked one up midway through the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists began a walkout May 1 against the advertising
industry. In early August it became the longest strike in Hollywood
history.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA want to protect residuals, fees paid each time a
radio or television commercial is broadcast on a major network.
Advertisers want to replace residuals with flat-fee payments.
</P>
<P>
   The issue ignited passion in many actors backstage at the Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the athletes and politicians who do commercials, and
are scabs ... should all be kicked in their respective
you-know-whats,'' said Charles S. Dutton, who won an Emmy for
directing the HBO movie ''The Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schiff, who won a supporting actor award for playing a
taciturn presidential aide on NBC's ''The West Wing,'' cheered the
commercial actors. Advertisers were being ''sad and greedy,'' he
said, in the face of unparalleled prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strike is going to be important. It's a precursor to a
long and painful strike,'' Schiff said, referring to potential
walkouts by all actors and writers during contract talks next year.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show occurred three days before negotiators for the
unions and the ad industry plan to meet in New York.
