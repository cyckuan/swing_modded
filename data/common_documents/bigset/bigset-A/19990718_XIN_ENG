<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday protested to the
Arab League against the continued violations of its airspace by
warplanes of the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a protest message sent to Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Iraqi permanent delegate to the league Sultan
Shavi said the warplanes of the two countries carried out 288
sorties in the first week of July.
</P>
<P>
Shavi demanded Abdel-Meguid to intervene to halt the aggressive
actions that threaten Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integration.
</P>
<P>
The actions by the two western allies panic civilians and
damage property, he said.
</P>
<P>
The airstrikes also constitute a flagrant violation of the Arab
League Charter, the joint Arab defense pact, the United Nations
Charter and the international laws, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat underlined his country's right to demand
compensation for material and moral damage.
</P>
<P>
Since December, warplanes of the U.S. and Britain have been
patroling the two no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq,
which were set up after the 1991 Gulf War. The warplanes have
attacked Iraq's military and civilian targets, leaving scores of
people dead and properties damaged.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Senior Officials to Attend "Six Plus Two" Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Taliban senior official
responsible for the foreign affairs Mulla Mohammad Hasan will lead
a delegation in the forthcoming meeting of the "Six Plus Two"
group in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, informed sources here
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also include Taliban top information
official Ameer Khan Muttaqi, said the Pakistani sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Pakistan envoy on Afghanistan Iftikhar Murshid has
left for Uzbekistan to attend the "Six Plus Two" meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had earlier put the condition that it would attend
the meeting, which is scheduled on July 19-20 to discuss ways for
the peaceful settlement of the Afghan turmoil, only if invited as
the Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary General for
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi Saturday sought Pakistan's help to
persuade the Taliban to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy, when meeting with Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz here, said it will be in the interest of the Taliban,
since they control the major portion of Afghanistan's territory,
to attend the meeting and express their position, according to a
Pakistani Foreign Office statement.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here from London early Saturday on his way to
Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
The "Six Plus Two" group comprises Afghanistan's six immediate
neighbors including Pakistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and China plus the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Pakistan is the only country which recognizes the
Taliban as a government.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Says Treason Case to Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour said Saturday the judiciary is the sole competent authority
to determine the fate of the treason case facing 18 opposition
Civic United Front (CUF) members who have been detained since
late 1997.  Opening a two-day youth meeting in Zanzibar, Amour
said he has no mandate to dictate terms on the matter that is
being handled by the court.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of the National Executive Committee of the youth
 organization Vijana of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), he
urged people to wait before the court decides whether to convict
the suspects or set them free for whatever suitable reasons it
deems fit.  Amour pointed out that under the current system and
separation of powers, it is not wise to interfere with the work
of the judiciary by ordering the release of the accused persons,
reports from Zanzibar said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us give the judiciary a chance to accomplish its
proceedings and decide the way it sees fit," Amour told the
gathering which among other things will discuss the political
situation and the crusade against corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar President said that the rule of law must be given a
chance to ensure that all the people become law abiding citizens.
He said this is a prerequisite and guarantee for national
stability and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The accused persons in the treason case include four members of
the Zanzibar House of Representatives. They are charged with
plotting to overthrow the isles government and remove President
Amour from power.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under Amour who was seeking a second term as
president of the isles, claimed a narrow victory over the CUF in
the 1995 elections, but CUF questioned the result and locked
horns with CCM in a series of conflicts during the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the Commonwealth, the two political parties last
month signed a landmark national reconciliation agreement to
settle the political impasse in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's twin islands joined Tanganyika in 1964 to form the
United Republic of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Unionist Leader Trimble Hints to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble Saturday given the strongest of indications that he will
not stand down as Northern Ireland First Minister.
</P>
<P>
In an interview for a BBC Radio program, Trimble said that
despite the resignation of Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon,
for him to do the same could send a signal that the political
process was disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party
(SDLP), resigned Thursday after the failed attempt to set up a
power-sharing assembly under the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It had been expected that Trimble might step down as first
minister after Seamus Mallon's resignation, but the Ulster
Unionist leader said that the British and Irish Governments were
privately briefing journalists that he should stay.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said the events of the past week had proved his party
was not bluffing about decommissioning and that he was not
interested in a fudge.
</P>
<P>
"If I were to resign would that not make it appear that the
position is crumbling further, that the process is disintegrating
further," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although it is likely that former U.S. Senator George Mitchell,
who brokered last year's Good Friday Agreement, will be asked to
chair the next attempt to solve the decommissioning dispute,
Trimble said the parties would have to solve it themselves.
</P>
<P>
Northern Irish police Saturday charged four men after finding
an arms cache, underlining the daunting task facing George
Mitchell as he tries again to bring peace to the British province.

with visiting Venezuelan Deputy Foreign Minister Khorkhi Valero
Pristivio.
</P>
<P>
Saudi News Agency (SNA) said the two sides discussed ways of

Arabia and Venezuela in particular.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the SNA, al-N'aimi stressed the oil cooperation
between the two members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, also two of the world's leading oil producers and
exporters.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the recent improvement in oil prices in
world markets was the result of the co-ordination among
oil-producing countries including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Journalist, Professor Fined for Libeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday fined
a journalist and a professor 10,000 Egyptians pounds (2,945 U.S.
dollars) each for libeling a prominent Sunni cleric in a newspaper
article that accused him of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Criminal Court also ordered the two men to pay 501
pounds (147 dollars) each as temporary compensation to Mohammed
Sayyed Tantawi, the grand sheik of Al-Azhar University in Cairo,
the world's best-known university for Sunni Islamic studies,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The journalist, Mustafa Noureddin, was taken to court by the
government prosecutor for writing an article in the opposition
Al-Ahrar daily, in which he alleged that Tantawi was corrupt, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yehia Ismail Halboush, a professor at Al-Azhar who opposed
Tantawi, was convicted of providing the information for the
article last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Ismail was one of the members of the Al-Azhar Ulama Front,
which brought together militant clergymen into Al-Azhar to oppose
the more moderate Tantawi. The government banned the front in June
last year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi, Myanmar Officials Hold "Cordial" Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi and Myanmar foreign
ministers held "cordial" talks here on Saturday on the entire
gamut of bilateral relations, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering formation of a (joint) commission to
resolve some issues between us" and to promote all-round
cooperation between the two neighbors, Azad told reporters after
official talks with his Myanmar counterpart, U Win Aung, at the
Meghna State Guest House this evening.
</P>
<P>
Terming the two-hour talks as "fruitful," Azad said the talks,
covering such issues as repatriation of Rohingya refugees staying
in Bangladesh, land mining and border trade, were held in a
"cordial" atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar foreign minister, who arrived here earlier Saturday
on a three-day official visit to Bangladesh after concluding his
visit to Sri Lanka, said the two sides expressed their will to
resolve the issues existing between them.
</P>
<P>
The proposed commission would be formed considering different
tires to take up various issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers needed to have more meetings and there should
be more exchange of visits between the two countries at different
levels to resolve various issues, Aung said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that senior official-level meeting, which
remained stalled for more than two years, would be resumed. The
last and 21st round of senior official-level meeting between the
two sides was held in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Aung said the refugee issue would be
solved, but he gave no time-frame. Over 20,000 Myanmar refugees,
known here as Rohingya refugees, are living in two camps in Cox's
Bazar, southeast Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas crossed Bangladesh border in 1991, and
about 230,000 of them have been repatriated under a memorandum of
understanding between Bangladesh and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar stopped in July
1997 reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to return.
</P>
<P>
The official BSS news agency said that since the repatriation
was resumed in November last year and up to June this year, only
378 Rohingyas had been repatriated, and during this period, 621
babies were born in the camps and 78 died, leaving an additional
543 to be included in the total number of refugees awaiting
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the two foreign ministers would meet again on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aung is scheduled to call on President Shahabuddin Ahmed and
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebels Hand Over 192 Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) of Sierra Leone has handed over 192 abducted children to the
United Nations special representative in the country, said reports
reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The group of children and a few adults were brought to capital
Freetown in two trucks from Magbeni, about 60 kilometers east of
the capital and was formally received by U.N. Special
Representative Francis Okello and West African peace-keeping force
of ECOMOG Commander Major Gen. Felix Mujakpero.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued by the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF), many of the children are poorly clad, visibly tired,
undernourished and complained of hunger and thirst.
</P>
<P>
The release added that most of the 68 females were between the
ages of 14 and 20, and at least a quarter of them were pregnant
with seven lactating adolescent mothers.
</P>
<P>
The rebels who signed a peace agreement on July 7 with the
Sierra Leonean government have been accused of killing, mutilating
and raping civilians.
</P>
<P>
The rebel RUF has freed about 1,000 of the estimated 3,000
children they are believed to be holding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of former rebels have been streaming into
capital Freetown since last Wednesday from the bush following the
peace agreement signed in Togolese capital of Lome.
</P>
<P>
The influx of the unarmed rebels has prompted fear among
Freetown residents who expressed concern that the rebels were
entering the city before the start of planned disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, the rebels are supposed to go to
U.N.- monitored disarmament centers to be set up by the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah who signed the
agreement with rebel leader Foday Sankoh was also concerned about
the rebel influx.

<HEADLINE> Search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s Plane Goes on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Coast Guard and the Air
National Guard are conducting a massive search off the coast of
Long Island, N.Y. for a small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr.,
son of the 35th U.S. President, U.S. media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The search began Saturday morning in an area covering some
1,000 square miles, presumably the flight path of Kennedy's plane,
searchers said.
</P>
<P>
The plane carrying also Kennedy's wife and his sister-in-law
reportedly took off from Caldwell, N.J. at 8:40 pm Friday and was
due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, Mass.. a little more than one
hour later, but it did not.
</P>
<P>
The first report about the missing of the single-engine plane
came from members of Kennedy family, airport sources said.
</P>
<P>
John F.Kennedy Jr., 38 and living in New York, is the founder
of George magazine. Before going to publishing, he was an
assistant district attorney in Manhattan of New York.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expert: Emerging Water Shortages Threaten Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Spreading water shortages
threaten to reduce the global food supply by more than 10 percent
and could lead to hunger, civil unrest, and even wars over waters,
a U.S. Worldwatch Institute researcher said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Without increasing water productivity in irrigation, major
food-producing regions will not have enough water to sustain crop
production," said Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water
Policy Project in Amherst, Massachusetts State, and a senior
fellow at the Worldwatch Institute based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation accounts for two thirds of global water use, but
less than half that water reaches the roots of plants, Postel said
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Some 40 percent of the world's food comes from irrigated
cropland," Postel said, "and we're betting on that share to
increase to feed a growing population." But the productivity of
irrigation is in jeopardy from the overpumping of groundwater, the
growing diversion of irrigation water to cities, and the buildup
of salts in the soil, she added.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation problems are widespread in the grain-growing regions
today, and water tables are dropping steadily in several major
food-producing regions as groundwater is pumped faster than nature
replenishes it, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
The world's farmers are racking up an annual water deficit of
some 160 billion cubic meters -- the amount used to produce nearly
10 percent of the world's grain, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Postel said the overpumping of groundwater cannot continue
indefinitely, and eventually the wells run dry, or it becomes too
expensive to pump from greater depths.
</P>
<P>
With population growing rapidly in many of the most water-short
regions, water problems are bound to worsen, she said. "The number
of people living in water-stressed countries is projected to climb
from 470 million to 3 billion by 2025. Already many countries do
not have enough water to meet domestic demands for food, creating
a source of potential political instability."
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenges of a water-short world, Postel proposed
a "Blue Revolution" to dramatically boost water productivity.
"Most farmers today irrigate the way their predecessors did
hundreds of years ago," Postel said. "Just as raising land
productivity helped meet food needs during the last half of this
century, boosting water productivity will be the agricultural
frontier during the next century. The challenge today is to
substitute technology and better management for water," she added.

<HEADLINE> John F. Kennedy Plane Reported Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A small plane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr., son of the former U.S. president, was reported
missing early Saturday, and a search was under way off the coast
of New York's Long Island, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The plane left an airfield in New Jersey State at 8:45 p.m.(
local time) Friday and was believed to be carrying Kennedy and his
wife Carolyn Bessette to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State,
where the Kennedy family was gathering for a wedding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed it was searching for the plane
with help from the Air National Guard. The search was being
conducted in water off eastern tip of Long Island, along the
presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Gaspar, an operations specialist at Martha's Vineyard
Airport, said Kennedy's plane was supposed to arrive Friday night,
but never did.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little worried, because I know him personally," Gaspar
said.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Martin, who described himself as a friend of the family,
said he was told Kennedy was headed for Martha's Vineyard and was
then to go to the wedding of a cousin, Rory, daughter of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement from the office of U.S.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the couple was to be married Saturday
before 275 guests in a private ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy family contacted the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) when the plane was overdue, and the agency
began checking airports along the route, a source said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard and Air National Guard then started a search.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of the 35th president,
and was born just two months before his father's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
His father's assassination immediately thrust him into the
public eye with the poignant photo of the little boy saluting as
his funeral procession passed.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics.
After graduating from Brown University, he went to law school and
joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.

<HEADLINE> India Threatens to Kill Intruders Within LOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- India declared Saturday that
intruders found on its side of the so-called Line of Control (LOC)
would be "shot and killed" as the extended deadline for withdrawal
of infiltrators ended this morning.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline for withdrawal has expired this morning and,
therefore, any Pakistan Army soldier or activity observed on our
side of the LOC will be treated as hostile and targeted
accordingly," an Indian army spokesman told the press here.
</P>
<P>
"While our troops are fully geared to neutralize any enemy
remnants, no enemy activity has been reported by our ground troops
in any of the sectors since this morning," he admitted at a
special briefing.
</P>
<P>
India Friday agreed to extend by 24 hours the deadline for
pull-out of what New Delhi termed as intruders from Pakistan,
which was originally set on the first light of July 16 by the
directors general of military operations (DGMOs) of India and
Pakistan last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), DGMOs of the two
countries talked to each other yesterday on the hotline to discuss
the issue of withdrawal. Details of the conversation were not
known.
</P>
<P>
While Indian troops had reached the LOC in Batalik, Kaksar and
Drass areas of Kashmir, the spokesman said, they were moving
forward for occupying heights along the LOC in Mushkoh sector.
</P>
<P>
Following the expiry of the deadline, the spokesman added, any
intruder found within Indian territory "would be shot and killed".
</P>
<P>
Since the breakout of the current conflict in Kashmir,
according of official figures published by India, Pakistan forces
suffered 698 fatalities while 410 Indian soldiers, including 25
officers, were killed with 593 others wounded and four missing.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for us not to give the correct (casualty)
figures," the spokesman said, adding that "we have obligations to
keep the family members of every armed forces personnel informed
about their fate".

<HEADLINE> Behind Lee Teng-hui's Farce Of Division (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A signed article released by
Xinhua today said that persons in power in Taiwan have recently
staged a farce in trying to divide the motherland, with Lee Teng-
hui as its hero.
</P>
<P>
Lee on July 9 redefined the cross-Straits relations as "state-
to-state or at least special state-to-state relations".
</P>
<P>
Some people, encouraged by Lee's remarks, have picked up on
this and been clamoring about the remarks on "two states", the
article says. According to some who worked for Lee, he encouraged
his aides and staff members a year ago to form a special group to
make a "breakthrough" in the "one China" principle and to redefine
the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The redefinition of the cross-Straits relations appeared after
a year of planning, when Lee, interviewed by a German radio
station, made it public. The article says, he took this
opportunity, because he wanted to remind people of the two
Germanys and to seek a "new legal framework" for the cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
In a book he wrote, the legal framework is explained by saying
that the cross-Straits relations are no longer a domestic matter,
but one between two equal political entities with separate rulers.
Then, he said that when the "one China" principle is accepted by
the international community, Taiwan has to claim itself to be a "
state" so as to safeguard the legal status of the "Republic of
China" in the world.
</P>
<P>
After Lee's "state-to-state" remarks, the Taiwan authorities
got busy making changes in certain laws.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Make Better Use of Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is beefing up effort
to make better use of water resources throughout the country,
Ethiopian News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has approved a water policy deemed to
promote the sustainable utilization of water sources of the
country, Water Resources Minister Shiferaw Jarsso was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Regional states would translate the national water policy into
action based on their objective local realities, he said.
</P>
<P>
On reason to implement the new water resources strategy,
Shiferaw said that the various water projects undertaken in
Ethiopia over the last 40 years had not produced the desired
result.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the potable and irrigation projects carried out
over the last four decades had not been able to effectively
respond to the basic needs of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, less than 10 percent of the water
projects undertaken to date are functional. "The remaining have
gone out of service largely due to lack of maintenance services
and facilities."

The Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits saw Lee'
s nature more clearly as he made an uproar with his "two states"
redefinition and have become indignant about his separatist
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Lee should bear the responsibility for his words and deeds in
trying to split the motherland, the article says, emphasizing that
the "one China" principle is the foundation and prerequisite for
the development of the cross-Straits relations and the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lee has destroyed this foundation for contacts, exchanges, and
dialogs between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, and this runs
directly counter to the fundamental interests of compatriots
across the Straits, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It says the Chinese people from across the straits expect to
develop the cross-straits relations and reunify the motherland,
and anyone who attempts to hinder this trend is over-estimating
his ability and is doomed to fail.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaria has claimed more than 95
lives in a district of west Kenya in the past one and a half
months, health ministry officials have disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one people died in June and 34 others in July in Uasin
Gishu District of Rift Valley Province in west Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 6,225 hospital inmates, 4,106 were infected with
malaria in June while this month there were 1,670 patients.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assistant Minister for Health Basil Criticos said
Friday that chloroquin had become ineffective in the treatment of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said that malaria was found to be 80 percent resistance to
chloroquine in Uasin Gishu District of Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that there was an acute shortage of quinine
used in the treatment of malaria. But he said patients were
responding well to Fansidar even though it was expensive.
</P>
<P>
Criticos said many patients preferred using chloroquin because
it was cheap and readily available.
</P>
<P>
Jack Nyamonga from the ministry's headquarters said malaria
cases would fall by mid-August due to a weather change.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Remain in Albania as Partner: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko said on Saturday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) will remain a present partner and cooperator in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Majko made this remark after he visited the command of NATO
forces on "humanitarian mission" in Albania (AFOR).
</P>
<P>
NATO is a guarantee not only for peace in the region, but also
for partnership, Majko was quoted as saying by the Albanian
Telegraphic Agency (ATA).
</P>
<P>
Concerning the settlement of NATO forces in Albania under a new
name after AFOR's mission ends, Majko noted that the name is not
important, the Albanian government will guarantee the
implementation of the plans it signed with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Majko, accompanied by John Reith, commander of AFOR, also paid
a visit to Kukes in northern Albania on Saturday. He praised the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and NATO for
their role in aid mission.
</P>
<P>
Reith said that the cooperation between NATO and Albania will
continue to be strong even in the future.
</P>
<P>
A decision on the future of NATO forces in Albania could be
expected on Monday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Albania signed a plan of partnership for peace with NATO in
February 1994, which allows some political and military
cooperation between the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Searchers swept the waters
off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the United States
Saturday, pressing a desperate hunt for John F. Kennedy Jr., son
of the former U.S. president, his wife and her sister, whose plane
had vanished on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a suitcase bearing the name of Lauren Bessette,
sister-in-law of John F. Kennedy Jr., was found on the shore of
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
Fears grew that America's most renowned political family had
suffered another ghastly tragedy. The couple had been en route to
Cape Cod and a Kennedy cousin's wedding -- now postponed and
replaced with prayers for the missing. The plane left an airfield
in New Jersey State at 8:45 p.m. (local time) Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We're still pursuing an active search-and-rescue mission.
There's always hope," said Gary Jones of the Coast Guard office in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke with members of the Kennedy
family Saturday after he was told John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane had
disappeared, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of the 35th president,
and was born just two months before his father's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
His father's assassination immediately thrust him into the
public eye with the poignant photo of the little boy saluting as
his funeral procession passed.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics.
After graduating from Brown University, he went to law school and
joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.

<P>
India has large number of youth population among other

Vikram Charitable Trust.
</P>
<P>
With youth population expected to go up to 510 million by 2016,
which is about 40 percent of the entire population in the country,
India needs a matching infrastructure, a comprehensive and
progressive agenda to fulfill their growing needs and soaring
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at thrashing out various issues confronting this
important segment of the population, a three-day seminar, "Towards
a Policy For Young Adults", will be held here from July 22 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Urivi Vikram Charitable Trust and
the Department of Youth Affairs And Sports under the Ministry of
Human Resource Development, would be attended by representatives
of youth from all over the country, Rao told the press here today.

<HEADLINE> "Undermining Cross-Straits Relations Inadmissible" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui is taking a very
dangerous step by redefining cross-Straits relations as "state-to-
state", which reveals his intention to separate Taiwan from China,
according to a commentary from Xinhua News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that the "one China" principle is the
foundation and prerequisite for the development of cross-Straits
relations and the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lee has strayed too far down the separatist path and has put at
risk the future of Taiwan and its people, said the article, adding
that Lee's remarks have plunged cross-Straits relations, which
have been developing smoothly in recent years, into unprecedented
difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1979, the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress proposed in its Letter to the Taiwan Compatriots:
"The 'one China' principle and opposition to independence for
Taiwan should be the common stand and foundation for the
development of cross-Straits relations".
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Deng Xiaoping put forward the creative framework of "
peaceful reunification, and one country with two systems" for the
purpose of solving the Taiwan problem, with the prerequisite of
one China.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed in his
eight-point proposition for promoting the peaceful reunification
of the motherland that the "one China" principle is the foundation
and prerequisite for realizing the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang again stressed the "one China" principle and strong
opposition to "independence for Taiwan", as well as "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan" in the report of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He stated that no foreign forces will be allowed to interfere
in the Taiwan issue nor any forces allowed to change by any means
the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1992 the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
and Taiwan's Straits Exchanges Foundation reached a common
understanding that both sides of the Taiwan Straits should abide
by the "one China" principle, and they conducted a series of
consultations, exchanges and dialogs based on this principle.
</P>
<P>
To sum up, through 20 years of contacts and exchanges, the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits witnessed a steady development in
their relations.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that Lee Teng-hui is a person who is trying to
hinder the historical trend of moving toward reunification of the
motherland. His remarks in defiance of the "one China" principle
have seriously affected the relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Prior to stepping down from office, Lee Teng-hui has made
separatist remarks which will bring nothing but harm the interests
of the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The article warned Lee Teng-hui sternly that on no account
should the "one China" principle be undermined, or he will bear
the responsibility for it and become a historical sinner by trying
to separate Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
The article said that it is the sublime wish of the Chinese
people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to realize peaceful
reunification of the motherland, which conforms to their
fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
It is always a solid policy of the Chinese government and
people to develop cross-Straits relations and promote peaceful
reunification of the motherland.

HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's business community
Sunday welcomed the move by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to disburse 200 million U.S. dollars in the next 14-months to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
President of the Indigenous Business Development Community Ben

there is need of this facility which has been long overdue.
Although it is not enough and falls far too short of what we
require here, we hope the money will help the economy to improve."
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail reported that the IMF had finally agreed to
disburse 200 million U.S. dollars over the next 14 months starting
from two weeks' time under a new balance of payments support
agreement.

<P>
Chief Executive of Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce wOnder

business community which will derive a wide range of financial
benefits which will sustain the economy of Zimbabwe more

had so far been fragmented.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been no concerted effort to add value to the
country's economic activities and that jobs had been lost and
people urged to tighten their belts.
</P>
<P>
The agreement puts an end to almost two years of waiting by
Zimbabwe to receive the balance of payments support from the IMF
expected to shore up the country's ailing economy, strengthen the
local currency and unlock more than 300 million U.S. dollars
support from other international donors.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Affirms Adherence to One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Sunday that it
consistently adheres to the one-China policy and will never
establish official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Egypt, An Huihou,
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for Asian Affairs, Nagi Al-
Ghadrifi, stressed that Egypt maintains the one-China policy as
its constant position on dealing with the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ghadrifi affirmed to An that his country's policy on the
Taiwan issue will remain unchanged regardless of any remarks made
by any person.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, leader of the Taiwanese authorities, claimed in
an interview with a German radio early this month that the Taiwan
authorities had defined the cross-Straits relations as "state-to-
state, or at least special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has condemned Lee's remarks as an utter
exposure of his premediated intentions to divide China's territory
and sovereignty, and create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan"
or "Taiwan's independence."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and China enjoy close, solid and friendly relations of
cooperation and the leaders of the two countries maintain
coordination and consultations on regional and international
issues, Al-Ghadrifi said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that any provocative remarks made by the Taiwan
authorities will not shake Egypt's firm stance on the one-China
policy.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Myanmar Condemn Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese and
Chinese-Myanmar residing in Yangon held a forum at the Chinese
Embassy here Sunday, strongly condemning Lee Tenghui's recent
separatist remarks over cross-Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Attended the forum were more than 50 representatives from 17
overseas Chinese (OC) associations in Yangon including the OC
Chamber of Commerce, associations of Fujian Natives, Yunnan
Natives and Guangdong Natives.
</P>
<P>
The attendees pointed out at the forum that Lee's separatist
remarks are bound to end with failure.
</P>
<P>
The forum adopted a joint statement as follows:
</P>
<P>
Lee Tenghui claimed in an interview on July 9 by a German media
that Taipei now regards the ties between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait as "matters between two states" or "at least a
special state-to-state matter" between them.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist remarks have barely exposed his consistent and
deliberate plot to divide China's territory and sovereignty, and
create "Two Chinas", "One China, One Taiwan" and "Taiwan
Independence".
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks are, in essence, to vainly attempt breaking up
Taiwan from China and its crucial point is to negate the principle
of One China.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all that there is only one China in the world
and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Reunification of motherland is a sacred aim that nationalities
of the whole world pursue. Chinese nationality is a great
nationality who founded the world's most long-standing unified
country.
</P>
<P>
Reunification of motherland is one of the most important
standard norms of value of an ancient civilized China.
</P>
<P>
Any remarks and acts, aimed at splitting, refusal of
reunification and creating obstacles over relations between the
two sides of the strait, is a betrayal to the country and
nationality. It will be strongly opposed by the Chinese people,
including the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Any plot challenging against the principle of One China,
creating "Two Chinas", "'One China, One Taiwan" and "Taiwan
Independence" is doomed to failure. Any people attempting to split
the motherland will be cast aside by the history and will become a
culprit of the nationality.

<HEADLINE> Taliban not to Yield to US Pressure on Osama: Omar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The supreme leader of the ruling
Afghan Taliban, Mulla Muhammad Omar Sunday said they will not
surrender to the U.S. pressure to hand over the Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Omar said Washington does not have the right to
ask for the extradition of Osama, who was accused by the States of
masterminding the bomb blasts in U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last August.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban would welcome to embrace martyrdom but will never
succumb to the demands for expulsion of Osama, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed the U.S. Statement Department warning to
the Americans in Pakistan that they should be much careful as the
Afghan extremists are planning to attack U.S. interests in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently imposed trade and economic sanctions
on the Taliban in a bid to force the group to extradite Osama.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, said Afghanistan and the United States
have no extradition treaty and hence they are not bound to hand
him over to Washington.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Condemns Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and
Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
issued a statement today severely condemning Lee Teng-hui's
separatist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Lee said on July 9 in an interview with a German radio station
that cross-Straits relations should be defined as "state-to-state,
or at least special state-to-state relations". This was echoed
later by other Taiwanese officials, who said that cross-Straits
talks are "bilateral talks between two states".
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist remarks have posed a great threat to cross-
Straits relations and harmed the stability of cross-Straits
relations, in disregard of the desire of all Chinese in the world
to seek peaceful reunification, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that there is only one China in the
world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides across the Taiwan Straits have not yet become
unified, but the status of Taiwan as an inalienable part of China
has never been changed, and the "one-China" principle has been
recognized by most countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist remarks have been widely criticized by people
on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and by overseas Chinese, while
arousing alarm among Taiwan's people and leading to a downward
plunge of Taiwan's stock market.
</P>
<P>
The international community has also expressed disagreement
with the assertions of "independence for Taiwan", "Two Chinas" and
"One China, One Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The committee repeatedly warned both Lee and the Taiwan
authorities not to underestimate the firm resolve of the Chinese
government to safeguard state sovereignty, dignity and territorial
integrity or the courage and strength of the Chinese people to
fight against separatism and "independence for Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Lee must stop playing with fire and stop all activities aimed
at separating Taiwan from the motherland, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed the intention to increase
exchanges with all parties and groups, and people of all walks of
life in Taiwan on the basis of the policies of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems", in order to improve
mutual understanding and to hasten the peaceful reunification of
the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks With New Zealand PM (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and
visiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley exchanged views
today on bilateral relations, APEC and other international and
regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between the two prime ministers, Zhu said that
New Zealand will host the informal leadership meeting of APEC
members this September, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin will pay
a state visit to New Zealand, adding that the visit will be a
major event in Sino-New Zealand ties and have a far-reaching
impact upon the stable development of bilateral relations since it
will be the first state visit to that country by a Chinese
President.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that China and New Zealand have maintained a good
development momentum in bilateral ties, and the two have conducted
active dialogue and cooperation on international and regional
issues. The two countries have also registered achievements in
bilateral cooperation in the military, cultural, educational and
tourism fields.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-New Zealand trade volume witnessed a big increase last
year, compared with that in 1997, Zhu said, adding that the two
countries are both influential ones in the Asia-Pacific region and
they shoulder the common responsibility to maintain world peace
and stability, and to promote regional economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
China and New Zealand are complementary in their economies, and
China is ready to work together with New Zealand to advance
bilateral cooperation in every area, Zhu told Shipley.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that her current China tour is aimed at boosting
bilateral friendship and exploring new ways for bilateral
cooperation in various areas. The government and people of New
Zealand are looking forward to President Jiang's state visit to
their country in September, which will be of great significance
and will promote the all-round development of bilateral friendly
cooperation, she said.
</P>
<P>
She told Zhu that New Zealand also hopes to conduct an in-
depth exchange of opinions with China to coordinate bilateral
positions to ensure more achievements at the upcoming APEC
leadership meeting in New Zealand.

<P>
The New Zealand prime minister also briefed Zhu on her country'
s view on the major topics to be discussed at the upcoming APEC
meeting, and stressed that New Zealand pays great attention to
trade and investment liberalization, the strengthening of market
functions and the economic participation of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Taiwan issue, Shipley said that her government
firmly upholds the "one China" policy, and will properly handle
the Taiwan affair strictly in accordance with the relevant APEC
memorandum of understanding. The stand was appreciated by the
Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that China highly values the role of
APEC as the most important forum for economic cooperation in the
Asia-Pacific, saying that it has made a great contribution to
enhancing regional economic cooperation, coordinating the economic
interests of its members and promoting economic growth in the
region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zhu said, APEC has provided an important regular
meeting place for the leaders of the major countries of the region,
and its role in resolving international, regional and bilateral
issues has been widely acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier stressed that APEC should, in accordance
with the actual situations and needs of its members, promote trade
and investment liberalization at an appropriate pace, step up
economic and technological cooperation, and help resolve problems
for members that have been hit by the Asian financial crisis, to
realize its goal of narrowing gaps between members and achieving
common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It is the belief of the Chinese Government, he said, that APEC
will play a greater role in regional and global economic
cooperation with the economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since joining APEC in 1991, China has made vigorous efforts in
various fields of endeavor of the organization, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Enters UNSCOM Laboratory in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A visiting U.N. technical team,
which is entrusted to remove toxic chemical agents left behind by
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, entered
UNSCOM's laboratory in Baghdad on Sunday, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's representative
in Iraq, made the remarks at a press conference held in the
U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center (BMVC).
</P>
<P>
Shah said that in the last three days, the U.N. technical team
which arrived here on Wednesday, has been making preparations for
entering UNSCOM's chemical laboratory and biological room.
</P>
<P>
He said that at 11:30 local time (8:30 GMT), accompanied by himself
and three diplomatic observers from the Chinese, Russian and
French embassies in Baghdad, the U.N. team opened the laboratory
and commenced their work.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team groups four chemical experts from the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in
the Hague and an independent biological weapons expert.
</P>
<P>
They are from China, Russia, South Africa, Poland and
Germany. Yako Yalato, a Finnish, former assistant director of
BMVC, acts as guide for the U.N. team.
</P>
<P>
Shah said the U.N. team would destroy all of the mustard gas
samples and other chemical agents, close the chemical laboratory
and the biological room and then report to the U.N., adding that
the whole process will be videotaped.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team is expected to begin the destruction of the
chemical agents and mustard gas samples from Monday morning, and
the process will take about three days, said Shah.
</P>
<P>
He said all the chemical agents would be neutralized
through chemical process inside the chemical laboratory and
biological room in a best possible manner.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an agreement last month on the
composition of the technical team to close UNSCOM's Baghdad
laboratory where one kilogram of mustard gas and VX gas were
reportedly left behind by UNSCOM before it withdrew from Iraq
last December.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not resumed its work of weapons inspections in
Iraq since last December when the United States and Britain
launched four-night airstrikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chinese in Macao Condemn Lee's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Returned Overseas
Chinese in Macao held a meeting Saturday to condemn the separatist
remarks by Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting indignantly denounced Lee Teng-
hui's attempt to split the motherland, warning that "the one who
plays with fire will get burnt."
</P>
<P>
The separatist scheme of Lee Teng-hui has seriously harmed
cross-Strait relations and stability, undermined the process of
peaceful reunification, and ignored the desire of the Taiwanese
people to seek peace and development, the participants said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that for a long period, the central government has
been exerting unremitting efforts together with people throughout
the country to push forward the great cause of reunifying the
country. To settle the Taiwan question and achieve the complete
reunification of the motherland are the strong aspiration and
sacred mission of all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The participants reiterated their view that there is only one
China in the world, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China. Any actions of deliberate separatism will be vehemently
opposed by all Chinese people including the compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The participants said that they would persistently hold the "
one-China" stance, firmly safeguard national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and fight against any separatist actions.

<HEADLINE> China's Civil Aviation Does Well In June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The latest figures show that the
gross transportation turnover, passenger traffic volume, and
freight and mail traffic volume of China's civil aviation sector
last month rose by 16.5 percent, 7.3 percent and 27.1 percent,
respectively, on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Insiders attributed the significant increase to the measures
adopted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China to reduce
the number of redundant airplanes and flights over the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that transportation on international
flights and those to Hong Kong and Macao continued to greatly
improve last month, with the gross turnover and passenger traffic
volume increasing by 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The domestic passenger traffic volume also increased by 5.3
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Insiders noted that, due to the sluggish domestic market, it
will still be difficult for China's civil aviation to reach its
target projected earlier this year to turn losses into a profit.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Faces Threat Of Major Summer Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province is
facing the threat of a major summer flooding similar to that of
1998, as a result of sustained rainfall across the province and on
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Located on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, Hunan is home to
four major tributaries of that river and Dongting Lake, and
therefore has always been haunted by the problem of flooding.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the local hydrological departments,
the water level at Chenglingji, where the Yangtze River and
Dongting Lake converge, reached the alarming height of 34 m on
July 3 and has since kept on rising.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the water level at Chenglingji to hit 35.30 m by
July 20, only slightly lower than the all-time high recorded in
the 1998 summer flooding," said an official with the Hunan
Provincial Flood Control Department.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, in the past few weeks more than 1,
000 sections of the over 3,000 km of dykes around Dongting Lake
have faced the threat of breaches under the high pressure of the
flood water.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the Hunan Provincial Government has
urged all relevant departments across the province to adopt an
around-the-clock monitoring system and make timely and full
preparations for any possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, more than one million officials, residents
and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the armed
police units stationed in cities and regions around Dongting Lake,
including Changde, Yueyang and Yiyang, have been mobilized to
patrol the lake dykes day and night.
</P>
<P>
From July to September last year, the entire Yangtze River
basin was hit by China's worst flooding in decades, resulting in
more than 3,000 deaths and direct economic losses of over 200
billion yuan. Hunan was one of the most severely afflicted
provinces.

DHAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's currency, the taka, was
devalued by 2 percent from 48.35/48.65 taka per U.S. dollar to
49.35/49.65 taka per dollar on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Bangladesh Bank, the central bank,
said the new buying/selling middle rate will be 49.5 taka against
the previous 48.5 taka.
</P>
<P>
The bank last devalued the currency by about 3 percent in
October last year.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation was aimed at boosting exports and encouraging
remittance from Bangladeshis working abroad, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The export products would be more competitive and would help
contribute to the foreign exchange reserves following the
depreciation, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's House Speaker Advised to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the ruling People's
Democratic Party (PDP) may have advised embattled Speaker of the
House of Representative Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari to step aside
quietly to save the reputation of the party.
</P>
<P>
Following a consultation at the weekend, party Chairman Chief
Solomon Lar, National Secretary Okwesilieze Nwodo and other top
party leaders considered the resignation option as the most
honorable in the event of the impeachment alternative.
</P>
<P>
One of the leaders said that "we are advising him to resign to
save the reputation of the party and the PDP government," The
Guardian newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The News magazine last Sunday published allegations that Buhari
is 29 and not the 36 years of age he claims to be, and that he
never attended the University of Toronto in Canada which he also
claims to be an alumnus.
</P>
<P>
After the revelation of the forgery, Chairman of the
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Justice Ephraim
Akpata disclosed last week that there were official discoveries of
the alleged false declaration by the security agencies.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on Saturday in Kaduna, northern
Nigeria, Senator Idris Kuta blamed the INEC, the clerk of the
House of Representatives and PDP leaders for suppressing the
petitions against the Speaker on alleged forgery before the
magazine published the issue.
</P>
<P>
The senator said that "before this boy was elected speaker, it
was made absolutely clear that the paper that he used to contest
elections were forged."
</P>
<P>
A top presidency official was quoted as saying on Saturday, "if
he does not want to go quietly, he will only have himself to
blame. The court option will not help him."
</P>
<P>
Members of the House of Representatives have promised to take
the current issue involving Speaker Buhari to its logical
conclusion at the next sitting on Tuesday this week.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion in Three Gorges Reservoir Area Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The serious soil erosion problem
in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, which covers parts of
Chongqing Municipality and Hubei Province, is now basically under
control after a ten-year water and soil conservation effort,
according to the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing and Hubei had reclaimed 12,800 square kilometers. of
eroded land by the end of last year, and the forest-cover rate in
the reservoir area had been increased from 23 percent to 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Reservoir, China's massive hydro-electric
power project now under construction, covers an area 59,300 square
kilometers. In the 1950s, the area's forest coverage rate stood at
between 30 percent and 50 percent. But the figure dropped to a
present 10 percent in some places due to population growth, a
deteriorating ecological environment, and soil erosion over the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
The government named the Three Gorges Reservoir area one of the
country's key water and soil conservation regions in 1988, and has
since launched afforestation projects on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that afforestation in Chongqing and Hubei
prevented 99.29 million tons of mud and sand from entering into
the Three Gorges Reservoir area between 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Officials have called for intensified efforts to further
improve the ecological environment of the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A survey of the ecological
environment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China has
attributed the good water quality of rivers and lakes in Tibet to
afforestation efforts made by local People's Liberation Army
garrisons during the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Tibet Military Area Command mobilized
three million officers and men and used 40,000 motor vehicles for
the campaign to plant trees and grass in Tibet during this period.
</P>
<P>
Members of PLA garrisons planted 20 million trees and four
million square meters of grass, and built 158 shelter belts and
420 orchards over the past 40 years. They have also reclaimed
nearly 667,000 hectares of barren land.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the green area created by PLA members
accounts for 70 percent of Tibet's total cultivated green area.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns Against Israeli Military Buildup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Sunday warned that the strengthening of
Israeli air force and development of its strategic weaponry will
deeply endanger the regional security and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Iran's warning came after the Israeli announcement of purchase
of 60 F-16 fighter jets from the United States within 24 months
during the recent visit of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Once again these efforts by the Israeli regime show that
no country should be deceived by the peace-seeking claims of
the Israeli regime, Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli regime with development of its weapons of mass
destruction and strategic arms is ensuing and intensifying its
expansionist goals, he said, expressing regret over the double
standards adopted by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman warned that regional Arab and Muslim
countries should be watchful on "these hegemonic and suspicious
activities" of the Israeli regime and never be deceived by its
words uttered under its false peace-seeking claims.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli regime with the help of the U.S. has become the
largest arsenal and a source of crisis and insecurity in the
region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Not to Export Natural Gas Now or in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh does not export its
natural gas now and will not export it in the near future, and
this is the word from both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and
opposition leader Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders disagree on everything except the need for
Bangladesh to keep its natural gas for domestic consumption,
unless reserves prove so huge that exports become possible.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the proven natural gas reserve in this South
Asian country stands at 16 trillion cubic feet (TCF), but some
World Bank experts say that Bangladesh's reserves could be as high
as 40 TCF, similar to that of the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
Some oil and gas industry experts also believe that the country
sits on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, both Hasina and Khaleda said the natural gas reserves
have not been measured accurately, arguing that the gas should be
firstly used to supply power to the 85 percent of the country's
over 128 million people who are still inaccessible to electricity.
It means that they have taken a Bangladesh-first stand on the gas
issue.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now heavily dependent on its natural gas as a
source of primary energy with over 80 percent of electricity being
generated with gas-based power plant, and there is little or no
change for the country having an alternative energy source to
replace its natural gas source in near future, according to some
experts.
</P>
<P>
Though the Bangladeshi government is now under severe pressure
from the both multi-national and bilateral donors to take a
decision in favor of exporting natural gas, it has still remained
firm to its avowed principle of not exporting gas.
</P>
<P>
At present, the donor agencies and countries are trying hard to
convince both the government and the opposition to change their
minds and decide to export gas.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the donors have intensified their lobby among
policy-makers, political stalwarts and others concerned, press
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and other donor agencies and countries are
suggesting that Bangladesh could earn 25 billion taka (515.5
million U.S. dollars) a year by exporting gas through pipeline to
its neighboring country of India.
</P>
<P>
But, the Bangladeshi side, while commenting on the
prescription, said the issue of exporting gas would come only
after making a proper assessment of the gas reserves, the
requirement of the country and other prospects.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now producing 925 million cubic feet (MCF) of gas
every day to meet the domestic need, and the demand for gas within
the country would reach 1,235 MCF per day next year against the
supply of about 1,000 MCF showing a deficit of 235 MCF of gas.
</P>
<P>
If the country continues to produce 1,000 MCF of gas per day,
the present explored reserves will continue upto the year 2015,
and during this period of time, the total deficit would reach
2,600 MCF, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The question whether Bangladesh should export its natural gas
has been in focus in the news media, among the experts and
economists and of course among the government officials for some
time now.
</P>
<P>
Opinions on the above question belong to two distinct groups --
one, namely, the foreign oil companies and a lobby supporting
their view argues that Bangladesh should export its natural gas to
help its economy get long demanding foreign earnings, and the
other group, which includes some national experts and leaders,
have expressed their concern over the fact that the country may be
plunged into serious trouble if the present modest gas reserve is
exhausted by allowing pipeline export without ensuring alternative
energy resource for the near future or for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
The national policy-makers should not frame a gas policy on the
basis of foreign companies' "theoretical suggestion" for a very
large gas reserves, and the government must take the
presently-proved gas-reserve estimate into consideration while
considering the question of gas export, stressed Dr. Bedrul Imam,
professor in geology of the Dhaka University.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh should certainly wait for a very large gas deposit
to be proved to satisfy the country's energy need for the next 40
years before it considers gas export, Imam emphasized, adding that
the government should certainly not contemplate exporting gas to a
foreign country with the presently modest gas reserve in hand.

<HEADLINE> 300,000  Displaced People in Uganda </HEADLINE>

<P>
KAMPALA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda had 0.3 million displaced
people inside and 10,000 people in exile in 1998, an international
organization report said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 70,000 Ugandans were internally displaced in 1996 and the
figure rose to 0.3 million in 1998, said the World Disaster Report
1999 compiled by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
 Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, there were 20,000 Ugandans living outside the country
as refugees and asylum seekers and the figure declined to 15,000
in 1994 and further to 10,000 in 1998, according to the report
available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report also reveals that by last year, up to 180,000 people
were living in Uganda as refugees and 300,000 in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Regional conflict in the Great Lakes region and civil strife in
southern Sudan contributed to the tensions in Uganda, not least by
causing population movement," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The publication also said Uganda remains among the world's
poorest countries, plagued by internal conflicts and natural
disasters, despite significant economic progress in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Opposition Groups for Recent Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday blamed the
opposition groups for being behind the recent chaos triggered by a
police crackdown on student protests against the new press law
and the closure of leading moderate daily Salam (Hello).
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry said in a statement that
"orchestrated attempts had been launched by certain
counter-revolutionary groups to misuse the recent events," the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the information obtained and confessions made by
those arrested, some of the people or groups who played an active
role in the recent tumults, had been supported and guided from
abroad and constantly received money through specific bank
accounts," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry failed to give the names of the
opposition groups it pointed its fingers at.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian dailies claimed that the Mujahedin Khalq
Organization (MKO), which was outlawed by Tehran and now based in
Iraq, was behind the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Iranian university students took to the streets and clashed
with the police after the latter launched an unauthorized assault
on the Tehran University dormitory, beating up and arresting
students who gathered at a rally protesting the new press law and
the closure of the Salam daily on July 8.
</P>
<P>
The student protests lasted for six days and were suppressed by
a massive rally arranged by the conservatives on Wednesday in
support of the conservative supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Western countries believed that the student protests are an
indication of Iran's spiraling power struggle between the
conservatives, who dominated most of the country's state organs,
and the moderates, supporters of the reformist President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on Tuesday also blast "foreign and domestic enemies"
for involving in the unrest and warned students of "the black
hands of the enemies."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Muhammadiyah to Accept MPR's Decision on Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's second largest Islamic
organization Muhammadiyah will accept whoever becomes president so
long as he or she is elected by the country's highest
decision-making body, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
"The presidential election has its own mechanism. Muhammadiyah
entrusts the issue to the MPR," Muhammadiyah Deputy Chairman Abdul
Munir Mulkhan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at Muhammadiyah University's graduation ceremony
here, Mulkhan said the escalating debate on who will be president
was caused by different perceptions among the people.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people think that the leader of a winning political
party will be automatically elected as president, he said, adding
that the June election is only to elect the 462 members of the
House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
The remaining 38 DPR seats are reserved for the military, whose
members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The 500 legislators along with another 200 appointed MPR
members will cast their votes in a presidential election set to
take place in November this year.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President B.J. Habibie has been nominated by the
Golkar Party for the upcoming presidential election. He is in
competition with Megawati Soekarnoputri, female leader of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle which has won the June 7
general election.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some Muslim groups have aired their disagreement over
the possibility of a female president in the world's largest
Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party has recommended that only a male
Muslim candidate be eligible for the presidency. Some public
figures have also stated that a woman should not be permitted to
lead the country.
</P>
<P>
But some prominent figures stated that Megawati has more right
than any other contenders to become the country's next president
because her party gained the lion's share of votes in the
election.

<P>
DHAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The existing friendly and bilateral
relations between Bangladesh and Myanmar would be further
strengthened and consolidated in future, President Shahabuddin
Ahmed said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There was a need for further cooperation between the two
countries in various fields for the benefit of the two peoples,
the president told visiting Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
when the latter paid a courtesy call on him. Aung arrived here
Saturday on a three-day visit to the South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the repatriation of the remaining Myanmar refugees
from Bangladesh, Ahmed said that in the mutual interest of the two
countries, it was necessary to resolve the irritating issue at the
earliest time.
</P>
<P>
Aung said that as a neighbor, Myanmar was always eager to
maintain friendly relations with Bangladesh. On the repatriation
problem, he said that he had talks with his Bangladeshi
counterpart, Abdus Samad Azad, in this regard with a view to
working out a solution.
</P>
<P>
Aung and Azad held official talks Saturday on bilateral
relations, particularly the repatriation of the over 20,000
Myanmar refugees, known here as Rohingya refugees, who are living
in two camps in Cox's Bazar, southeast Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Growth In China's Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of the year,
China's township enterprises reported added value output of 1195.7
billion yuan, up 16.5 percent on a year-on-year basis, with
industrial added value output up 14.2 percent to 828.3 billion
yuan, according to Agriculture Ministry statistics.
</P>
<P>
They also indicate a recovery in exports, which amounted to 346.
6 billion yuan, up 7.2 percent from the same period last year.
Profits reached 263.7 billion yuan, a jump of 14.9 percent on a
year-on-year basis and taxes exceeded 90 billion yuan, up 14.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the private sector in these
enterprises continued to grow, with added value output accounting
for 56.8 percent of total output, up 2.3 percent. Jiang Yongtao,
the Ministry's chief economist and director of its Township
Enterprise Bureau, attributes this good performance mainly to
measures to stimulate domestic demand and the enterprises' effort
to adjust production to the market.
</P>
<P>
They still face difficult problems in their development,
however, he says, because banks are reluctant to lend them money,
there are unreasonable charges by some local government
departments, and there are growing restrictions by some countries
on Chinese exports. And, with China's industrial and environmental
protection policies, a large number of the small township steel
mills, coal mines, paper mills, and cement plants are being shut
down, which has affected the middle and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Their development in the middle and western parts of the
country slowed down in the first six months, with added value
output, profits, and exports 5 to 10 percent less than for those
enterprises in the East.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that these enterprises are still not able to
compete with state-owned enterprises on an equal footing, so it is
extremely important for the government to give them more support.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Sticks to One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan and Tibet are the
integrated parts of China and no one can change this fact,
Nepalese leaders told a visiting Chinese delegation here Sunday,
refuting Lee Teng-hui's recent separatist remarks on cross-Strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's clear and consistent stand is that Taiwan and Tibet are
integrated parts of China and Nepal will stick to the one-China
policy now and forever, said former prime minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba and main opposition leader Madhav Kumar Nepal when meeting
with a delegation of the China Association for International
Friendly Contact Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sher Bahadur Deuba, member of the central committee of the
ruling Nepali Congress, said that the Tibet and Taiwan issues are
China's internal affairs and Nepal respects the Chinese
government's stand on this matter.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is one part of China, there is no compromise on this
issue," said Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML), the
main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Nepal supports China's policy on Taiwan and
Tibet and opposes any anti-China activities based in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also attached great importance to the trade
relations between Nepal and China and called on Chinese
businessmen and investors to come to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Sher Bahadur Deuba said Nepal is making great efforts to
attract investments from China on hydro-power projects, tourism
and hotel construction among others.
</P>
<P>
Madhav Kumar Nepal suggested that more routes between Nepal and
Tibet should be opened to promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation is here for a visit from July 17 to July
22.

<P>
URUMQI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Two American scholars who were
wounded in a traffic accident during a scientific study tour in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region early this
morning have been rescued by the Chinese air force, the local
government said here today.
</P>
<P>
The two are Katherine Mino, 49, a female professor of oriental
fine arts history with Chicago University, and Roger Covey, 45,
president of the U.S.-based Tang Research Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The two were carrying out field study in Qiemo County in
southern Xinjiang when the accident occurred. Their Chinese
companion and guide, Professor Luo Xin from the prestigious
Beijing University, was also injured.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the accident, the Qiemo County government formed
a rescue team and also sought assistance from an air force unit
stationed in Xinjiang. The unit immediately sent out a helicopter
to the spot of the accident, which, after four hours of flight,
carried the injured back to Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The three scholars were hospitalized at the PLA Urumqi General
Hospital, one of the local leading medical institutions, and
according to hospital sources, both Americans were in good
conditions after emergency treatment.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Close Economic Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
on Sunday stressed the importance of forging robust economic
relations with Egypt, saying his talks with Egyptian Presidnet
Hosni Mubarak are ``quite constructive.''
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Mkapa
said close economic cooperation between Tanzania and Egypt can be
achieved through increasing visits by trade missions of the two
countries and holding joint industrial fairs.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who will end a four-day visit to Egypt in the day, held
two rounds of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
bilateral ties and issues in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A joint cooperation commission, set up in 1986, is due to meet
later this year, to be co-chaired by foreign ministers of both
countries, Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the commission to focus on ways of enhancing
cooperation between the two countries' private sectors, proposing
that the taxation issues be streamlined.
</P>
<P>
He eulogized a trilateral pact grouping his country, Egypt and the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, under which
Egypt helps Tanzania develop irrigation, agriculture and animal
husbandry by sending experts there.
</P>
<P>
He added that he has met with Egyptian businessmen and asked
them to do business in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mkapa also discussed with Mubarak issues in
Africa. He said Tanzania and Egypt will continue coordination in
seeking ways to help bring an end to the conflicts on the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Claim 8 Kenyan Lives Everyday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- By July 13, 1,484 people had died
on the road this year in Kenya compared with 1,628 in the same
period of 1998, an average eight lives per day, police have said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that most accidents happened during weekends
and holidays. Last weekend alone 18 people died on roads and
during the July 3- 4 weekend, 29 died in separate accidents, the
Sunday Standard reported.
</P>
<P>
According to senior superintendent Mary Wafeka of the Highway
Traffic Headquarters, Kenya's roads of death are rising and the
biggest causes of the accidents are speeding and overloading.
</P>
<P>
Wafeka said the poor conditions of most roads had contributed
enormously to the escalating death toll on roads and many people
now fear to travel on the tattered roads.
</P>
<P>
She also attributed the road carnage to overloading,
unwillingness to comply with traffic rules and road signs, vehicle
defects, road unworthy conditions of some vehicles and improper
overtaking.
</P>
<P>
"The police are now taking action against overloading," she
said, adding the drivers for overloading will be taken to court
and be charged.
</P>
<P>
There had been 1,180 fatal accidents this year, causing 5,343
people seriously injured, 287 more than last year's figure, Wafeka
added.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the Association of Kenya Insurers has so far
lost two billion shillings (some 30 million U.S. dollars) this
year in accident claims.

<HEADLINE> Zambian City Council Workers to be Paid More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Local Government
and Housing of Zambia has accepted a 40, 000 Kwacha (about 16 U.S.
dollars) salary hike across the board for council workers agreed
between Zambia United Local Authorities Workers Union (ZULAWU) and
the Local Government Association of Zambia (LGAZ).
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia quoted Local Government Minister Bennie
Mwiinga as saying here Saturday that his ministry has in
consultations with LGAZ accepted the wage increase but that this
is dependent on the individual council's ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will however continue consulting with other
relevant wings of government to secure a constant source of
revenue to meet the cost of the increase by all councils, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga said he will consult on the implications that may have
after implementing the collective agreement. Eight billion Kwacha
(about 3.2 million dollars) will be required to meet the cost.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga however regretted that ZULAWU has refused to accept the
offer and opted to declare a dispute, thereby shelving all other
ideas discussed and agreed upon relating to financing of local
government.
</P>
<P>
He said it is sad that the union is insisting on the signing of
the collective agreement document regardless of whether or not
individual councils are able to implement the revised salaries and
conditions of service to make it binding on all councils.
</P>
<P>
"This is crucial because if people can't pay what they have
agreed upon, then it is pointless to sign the document," he said.
</P>
<P>
A month ago local authority workers went on strike in protest
against delayed signing of the collective agreement and adequate
funding of councils for increased salaries and conditions of
service.

<HEADLINE> Hunt for August 7 Bombing Terrorists Intensified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
intensified the hunt for terrorists responsible for the bombings
of Nairobi in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania on August 7 last
year.
</P>
<P>
A reward of five million U.S. dollars (350 million Kenyan
shillings) is being offered for information leading to the arrest
of eight suspects, including the alleged financier, Saudi
billionaire Osama bin Laden, the Sunday Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The bounty is out on the heads of other alleged top terrorists
including Muhammad Atef and Mustafa Mohammed Fadhil, who are
alleged to have masterminded the August 7 bombings.
</P>
<P>
The almost simultaneous bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
left 224 people dead mainly in Nairobi, and another 5,000 people
were injured.
</P>
<P>
Four suspects who were arrested in Nairobi are facing murder
charges in a New York court, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The latest efforts to get the prime bombing suspects include
advertizing in both print and electronic media, including the
internet.
</P>
<P>
The American embassy in Nairobi declined comment on the new
effort, referring inquiries to the FBI agents working with Kenyan
security officers in Nairobi in a bid to arrest more suspects, the
paper added.

<HEADLINE> Toxic-waste Ships Heading for Cape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Two huge shipments of highly
 radioactive nuclear fuel are set to pass the Cape of Good Hope
within weeks, sparking outrage from environmentalists who warn
that spillage could spell disaster.
</P>
<P>
Green groups planning to hold protests in Cape Town tomorrow
said the possibility of sea contamination through leakage or
accident could not be ruled out because of the Cape's treacherous
seas, particularly at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has identified the two ships as the Pacific Pintail
and the Pacific Teal, both of which are owned and operated by
Pacific Nuclear Transport, a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels,
Sunday Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Teal passed through South African waters two years
ago, provoking a storm of protest. The vessel sparked further
outrage when it breached an undertaking not to come within 200
nautical miles of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South African Environment Minister Mohammed Valli Moosa said he
knew nothing of the planned shipment, but said he would
investigate immediately.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for British Nuclear Fuels, John Barber, confirmed
that two vessels were being prepared to ship nuclear fuel from
Europe to Japan. He said he would not release more details until
the ships were actually under way, but added that no countries
along the route had been consulted.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Greenpeace said the shipments contained "enough
fissile material to construct 60 nuclear bombs, more than the
entire Indian and Pakestani nuclear arsenals."
</P>
<P>
Although there were three possible routes the ships could
follow, the one around the Cape was the most likely, Greenpeace
said.

<HEADLINE> Changsha Cinema Tries New Way to Attract Moviegoers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Moviegoers in Changsha, capital
of central China's Hunan Province, can now see a film and pay for
the ticket afterwards.
</P>
<P>
And they don't have to worry about the price, because they can
pay whatever they like when they leave the cinema.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract a larger audience, the Changsha Film
City, one of the largest cinemas in Changsha, has been running its
business in this way for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Outside the movie theater people see an appealing advertisement
that reads "You can see the film 'Unusual Love' in an unusual way:
first enjoy, then pay as much as you like."
</P>
<P>
The cinema's manager, who gave his name as Huang, said that
after a week-long experiment, the cinema found out that its box
office take was unexpectedly high, and decided to continue this
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the audience paid for their tickets after
seeing the film in amounts anywhere from four or five yuan each to
as high as 50 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some moviegoers admitted that they were first attracted to the
cinema by its advertisement, but then they found that the film "
Unusual Love" was really worth their time and money.
</P>
<P>
They said the film, which features a love story between a
doctor's assistant and her husband who lose consciousness for 19
years, is an excellent one, very touching and true to life.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that good Chinese films do appear from time to time
thanks to the efforts of a new generation of directors and
producers, though many Chinese moviegoers have lost interest in
Chinese films because of their mediocrity and lack of creativity.
</P>
<P>
With new ways of attracting an audience such as this one,
people may eventually give up their prejudice against Chinese
films and help lift the sluggish domestic film industry out of its
doldrums, he added.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
He said that the bank's new progress in the first half of this

remittance settlement system, the expansion of its online business
outlets from 5,000 to more than 8,000, as well as a series of new
internal control measures to minimize financial risks.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of this year, the ICBC will continue to
support selected quality enterprises and projects, and will make
efforts to develop new credit businesses, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Samples From China's North Pole Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese expedition to the
North Pole has obtained its first group of samples from the
Chukchi Sea and this has led to some interesting observations.
</P>
<P>
They have collected 13 boxes of samples from drilling at 5
spots, with sample more than 3 meters in length, according to
Doctor Gao Aiguo, a marine geologist. The samples contain
information about the environment for more than 100,000 years, he
says, because two or three centimeters represent a thousand years
of development.
</P>
<P>
He says that organic matter accounts for 5 percent of the
marine deposits beneath the Arctic. Studies of these deposits can
help scientists track ancient environmental and climate changes
and in turn provide information about preventing some natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
They have also collected more than 30 bottles of samples of
creatures living at the bottom of the sea, says Zheng Fengwu, a
marine biologist, and these say something about environmental
pollution and mineral resources and studies on them will
contribute to environmental protection, mineral resource
exploration, and studies of the geological structure and changes
of climate.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will spend 10 days in the Chukchi Sea and will
conclude their visit in September.

United States in a deal worth 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, making it
the largest ever defense contract signed by the state.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made over the weekend by Prime Minister Ehud

to 60 additional fighters within 24 months.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:

<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton will announce in a joint communique that the strategic
cooperation between the two countries will be upgraded.

Sources close to Barak also said that the U.S. has agreed to

<HEADLINE> IMF to Release Loan to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has finally agreed to disburse 200 million U.S. dollars to
Zimbabwe over the next 14 months starting from two weeks' time
under a new balance of payments support agreement, The Sunday Mail
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This puts an end to almost two years of an agonizing wait by
Zimbabwe to receive the much needed balance of payments support
which was expected to prop up the country's ailing economy,
strengthen the local currency as well as unlock over 300 million
U.S. dollars support from other international donors.
</P>
<P>
IMF Resident Representative Robert Franco Friday confirmed that
all the outstanding issues had now been resolved between the IMF
and the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa signed the
Letter of Intent for the new facility on Friday night. "All the
outstanding issues have been resolved and we are ready for
disbursement in about two weeks."
</P>
<P>
This follows a recent visit to the Bretton Woods institute's
Washington headquarters by a two-man Zimbabwean delegation,
accompanied by Franco for meetings with senior IMF management.
"We have now been given the green light and there are no
outstanding issues," Franco said.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF will also send a team to Zimbabwe next month to
discuss a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility which
comes much cheaper at 0.5 percent interest compared to the 5
percent interest charged under the standby arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Search for Missing Plane Brings Fears of Another Kennedy Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Hope dimmed late Saturday for
John F. Kennedy Jr., son of the former U.S. president, his wife
and sister-in-law, as darkness descended on the waters off Martha'
s Vineyard in Massachusetts State where their plane went down.
</P>
<P>
Fears grew that America's most renowned political family had
suffered another ghastly tragedy. Debris washed ashore, but there
was no sign of life.
</P>
<P>
The couple went to Massachusetts State to attend the wedding of
the young Kennedy's cousin. The plane left an airfield in New
Jersey State at 8:45 p.m. (local time) Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you miraculous stories of people surviving," said
Rear Admiral Richard M. Larrabee, first Coast Guard district
commander, at a late afternoon news conference in Massachusetts."I
can tell you in previous cases like this, we've searched as many
as three or four days. We're not ready to give up on this yet."
</P>
<P>
While the visual aerial search was suspended for the night late
Saturday, three helicopters with infrared sensors and Coast Guard
boats with bright lights and a sonar-equipped submersible
continued searching overnight in the dark, Coast Guard officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guardsmen and Air National Guardsmen were equipped with
night vision goggles, and an Air National Guard C-130 airplane was
flying through the night coordinating the search effort, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Todd Burgun.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said National Transportation Safety Board
investigators already were at work on the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard identified the plane as a single-engine, six-
seat Piper Saratoga II HP, acquired recently by the Kennedy. The
plane is known in the aviation industry as a high-performance
airplane with a good safety record.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of the 35th president,
and was born just two months before his father's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
His father's assassination immediately thrust him into the
public eye with the poignant photo of the little boy saluting as
his funeral procession passed.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Falls Below 2 Percent In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in 17 years,
Indian annual rate of inflation fell to 1.83 percent for the week
ended July 3, due mainly to a steady decline in vegetable prices.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics published here on Sunday showed that the
index for vegetables during the week was at 430.6 as against 699.1
in the correspondent period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase in prices, based on the wholesale price
index, declined by 0.20 percentage points to 1.83 percent in the
week from 2.03 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
The falling trend was also helped by a slackness in industrial
demand, which kept the prices of manufactured products low.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest inflation rate since August 1982 when it
touched 1.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal, prices of agricultural produce remained
rocksteady due to a bumper crop harvest in the last season.
</P>
<P>
Foodgrain production in 1998-99 is estimated to have touched a
record 205 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the record lows in inflation, the retail prices
measured by consumer price index for urban non-manual employees
are still ruling high at 6.1 percent in June compared to a monthly
average of 2.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the three major groups in the wholesale price index,
primary articles is at 1.38 percent, followed by manufactured
products at 1.73 percent, and fuel, power, light and lubricants at
3.76 percent.

ABU DHABI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will maintain its ban on import of British beef despite the
European Commission's decision to allow Britain U.K. to export
cattle meat.
</P>
<P>
The issue of lifting the ban on British beef must be taken up
by the UAE's General Secretariat of Municipalities (GSM), the Gulf
News daily on Sunday quoted Dubai Municipality sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, there is no scheduled meeting for
the GSM at the moment due to the unavailibility of most officials
who are on holiday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission on Wednesday lifted the world-wide ban
on British beef, which was imposed three years ago over fears of
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
In the UAE, the ban was imposed in April 1996. The
UAE's major sources of beef imports, currently, are Australia,
India and New Zealand.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai said here Sunday that during his tenure of
office, he will foster and strengthen as much as possible the
friendship between Nepal and China.
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep and preserve and strengthen more the

International Friendly Contact, a national non-governmental
organization in China.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai noted that as is known to all, there are only two

China in the north and India in the south.
</P>
<P>
"We have been keeping very good relations with both countries,"

He held that "we have been keeping very good relations with
China for hundred years," and the relations entered a new period
with the exchange of ambassadors in 1955.

"Don't believe those ill-intended remarks that we fear the
Chinese. We like them. We get political and economic support from
China and we have people-to-people contact," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I ensure you friendship from all sides (in Nepal)," he added.
He took office as prime minister of Nepal on May 31.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gold Industry Calls for Tax Exemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Exemption of the seven percent
value-added tax (VAT) is vital to retain competitiveness of the
Thai gold industry, a veteran trader said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jitti Tangsithipakdi, president of the Gold Traders'
Association, said at the seminar "How can the Thai gold industry
survive?" that the seven percent VAT is the key factor hindering
increasing consumption and the competitiveness of the Thai gold
industry.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the gold demand in Thailand before the economic
crisis, the total sales volume has dropped by 80 percent, and
resulted in the shutting down of more than 3,000 gold businesses
and over 100,000 goldsmiths left unemployed, Jitti said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that more gold shops will be closed and more
goldsmiths made redundant in Thailand if the industry fails to
prepare for the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) pact which takes
effect on certain products, including gold, early next year.
</P>
<P>
The freer trade will allow cheaper gold products, particularly
from Malaysia and Indonesia, to flood into the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is alone in the region in imposing a seven percent VAT
on gold transactions. Malaysia once had a tax of around 10 percent
tax on gold, but scrapped it to stimulate its gold industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- India declared on Saturday that
the war in the Kargil area of Kashmir was over as what New Delhi
termed as "intruders" had withdrew from the Indian side of the
line of control (LOC), the de facto border between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Intrusion from Pakistan" in Kargil had practically ended and
Indian forces had already advanced to the LOC in three out of the
four sub-sectors in the combat zone, Defense Minister George
Fernandes announced here late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"The war in Kargil has come to an end. The last of the
Pakistani intruders have vacated our territory," Fernandes told a
fund donation meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the intruders had retreated from even the few
heights they were holding in the Mushkoh Valley as the extended
deadline for withdrawal expired at the first light Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian Army issued shoot-and-kill orders yesterday
if any Pakistan soldier or militant was found south of the LOC.
</P>
<P>
Bikram Singh, a spokesman for the Indian Army, said Saturday at
the regular news briefing that any intruder found on the Indian
side of the LOC would be treated as hostile and be shot and
killed.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Factsheet (1): Brief Introduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is hosting the 32nd
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on July 23-24. A brief introduction to
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) follows:
</P>
<P>
ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967 with the signing of the
ASEAN Declaration, otherwise known as the Bangkok Declaration, by
the ministers of foreign affairs of Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN later expanded to include Brunei in 1984, Vietnam in
1995, Laos and Myanmar in 1997, and Cambodia in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region spans an area of some 5.48 million square
kilometers where 14 official languages are spoken and about seven
religions adhered to. And its population is estimated at 494.84
million.
</P>
<P>
Organization structure of ASEAN comprises summit meeting (the
highest authority of ASEAN bringing together the heads of
government of the member countries), ministerial meetings,
standing committee, secretariats, committees and senior officials'
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Founded in Bangkok on the principal objective of accelerating
economic growth and increasing the stability of the Southeast
Asian region, ASEAN has grown into one of the most dynamic
political and economic organizations of developing countries and
has been playing a significant role in maintaining peace and
stability and helping promote economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea became an observer of ASEAN in 1995 and is now
the only observer nation of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has 10 dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, Russia, New Zealand, South Korea and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bank Heists Rise in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-one bank branches
have encountered holdups in the past six and a half months in
Argentina, with the robbers making away with more than 11 million
pesos (11 million U.S. dollars), doubling the figure in terms of
money for 1998, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thieves seem to like Tuesdays and Wednesdays, as 35 of the 71
holdups were made on those days of the week, according to police
statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 126 bank branches were robbed in the country, with a
booty of more than 6 million pesos (6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The frequency of heists, which demonstrated that the robbers
knew in detail the movements of the bank and the location of the
vault, made investigators suspect police participation in those
robberies.
</P>
<P>
A public prosecutor one month ago detained a police officer
accused of taking part in the holdup of a bank in the city of
Pilar, some 50 kilometers northwest of Buenos Aires, from which
the thieves took 33,000 pesos (33,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The most recent robbery was carried out last Tuesday in the
Banco Nacion branch in Buenos Aires City, after a shoot-out with
police.
</P>
<P>
Six of the 71 bank robberies perpetrated this year were
resolved by police, although only in two cases the stolen money
was recovered.

CARACAS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan hospitals are in bad
need of resources and forensic experts have stopped practicing
autopsies as economic and political crisis hit the country hard.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Boris Bossio, Legal Medicine Department director in the
state of Miranda, the Caracas newspaper El Nacional reported
Saturday that a budget of 100,000 bolivars (166 U.S. dollars) a
month for autopsies is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
Forensic experts in Miranda, a state located in Caracas
metropolis with the second biggest rate of crime in the country
and the second most populated, with 2.5 million residents, have to
use their own vehicles to pick up bodies of people who died in
undetermined violent circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Besides, corpses have to be taken directly to funeral homes,
since refrigerated chambers in hospitals do not work, and no funds
are available to repair them, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in Costa Rica has
suspended 50 surgical operations and declared a state of medical
emergency after six patients were diagnosed to have been infected
by a disease caused by the lethal "meat-eating bacteria."
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the Max Peralta Hospital of Cartago said
Saturday that 50 surgical operations that had been planned were
suspended, and as a preventive measure, the access of the public
to the hospital, 20 kilometers south of San Jose, had been
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The six patients infected by the bacteria had been isolated.
</P>
<P>
Known as "necrotizing fasceitis" and also called the "meat-
eating infection," the disease is caused by a bacterium that
destroys the infected tissue under the skin.
</P>
<P>
The Cartago hospital authorities said the six patients, three
of them seriously sick, are stable and out of danger.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Social Security Institute Medical Manager Fernando
Ferraro said the infection came from outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Trying to dispel panic among the populace, he said the
infection was not an epidemic, but a sheer coincidence that
several cases had occurred at the same time.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Expected to Further Cut Internet Access Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's telecom administration is
considering to further lower the country's Internet access fees
under the increasing pressure of Internet users, according to
today's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend to cut fees to an affordable level, further price
adjustments are being considered," Chen Yin, a division chief of
the planning and development department with China Telecom
Administration Bureau, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen, who is responsible for Internet-related prices,
didn't disclose the exact schedule of the price cut.
</P>
<P>
The telecom administration had already lowered charges over
Internet access by a large margin in March this year. The price
cut contributed to the explosive growth of Internet users in the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese Internet users has hit 4 million by the
first six months this year, according to the latest statistics
from the China Internet Network Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The figures, showing the number of dial-up users at 2.56
million, have almost doubled last year's 2.1 million users.
</P>
<P>
"The growth momentum could hit more than 100 percent a year in
the coming years," Mao Wei, director of the Center, told China
Daily. "But another great leap this year has to do with the
stimuli of price cuts."
</P>
<P>
According to the Center's survey, Chinese Internet users mainly
suffer from the low speed of the connection when accessing
websites and the relatively high costs. Complaints about speed
represent 49.3 percent and complaints about costs account for 36.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> China To Restructure Tax Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to overhaul its
tax agency sector to improve the image of tax agent institutions,
today's China Daily Business Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation (SAT) recently made an
announcement that it is launching a general campaign to uncouple
tax agent institutions from tax bureaus and purge those that have
been "illegally established", said the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"All tax agencies set up by or in the name of tax bureaus must
be disconnected by the end of this year," the SAT was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Daily, many of China's tax bureaus have
been engaged in the business of tax agents. They set up new firms
and a number of tax officials also act as tax agents.
</P>
<P>
With such close ties with tax authorities, these agencies are
illegally managed by tax bureaus, especially when competing for
clients, insiders say.
</P>
<P>
"This has, on the contrary, blunted the competitiveness of the
agents," Zhou Shaojun, director of the Beijing Zerui Taxation
Consultation Service, told the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The profession is also infected with problems such as
underpricing, tax dodging and even corruption, and subjected to
chaos in some areas, which "causes negative effects on the society
", according to the SAT statement.
</P>
<P>
All bureau-backed agencies must be entirely unhooked from the
taxation system from the point of view of staff, accounting system,
functions and even their names, the SAT requires.
</P>
<P>
Tax agent institutions are not permitted to "transgress the
field of administration of tax bureaus, hog a market share by
misappropriating administrative power, or operate under the name
of tax authorities", says the SAT.
</P>
<P>
Tax agent institutions that were set up without the approval of
provincial or higher authorities are defined as "illegal" and are
ordered to end their business, the China Daily added.

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Guanghua School of Management
of the prestigious Beijing University is offering 200,000 yuan (24,
000 US dollars) for the writing and editing of an MBA(Master of
Business Administration)-program textbook, today's China Daily
Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
With an offer 10 times more than that for an ordinary textbook,
the school hopes to attract top quality writers, Zhang Weiying,
vice director of the school, was quoted as saying by the English
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he believed that using good textbooks is a must, a
way to improve the quality of China's MBA program, although not
the only way.
</P>
<P>
With MBA education developing rapidly in China, criticism has
appeared, targeting the quality of the program as well as the
quality of the professors and students, says the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that paying a fortune for good textbooks is one of
the major measures taken by the school to establish itself as an
internationally recognized business school.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, all textbooks used in MBA training were
translations of foreign textbooks and all the cases studies were
from foreign companies," Zhang was quoted as saying. "We need
textbooks written in Chinese and we need Chinese cases".
</P>
<P>
The Guanghua School of Management, which was founded in 1994,
recruited 240 MBA students this year. Earlier this month, 121
students graduated from the school.

<P>
MANAGUA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of Czech geologists have
recommended evacuation of people from the Casita volcano foothills
to prevent a repetition of a disaster resulted from a rain-caused
landslide.
</P>
<P>
If it rains uninterruptedly for four or more days, it will be
necessary to evacuate the villages close to the volcano, said the
Czech specialists on Saturday, who made a three-month study of the
area with their colleagues of the Nicaraguan Territorial Studies
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Study coordinator Pedro Hradecky said the Pikin Guerrero sector
of the Casita volcano, 130 kilometers northeast of Managua,
presents the same signs seen before the Rolando Rodriguez
community was buried under mud and rocks.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,500 people died last year under an avalanche of
rocks and mud during the rains caused by hurricane Mitch, that
razed the Rolando Rodriguez village, located on the slopes of the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
Official results of the investigation will be revealed in
November, after the Czech geologist group have processed the
information in their country's Geological Service, added Hradecky.

According to the paper, experts in the sector have called for
an opening for years because low liquidity aroused by the narrow
scope of investors has been the biggest problem in the market, but
the government has not yet taken the step.
</P>
<P>
The biggest worry is that allowing foreign currency deposits to
enter the stock market may lead to a drain of foreign exchanges.
Another one is the huge domestic demand for hard currency which
could lead to fluctuations on the foreign exchange black market.
</P>
<P>
"Mutual funds targeting the B-share market could be launched on
the domestic capital market," said Tang Hao, vice president of
China Securities' international department.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the total investment volume could be settled while
fluctuations would be avoided on the black market.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he believes it is possible that the government takes
steps to attract funds -- both from overseas and at home -- to
further boost market performance.
</P>
<P>
"If the market remains bearish, it will lose most of its
attraction after the second board of the Hong Kong stock market,
targeting small high-tech firms, opens in the last quarter of this
year," Tang was quoted as saying by the China Daily.

<HEADLINE> China to Achieve Balance of International Payments: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to realize a balance of
international payments this year despite a shrinking trading
surplus and a falling overseas investment influx, the China Daily
Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Although China's exports declined 4.6 percent during the first
half of the year and imports grew 16.6 percent, China still reaped
a trade surplus of eight billion US dollars. The surplus figure
for the same period last year was at 22.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted experts as saying that the prospects for
China's exports for the second half of the year were looking
slightly brighter, and that the country will enjoy trade surplus
for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Song Guoqing, chief economist of the China's Securities
Executive Council, told the weekly that trade surplus of the year
would amount 10 billion US dollars. The surplus figure for last
year was at 43.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted an unidentified official as saying that
while China's foreign investment influx is similar to that of
exports -- the volume is declining, the sheer size is still big
enough to underpin a favorable balance of international payments.
</P>
<P>
The direct overseas investment in the first half of the year
slid 9.2 percent to 18.6 billion US dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that government's unremitting efforts to
increase exports and foreign investment have been and will
continue to be an indispensable positive factor sustaining foreign
exchange influx.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves stood at 147 billion US
dollars by the end of June.

BRASILIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Argentina are
advancing towards an agreement on a common automotive scheme that
is scheduled to be in force next January, said a sector spokesman
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new mechanism will permit "a well-administered market" of
motor vehicles in the region, mainly in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, based on establishing quotas agreed upon by car
makers of the two countries, will take effect during a four-year
period, from 2000 to 2004.
</P>
<P>
The quotas will be expanded gradually until a true regime of
free trade of vehicles is consolidated.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Beats Chile 2-1 To Take Third-place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico ended the Copa America
trip with a 2-1 victory over Chile to win its second straight
third-place in the South American championship in Asuncion,
Paraguay, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mexicans' hero is Miguel Zepeda, whose goal broke the 1-1 tie
with three minutes left and brought Mexico the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely satisfied with what we did," Mexican coach
Miguel Lapuente said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has reached the semifinals in three of its four
appearances in the Copa America. The team defeated Chile, Peru and
Venezuela before losing to Brazil in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico now wants to cease being a guest at the Copa America
and to become a fixture." Lapuente said.
</P>
<P>
The game was surprisingly hard-fought for a consolation match,
with both teams pressing the attack.
</P>
<P>
Chile had an early edge, with Fabian Estay missing high on a
free kick and Zamorano firing on a breakaway that nicked the post.
</P>
<P>
However, Mexico opened the scoring in the 25th minute.
Hernandez fired from the left side and Chile's goalkeeper Ramirez
failed to hold on. The rebound went to Palencia and he tapped it
in.
</P>
<P>
Just before the half, Hernandez nearly scored on another header,
but Ramirez got a hand on it and the ball bounced off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Chile leveled the score in the 80 minutes. Having stolen the
ball, Raul Palacios worked a give-and-go with Jose Luis Sierra and
eluded goalkeeper Jorge Campos to score.
</P>
<P>
Seven minutes later, Zepeda got the game winner.

<HEADLINE> Two Mexicans to Serve Six-month Bans for Doping at Copa America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexican national team players
Raul Lara and Paulo Cesar Chavez were suspended for six months for
testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Copa America soccer
games, the South American confederation said in Asuncion, Paraguay,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ban, considered relatively light, applies only in South
America and does not prevent them from playing for their clubs in
Mexico or on their national team.
</P>
<P>
The definitive sanctions fall to FIFA and CONCACAF, the
confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean.
Those bodies are expected at least to confirm the six-month
suspension and could order a harsher penalty.
</P>
<P>
Lara and Chavez avoided the penalty imposed for a similar
offense on Uruguay's Pablo Bengoechea, who was suspended for two
years in 1989. Until now, that was the only case of doping
registered in the Copa America.
</P>
<P>
Lara and Chavez were suspended when routine tests showed traces
of steroids in their urine after a first-round game with Brazil,
which Mexico lost 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Lara was tested again after the next game, a 3-1 victory over
Venezuela, and again the result was positive, CONMEBOL said.

<HEADLINE> Protests Over Fuel Price Hikes End in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government agreed on
Saturday to freeze fuel prices for a year, ending the two-week-
long large-scale protests staged by some social groups and the
Indians in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
President Jamil Mahuad reached agreement with the protesters
Saturday that fuel prices will be reduced to the June level and be
frozen for a year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement means the end of the protests which started on
July 5 and also the end of the state of national emergency imposed
by the government.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices had increased 13.1 percent on average since July 1.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning Mahuad also resolved the last
differences he had with the Indians and signed the covenant with
this group.
</P>
<P>
The Indians, coming from all over Ecuador, forced the
government to establish a calendar for the liberalization of bank
accounts which were partially frozen last March, on Mahuad's
orders.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to investigate the withdrawals of huge
sums of money before the account freeze was ordered, and to
publish auditor's reports on the status of the banking system.

<HEADLINE> IMF Offers Loan to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide Colombia with a loan of 3 billion
U.S. dollars to back its economy, reports here quoted IMF
President Michel Camdessus as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who made the announcement through a tele-conference
during the Meeting for Productivity and Competitiveness in
Colombia's Caribbean port of Cartagena, described the credit as
the launching pad for the country's government economic program.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the loan, the most important support measure
offered recently by the IMF to the Andean country, will contribute
to the revitalization process of Colombia's economy, and
constitute "an indispensable complement for its peace process."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB)
also announced similar backing to promote confidence for the peace
talks, to be resumed next Monday with the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
Colombia, facing its worst economic slump for decades, has
already adopted several austerity measures, including
recapitalizing state banks and cutting public spending to reduce
the 1999 fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of the gross domestic
product.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake
registering 5.4 on the Richter scale shook the central region of
Colombia on Saturday, causing no serious damage, said a Colombian
Seismological Institute spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, which also affected the Colombian capital but with
less intensity, occurred at 07:21 local time, with its epicenter
located in the Sativasur village in the south of the Boyaca
department.
</P>
<P>
Damage and cracking were reported in five houses, the church, a
school and a hospital in the village, but nobody was hurt because
the residents ran out of their houses at the moment of the quake
and gathered at safe places.
</P>
<P>
Located on the seismic strip, Sativasur was shaken on January
25 by a quake of six on the Richter scale that left 1,000 persons
killed and 4,000 injured.

<HEADLINE> Teenage Smokers Increasing Dramatically in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Teenage smoking has risen
dramatically in New Zealand this decade, according to two
recently-released studies.
</P>
<P>
Otago University researcher Tony Reeder found in his study that
15 percent of 5,000 Wellington fourth formers questioned in 1997
about their smoking habits lit up daily compared with eight
percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the proportion of fourth-formers who had
smoked in the month before being questioned had jumped from 18
percent to 28 percent. Simultaneously, disapproval rates about
smoking dropped among survey participants.
</P>
<P>
The second survey, by an anti-smoking group, revealed that 38
percent of fourth-formers smoked in 1998 compared with 31 percent
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Results from the studies have led New Zealand health groups to
push for an anti-smoking campaign aimed at teenagers and have also
raised doubts about the effectiveness of the Smokefree
Environments Act.
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the Act, due to be debated in the Parliament in
10 days, would designate schools smoke free, require cigarettes to
be kept out of sight in shops, and impose harsher punishment on
the retailers who sell cigarettes to children.

<HEADLINE> NZ Govt Backed in Challenge against US Lamb Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Meat New Zealand Chairman John
Acland
said New Zealand farmers, meat processors and exporters have
"every right
to be angry at" U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to impose
tariffs
on all lamb imports.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of "Meat Matters" by Meat NZ, Chairman
Acland said
his board is backing the New Zealand Government "all the way in
any
challenge it makes to the World Trade Organization (WTO)" on what
he
described as this "unacceptable U.S. decision."
</P>
<P>
The decision recently announced by President Clinton is to levy
a
tariff of nine percent on lamb imports from July 22, up to the
volume
imported in 1998 with the rate falling to six percent in the
second year
and reducing to three percent in the third year of the three-year

arrangement. Outside the quota, according to the decision, a
tariff of 40
percent will be imposed in the first year, reducing to 32 percent
and 24
percent in years two and three.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and Australia are the major lamb suppliers to the
U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
Over the three years, the U.S. decision "will levy a gratuitous
tax of
some 24 million NZ dollars" (about 13 million U.S. dollars) on New

Zealand sheep farmers and exporters, Acland said.
</P>
<P>
"I am shattered by this decision. It flies in the face of
statements
by the President and other members of his Administration that the
United
States is dedicated to 'free and fair' trade. It can only
undermine the
credibility of President Clinton's call to other trading nations
to join
in a new round of multilateral negotiations late this year," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ngeny Roars Second Best Result, But Misses Oldest Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Noah Ngeny ran the second-
fastest 1,000 meters in the history, missing Sebastian Coe's world
record narrowly in the Nice Athletics Grand Prix meeting in Nice,
France, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny roared round the track in two minutes 12.66 seconds, just
shy of Coe's time of 2:12.18 set 18 years ago in Oslo and the
oldest individual record in the athletics record books.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Kenyan, who has run the three fastest 1,500
meters times this season and bettered Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj
to the mile world record two weeks ago in Rome, was paced by
fellow David Kiptoo through much of the race.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's Noureddine Morceli, Olympic 1,500 meters champion and
2,000 meters world record holder, was also expected to challenge
the mark but the former world record holder in the 1,500, mile and
3,000 failed to appear on the start line.
</P>
<P>
Olympic 800 and 1,500 gold medallist Svetlana Masterkova of
Russia attempted to break her own record in the women's 1,000
meters but fell more than two seconds short, clocking 2:32.18
despite being pushed by Mozambique's Maria Mutola.
</P>
<P>
The meeting got off to a blistering start, with Ionela Tirlea
of Romania recording the second-best time this season in the 400
meters hurdles, clocking 53.44 to edge out world champion Nezha
Bidouane of Morocco 53.48.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Leonard Myles-Mills won the men's 100 meters in 10.12
seconds, Britain's Mark Richardson the men's 400 in 44.98 and
Sevatheda Fynes of Bahamas took the women's 200 title in 22.32.
Kenyan Paul Kosgei took the 3,000 meters steeplechase in a slow 8:

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Manager Says Anelka Talks Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has insisted negotiations to
sell striker Nicolas Anelka to Lazio are still on.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Italian club's president Sergio Cragnotti said the
deal was "definitively" off, and described the Premiership club as
"stubborn in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger insisted: "All I can tell you is that talks are
going on.
</P>
<P>
"I'm as fed up about this as anyone else because I didn't want
to lose him but we've been forced to sell."
</P>
<P>
Wenger wants the long-running affair to come to an end soon so
he can replace the forward.
</P>
<P>
The Gunners boss confirmed that he is looking for two new
strikers, but denied an immediate interest in Everton star Francis
Jeffers.
</P>
<P>
"I rate him very highly but I feel he needs more experience in
the Premiership before a judgment can be made," said Wenger.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking for two strikers, but I'm not close to securing
anyone yet. If you find two, then give me a call," added the
Frenchman.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras and Alex O'Brien
fought off a furious charge by the Australian duo of Mark
Woodforde and Sandon Stolle to pull out a 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3
victory today in the doubles of the Davis Cup in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cut Australia's lead to 2-1 in the best-of-five series
heading into Sunday's reverse singles.
</P>
<P>
The win also fuels speculation on whether U.S. captain Tom
Gullikson will replace Todd Martin with Sampras in the first match
on Sunday against world No. 2 Patrick Rafter. Jim Courier and
teenager Lleyton Hewitt will square off in the fifth match.
</P>
<P>
Despite playing in his first Davis Cup doubles since,Sampras
was effective today.
</P>
<P>
Billed as the "Rivalry for the Ages," the U.S. and Australia
are meeting for the 45th time, with the U.S. holding a 25-19 edge,
including 14-8 on American soil. The U.S. has won a record 31
Davis Cup titles and Australia is second with 26.
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinal matchups, Slovakia and Switzerland stayed
alive with doubles wins today.
