Aid groups say many Chinese flood victims at risk of diseases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Tens of thousands of victims of China's
devastating summer floods are living in makeshift shelters and
losing free access to medical care as clinics close, an aid group
reported Friday.
	   Doctors Without Borders said officials in Hunan and Hubei
provinces in south-central China could not proceed with
vaccinations against typhoid and other diseases prevalent in the
area because emergency government-run clinics were closing due to
lack of funds.
	   At least 3,656 people were killed in the unusually severe floods
that ravaged much of southern and northeastern China this summer.
	   In hard-hit areas of Hunan, people were still living in
temporary shelters made of plastic sheets and salvaged materials as
far as the eye could see on some dikes because they had no money to
rebuild, said Odilon Couzin, a spokesman from the group.
	   Many others were moving their lean-tos from the dikes and
rebuilding them on the sites of their ruined houses, he said.
	   Respiratory diseases were on the rise as temperatures dropped,
and outbreaks of pneumonia were likely unless more aid arrives,
said a statement from Doctors Without Borders, an international
humanitarian organization that is providing medicines, blankets and
other supplies to the flood zones.
	   Many families have only one blanket and are living on a minimal
diet of mostly rice, the group reported.
	   Although there were no reports of epidemics, some areas had many
cases of dysentery caused by contaminated water, said Jim
Robertson, a Red Cross representative based in Beijing.
	   In the northeast, where winter temperatures drop far below zero,
people in some villages were living in rough temporary shelters,
and the government and Red Cross were rushing to build better
temporary or permanent homes to protect them from the cold,
Robertson said.
	   The Chinese government and some village governments are trying
to move people into temporary underground houses built in pits with
sandbags around the edges and covered by wooden roofs piled with
earth or turf.
	   Robertson said the underground houses, which were common in the
1950s and 1960s, provided adequate insulation and were heated with
wood or dung fires that heat pipes under sleeping areas.
	   The Chinese Red Cross was continuing to send food and materials
to purify water and improve sanitation in the flood zones in order
to prevent diseases, he said.

Antarctic drilling reaches back 33-million years into past
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ An Antarctic drilling program
into the undersea shelf off the frozen continent has reached back
about 33-million years, and recovered dozens of previously unknown
sea life forms, scientists said Friday.
	   The six-nation project ended drilling for the spring season at
2,047 feet (624 meters) below the sea floor on Wednesday, at Cape
Roberts on the Antarctic coastline, 85 miles (140 kilometers) from
New Zealand's Scott Base and the U.S. McMurdo Station on McMurdo
Sound.
	   Drilling the Antarctic seabed deposits is part of a study of
past climatic change.
	   Scientists believe rock cores from 1,500 feet (500 meters) below
the seabed could unlock the history of the Antarctic's climate and
offer clues to global warming.
	   They also believe that studying earlier Antarctic warm spells
may help them predict what global warming may do to the world's ice
and sea levels.
	   Prof. Peter Barrett, chief scientist of the project, said the
recovered core samples would date the undersea sediment layers by
using microfossils, volcanic ash layers, isotope chemistry of
shells and reversals of the earth's magnetic field to link with ice
sheet, sea level and climate changes.
	   ``The cores ... include an enormous variety of microfossils,
which are used both to date the strata and provide data on the
environment of the deposit,'' said Barrett, a geologist at
Wellington's Victoria University.
	   ``Many new (life) forms are being found. Most are expected to
represent new species and ... will be useful for dating other cores
from around the Antarctic region.''
	   The New Zealand dollars 9 million (U.S. dlrs 5 million) joint
venture drilling program was earlier expected to reach as far back
as 40 to 60 million years this summer.
	   Drilling last year yielded material going back 22 million years,
including 32 different shellfish fossils and 15 previously unknown
species of algae, which scientists said indicate the Ross Sea off
Antarctica was several degrees warmer 1.2 million to 1.8 million
years ago.
	   Scientific institutions around the world are analyzing and
describing the seabed core as it is recovered by the drilling team.
Nations involved in the project are New Zealand, Australia,
Britain, Germany, Italy and the United States.
	   Earlier this month the scientists working on the core found up
to four huge volcanic eruptions rocked Antarctica about 25 million
years ago, spewing ash as far as 40 miles (70 kilometers) into the
atmosphere.
	   Barrett said a further seabed hole costing New Zealand dlrs 2.8
million (U.S. dlrs 1.5 million) will be drilled nearby in the
Antarctic spring (October-November), ``taking the story of
Antarctic climate ... back another 10 or even 20 million years.''

Philippine stocks rise sharply on good 3rd quarter economic data;
</HEADLINE>
index up 2.8 percent

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply
Friday, shaking off earlier lethargy after the release of
better-than-expected third quarter economic data, traders said.
	   The Philippine economy, in terms of gross national product,
expanded in the third quarter by 0.8 percent from a year earlier,
defying the pessimistic outlook of most economists. However, gross
domestic product, which excludes money sent home by millions of
overseas Filipino workers, shrank 0.1 percent.
	   The data put GNP growth at 0.8 percent for the first nine
months, and gross domestic product growth at 0.2 percent.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks soared
54.43 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,975.36, its highest since June 2
this year. The index fell 37.61 points Thursday.
	   The broader All Shares Index rose 13.64 points to 627.28 after a
6.63-point retreat Thursday. Gainers beat losers 86 to 26, while 42
issues were unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. and Metro Pacific Corp.,
which both retreated after Metro Pacific's parent, First Pacific
Co. of Hong Kong, announced its long-awaited takeover of PLDT
earlier this week, were the day's most active stocks.
	   PLDT rose 30 pesos to 1,030 pesos, while Metro Pacific gained 8
centavos to 1.98 pesos.
	   Cilette Liboro, research head of Orion Squire Securities, said
the better-than-expected economic data should push the market index
beyond its immediate resistance of 2,000 points, a level it hasn't
touched since May.
	   ``It appears the economy has already bottomed out, and we should
see some modest recovery in the first half,'' she said.
	   ING Barings economist Joey Cuyegkeng said the economic data
caught many analysts by surprise and proved the economy's
resiliency. He said it should further enhance investor confidence,
which has improved in recent months with developments overseas such
as cuts in U.S. interest rates.
	   In currency trading, the peso was slightly lower against the
dollar in quiet midday trading, with participants staying sidelined
because of shortened trading hours in the United States later
Friday, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.542 pesos in morning trading, up from
Thursday's average of 39.462 pesos.
	   Traders said a lack of market-moving news kept the dollar within
an extremely thin range.
	   The currency market largely ignored the release of economic
growth data, traders said.

	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Greg Adams doubled his season scoring in one game
with two goals and one assist as the Phoenix Coyotes kept three
NHL-best streaks alive by beating the New Jersey Devils 3-2
Thursday night.
	   Rick Tocchet had a goal and two assists for Phoenix, which tied
its franchise record by remaining unbeaten for the 13th straight
game (11-0-2). The Coyotes' only other 13-game unbeaten string ran
from March 8-April 7, 1985, when the former Winnipeg Jets went
10-0-3.
	   The Coyotes also played their 16th consecutive game without
giving up three goals, two shy of the NHL record set by the 1958-59
Montreal Canadiens, and won their seventh in a row, coming within
two games of another franchise mark set in 1985.
	   Coyotes backup Jimmy Waite allowed two goals to Petr Sykora in
the third period but made 27 saves to up his record to 5-0-1.
 &UR; Senators 4, Islanders 1 &QC; 
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Alexei Yashin had one goal and two assists
as Ottawa tied a franchise record with its fourth consecutive
victory.
	   Vaclav Prospal and Lance Pitlick also scored and Shaun Van Allen
had an empty-net goal for the Senators, who are unbeaten in five
games and 7-3-3 in their last 13. Shawn McEachern added three
assists.
	   Scott Lachance scored the only goal for the Islanders, spoiling
goaltender Damian Rhodes's shutout bid on a power play with 6:09
left in the game.

Questions raised over payout to Hong Kong airport boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ As Hong Kong officials try to figure out who to
blame for the disastrous opening of their new airport, politicians
are raising questions about a big payment soon due to its chief
executive, it was reported Friday.
	   Hong Kong agreed to give Hank Townsend, the boss of the Airport
Authority, a one-time ``gratuity'' payment of 2.5 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 320,000) after his contract expires on Monday.
	   Townsend will be out of the job after that, and the pending
payment drew fire from legislators who wonder whether the cash
should be frozen until several inquiries into the airport debacle
are concluded, according to the South China Morning Post.
	   ``It's still arguable whether Dr. Townsend can be regarded as
having completed his job, not to mention to the board's
satisfaction,'' Democrat legislator Cheung Man-kwong was quoted as
saying. ``Who is going to bear the responsibility if it is decided
he is the one to blame?''
	   Cheung accused the Airport Authority of ``blatant contempt'' for
the ongoing investigations.
	   But an Airport Authority board member, Ho Sai-chu, said
Townsend's contract requires the payment.
	   ``If he had made a big mistake and was sacked before the term
expired, we could consider not paying the gratuity to him,'' Ho
said. ``But we do not see any strong evidence we can fire him. His
term will expire in a few days, so we shall pay him according to
what is promised in the contract.''
	   Townsend, a former International Bechtel Inc. engineer, recently
testified to lawmakers that he could have been more forthcoming
about potential problems when Chek Lap Kok Airport opened on July
6.
	   Government officials have griped that since they weren't fully
informed, they proceeded with a gala opening of the airport that
humiliated Hong Kong as computer breakdowns and systems problems
crippled both passenger and cargo services.

South Africans begin first-ever voter registration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africans lined up to
register Friday for 1999 elections in the country's first attempt
to produce a complete voter roll.
	   Election officials said most registration stations appeared to
be ready for the 7 a.m. (0500 gmt) start, but SABC state television
and radio reported some problems, such as venues not yet open and
help lines on venues going unanswered.
	   Registration was moving forward in five northern provinces,
representing about half the 25 million eligible voters, and
continues through the weekend. The other four provinces, in the
south, hold registration Dec. 4-6.
	   The weeks leading up to the registration have been marked by
confusion and controversy, with mainly white opposition parties
saying millions of people were being denied the right to register
because they did not have the right identity card.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission acknowledged it wasn't
ready and announced just this week it had to stagger the
registration.
	   South Africans went directly to the polls during 1994's first
all-race elections, which ended apartheid. The new constitution
required the creation of a comprehensive voter roll.
	   Elections are likely to take place next May, though no date has
been set.

Report: Washington may aid North Korea if it opens up suspected
</HEADLINE>
site

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The United States may provide North
Korea with economic aid if the communist state allows inspection of
a suspect underground nuclear site, a South Korean newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, the Clinton
administration's point man on North Korea, discussed such an
appeasement approach with other U.S. government experts earlier
this week, said the Kukmin Daily, quoting an unidentified
diplomatic source.
	   The report said the United States would broach that idea to
North Korea when both sides meet in New York and Washington in
early December to address American concerns about the underground
site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons.
	   Officials at Seoul's Foreign Ministry were unable to confirm or
deny the report.
	   In discussions earlier this month in Pyongyang, North Korea
rejected a U.S. request for unconditional access to the site,
arguing that the facility is not nuclear-related.
	   North Korea said, however, that it would allow a one-time
inspection of the site if the United States compensates for its
``groundless'' accusations concerning the facility.
	   American officials turned down a North Korean demand for dlrs
300 million for the right to inspect the project, located in a
mountainside at Kumchang-ri, 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of
Yongbyon.
	   The Kukmin said although the U.S. policy against financial
compensation for such inspections remained unchanged, Washington
was considering an alternative of providing humanitarian aid
through the U.N. Development Program.
	   ``The idea is emerging as a persuasive option,'' Kukmin quoted
its source as saying. ``The aid will be nothing like the direct
financial compensation that North Korea demands.''
	   The U.N. Development Program is spearheading an international
effort to provide technical and other assistance to help North
Korea revive its devastated agricultural and other economic
sectors.
	   The U.S. State Department says any North Korean attempt to
develop nuclear weapons would violate a 1994 agreement between the
two countries.
	   Under the 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspect nuclear weapons program. In return,
it will get two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion plus
substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.

Four killed in Turkish bus explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A bomb exploded on a passenger bus in the
early hours of Friday, killing four passengers and injuring 20
others, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The bomb, though to be a time-controlled device, was placed in
the luggage department of the bus. It went off near the city of
Kirikkale, some 76 kilometers (48 miles) east of Ankara. The bus
was on its way to Ankara from Sivas, 441 kilometers (276 miles)
east.
	   Anatolia said most of the passengers were relatives of a group
of suspected pro-Islamic militants who were detained last month for
allegedly plotting an attack on the mausoleum of modern and secular
Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, during a crowded ceremony.
	   They were reportedly on their way to visit the detained in an
Ankara prison.
	   There was no immediate claims of responsibility.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut
off a trip to Europe and planned to fly home from London Friday,
after two more Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon, Israel
radio reported.
	   The two soldiers, on patrol in South Lebanon, died Thursday when
a two bombs went off under their armored vehicles, according to the
Israeli army spokesman. Two other soldiers were killed in a Lebanon
bomb blast Wednesday. Since the beginning of the year, 23 Israelis
have been killed in Lebanon.
	   The Iran-backed Hezbollah guerrillas took responsibility for the
attacks, according to radio reports.
	   An Israeli cabinet minister and the chairman of the powerful
parliamentary security committee called on Israel to attack Beirut
and destroy infrastructure there in response to the attacks.
	   Netanyahu planned to visit Spain after winding up talks in
London, but sent a message of regrets to his Spanish counterpart,
canceling his trip to Madrid.
	   Netanyahu is to convene high-level consultations about Israel's
options in Lebanon, as the debate over whether Israel's army should
be there at all escalates here.
	   Avigdor Kahalani, the Israeli public security minister, called
on Israel to attack Beirut and knock out electricity and water
service there. ``For every Israeli (Israeli) soldier killed there,
there must be darkness in Beirut,'' he told the Israel army radio.
	   Agreeing, Uzi Landau, the chairman of the Israeli parliament's
security committee, said Israel must change the ``rules of the
game'' before pulling its soldiers out of Lebanon. ``We have talked
enough about what we can do,'' he told Israel TV's Second Channel.
``If we have the ability to strike, why not now?'' He warned that
if Israel appears to pull out because of Hezbollah attacks, Israel
will face more terrorism in the future.
	   The Israeli army patrols a self-proclaimed ``security zone'' ten
to 15 kilometers (six to nine miles) wide in Lebanese territory,
across the Israeli border. The Israelis say the purpose is the keep
Hezbollah guerrillas away from Israeli border villages.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut
off a trip to Europe and planned to fly home from London Friday,
after two more Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon, Israel
radio reported.
	   The two soldiers, on patrol in South Lebanon, died Thursday when
a two bombs went off under their armored vehicles, according to the
Israeli army spokesman. Two other soldiers were killed in a Lebanon
bomb blast Wednesday. Since the beginning of the year, 23 Israelis
have been killed in Lebanon.
	   The Iran-backed Hezbollah guerrillas took responsibility for the
attacks, according to radio reports.
	   An Israeli cabinet minister and the chairman of the powerful
parliamentary security committee called on Israel to attack Beirut
and destroy infrastructure there in response to the attacks.
	   Netanyahu planned to visit Spain after winding up talks in
London, but sent a message of regrets to his Spanish counterpart,
canceling his trip to Madrid.
	   Netanyahu is to convene high-level consultations about Israel's
options in Lebanon, as the debate over whether Israel's army should
be there at all escalates here.
	   Avigdor Kahalani, the Israeli public security minister, called
on Israel to attack Beirut and knock out electricity and water
service there. ``For every (Israeli) soldier killed there, there
must be darkness in Beirut,'' he told the Israel army radio.
	   Agreeing, Uzi Landau, the chairman of the Israeli parliament's
security committee, said Israel must change the ``rules of the
game'' before pulling its soldiers out of Lebanon. ``We have talked
enough about what we can do,'' he told Israel TV's Second Channel.
``If we have the ability to strike, why not now?'' He warned that
if Israel appears to pull out because of Hezbollah attacks, Israel
will face more terrorism in the future.
	   The Israeli army patrols a self-proclaimed ``security zone'' ten
to 15 kilometers (six to nine miles) wide in Lebanese territory,
across the Israeli border. The Israelis say the purpose is the keep
Hezbollah guerrillas away from Israeli border villages.
	   Hezbollah is trying to drive the Israelis out, using guerrilla

Singapore banks holding bad regional loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore banks shouldered bad regional debt
equaling about 18 percent of their total loans to five key Asian
countries hit by the economic crisis, government statistics said
Friday.
	   Loans by Singapore's six domestic banks in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines totaled 35.8 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 21.7 billion) at the end of the third
quarter, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
	   Of these, non-performing loans reached 6 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 3.6 billion), or 17.8 percent of their total loans in
the five countries, MAS said on its web site.
	   The de facto central bank announced in October that it would
start releasing such data on a quarterly basis via the Internet as
part of recent measures to make Singapore's financial sector more
transparent.
	   Singapore banks have been forced to write off a large amount of
bad debt in the region over the past year, and sour domestic loans
have also been increasing.
	   ``In line with the contracting Singapore economy, the banks'
(non-performing loans) are showing a rising trend, but not at an
alarming rate,'' said Violet Soh, head of research at Fraser-AMMB
Research in the local brokerage's daily report.
	   The six local banking groups are Development Bank of Singapore,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., United Overseas Bank, Overseas Union
Bank, and merger partners Keppel Bank and Tat Lee Bank.
	   Their total non-performing loans amounted to 6.6 percent of all
debt at the end of September, compared with 5 percent at the end of
June. Similar figures for the level of bad regional loans at the
end of the second quarter were unavailable.

Japanese leader restates pledge to engineer economic recovery
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Addressing the opening of an extraordinary session
of Parliament, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Friday
reiterated a pledge to put his nation's economy back on track for
growth within two years.
	   Passage of a new budget, the third supplementary appropriation
measure this year, was expected to top the agenda during the 18-day
session. The government has come under increasing pressure both at
home and abroad to stop the economy from shrinking for a third
consecutive year.
	   ``Our paramount issue is setting the groundwork for a more
healthy functioning of the financial system and resuscitating the
economy,'' Obuchi said, restating a commitment made at the outset
of his four-month-old government.
	   The centerpiece of the budget bill is a record 24 trillion yen
(dlrs 196 billion) stimulus spending package announced earlier this
month after the conclusion of a regular session of Parliament in
late October.
	   The package surpasses a 17 trillion yen (dlrs 139 billion) plan
the government released in April and brings the total amount Tokyo
has spent on stimulus since 1992 to 100 trillion yen (dlrs 815
billion).
	   Obuchi said the spending plan will help create one million new
jobs.
	   Another issue likely to be taken up by lawmakers is a proposed
revision of a law approved last year which ties the government's
hands by imposing tough fiscal discipline.
	   The Obuchi administration wants to relax the law so that it can
more easily issue bonds for generating funds to stimulate the
economy.
	   Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party hopes to avoid the
wrenching debate which characterized the last session of Parliament
when opposition parties held up passage of a number of key bills.
	   The Liberal Democrats, which control the lower house but lack a
majority in the upper house, have forged an alliance with the
minority Liberal Party.
	   The LDP is betting that it can marginalize opposition forces in
the upper house with the support of its minority partner and
unaligned independents.

Hong Kong seizes U.S. dlrs 129,000 worth of pirated discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials said Friday they had raided
an unlicensed compact disc operation, seizing 1 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 129,000 million) worth of pirated discs.
	   Ten people were arrested when customs officers raided 10 shops
in a busy shopping mall in Hong Kong's Mongkok district late
Thursday, seizing more than 3,900 VCDs, 30,000 CD-ROMs, and 2,000
CDs.
	   They also seized 23,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,900)
worth of shop equipment. The origin of the pirated discs is still
under investigation.
	   Those arrested _ all between the ages of 22 to 62 _ were
released on bail of up to 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1,300).
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed the territory on a watch list of
countries suspected of copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in Hong Kong.
	   Last year, customs officials seized 66 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 8.46 million) worth of counterfeit products and arrested
850 suspects.

	   The dollar bought 122.72 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.80
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late
London level of 122.25 yen overnight.
	   U.S. financial markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving
holiday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 138.38 points,
or 0.91 percent, to close at 15,069.39. On Thursday, it rose 134.30
points, or 0.89 percent.
	   The Tokyo foreign exchange market was moved mostly by interbank
transactions as many foreign dealers in Japan and players based in
the U.S. were absent due to Thanksgiving, traders said.
	   But the thin trading exacerbated the dollar's gains, allowing it
to hit a 10-day high of 122.80 yen in interday trading, they said.
	   Local media reports that Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa plans
to leave the Cabinet and resign from his post as head of a major
ruling party faction were shrugged off by traders.
	   ``The market was expecting it,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury
manager at Commerzbank. ``And at this point it doesn't matter who
takes his place as the rails have already been laid for the
stability of the financial system.''
	   The reports of Finance Minister Miyazawa's impending departure
also had little impact on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Share prices drifted into positive territory for much of the
afternoon before dropping just ahead of the close.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 6.24 points, or 0.54
percent, to 1,158.35. The TOPIX closed up 10.91 points, or 0.47
percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.075 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.035 percent,
driving its price down to 106.27 yen from 106.64 yen.

Singapore gets another taste of smoke haze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore suffered an unexpected bout of haze
on Friday when winds swept smoke from forest fires in neighboring
Indonesia over the city-state for the first time in months.
	   The pollution standards index _ which measures smoke haze and
other air pollutants _ reached the ``moderate'' range in the
morning.
	   By noon, the index climbed to 60. Any reading above 100 is
considered unhealthy, and health officials recommend curtailed
outdoor activity for school children and asthmatics.
	   Wong Teo Suan, deputy director of Singapore's Meteorological
Service, said the haze was from fires, probably from land-clearing,
on the nearby Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is experiencing
drier weather.
	   A change in wind direction is sending ``smoke haze from the
forest fires to be blown over Singapore,'' said Wong.
	   Visibility had dropped to about five kilometers (3 miles) around
Changi Airport at noon, he said.
	   ``But the fires are actually fairly isolated and we don't expect
them to spread further,'' Wong added. ``Prevailing winds are likely
to change course in the next few days too.''
	   The regional haze problem had subsided since April as El Nino _
which caused unusually dry conditions that exacerbated the spread
of annual forest fires _ eased and was replaced by wetter weather.

Philippines forbids entry of recruiters for fictitious country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine authorities have banned 15
foreigners from entering the country on suspicion of links to a
group that recruited people for jobs in a fictitious country, an
official said Friday.
	   Raymond Salting, spokesman of the Bureau of Immigration, said
the names of the 15 foreigners were identified during the
questioning of three other members of the group who were arrested
earlier this month in raids in Olongapo City, west of Manila.
	   Those banned include David Korem, an American and the alleged
founder of the fictitious South Pacific country, the Dominion of
Melchizedek, and John Patrick Gillespie, an Australian who is said
to be the dominion's governor and foreign affairs minister, Salting
said.
	   Gillespie is believed to be in the Philippines and a search for
him has begun, Salting said. Two of Gillespie's relatives,
identified as deputy governors, were also on the list.
	   Also banned were Robin Tan of Singapore, Isoa Gavidi of Fiji and
Walter Chen of Taiwan. The nationalities of the other foreigners
are still being verified, Salting said.
	   Immigration agents discovered the group's existence following
complaints from victims, he said. The group has reportedly
victimized hundreds of Chinese and Bangladeshis who were charged
dlrs 3,500 in ``processing fees'' for ``high-paying'' jobs in the
dominion.
	   So far, Philippine authorities have arrested Chew Chin Yee of
Malaysian, Stuart Ronald Mason-Parker of Britain, and Dennis Oakley
of Australia for alleged links to the group. The three are facing
deportation.
	   Documents confiscated from the three men included application
forms for dominion passports and citizenship.
	   In the Old Testament, Melchizedek was a model priest to whom
Abraham and others paid tithes.

Australia's euthanasia doctor taped patients for legal protection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Dr. Philip Nitschke has a library of
videotapes of people he has helped to die.
	   But unlike Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the American who has been
campaigning for doctor-assisted suicide, Australia's euthanasia
doctor hopes his television footage will save him from prosecution,
not provoke it.
	   ``What Kevorkian has done is incredibly brave, but I don't have
that sort of courage,'' Nitschke said Friday.
	   Nitschke is the only doctor who has legally helped people die
using the world's only euthanasia legislation, the now defunct
Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory.
	   The law was overturned by federal parliament in Match 1997, but
not before Nitschke helped four terminally ill patients
self-administer lethal injections.
	   Nitschke says he still helps terminally ill people who want an
early death, advising them and their families on the types of drugs
available, how to find them and how to use them to achieve an
early, painless death.
	   He won't give detailed accounts of the deaths for fear of
incriminating himself.
	   Nitschke said he has made videotapes of at least 15 people who
have died with his help. Unlike the Kevorkian broadcast, they do
not show the patient's deaths.
	   Kevorkian was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder after
the death of 52-year-old Thomas Youk was shown on national
television.
	   Kevorkian, 70, said he injected Youk with a fatal dose of
potassium chloride on Sept. 17. The retired pathologist, who has
acknowledged attending some 130 assisted suicides since 1990,
challenged prosecutors to settle the debate over assisted suicide.
	   The Australian Medical Association said Friday Nitschke should
be charged.
	   ``If he's got videos, I would be strongly suggesting that he was
committing illegal acts,'' said Gerald Segal, president of the
association's Victorian state branch.
	   Police said someone would have to lodge an official complaint or
present evidence before charges could be laid in any euthanasia
case. So far, no complaint had been lodged, said a spokesman, on
condition of anonymity.
	   Nitschke said his tapes are testimonials by his patients in
which they state clearly that they want to die and want help to do
so.
	   He hopes that if he or other people present at the deaths are
charged with assisting a suicide, the tapes will be evidence that
would help sway a jury. His defense would be that even if a crime
had been committed, on moral grounds there should be no conviction.
	   ``The only time these videos will see the light of day would be
if I was misfortunate enough to find myself in front of a jury,''
Nitschke said.
	   ``I'm not inviting a trial. I don't want to sit in front of a
jury and wonder whether I am going to spend the rest of my life in
jail.''

Referendum results show Albania's constitution approved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)_ Albania's first post-communist
constitution was approved by an overwhelming majority of voters in
last weekend's referendum, official results showed Friday.
	   The constitution, which Western officials have said is necessary
to strengthen the Balkan nation's fragile democracy, now will take
effect once a presidential decree is signed.
	   Approval had been all but guaranteed after the opposition,
locked in a power struggle with the government, urged a boycott of
the vote by its supporters.
	   But the Central Voting Commission's announcement that more than
half of registered voters participated is a good sign for the
government, which had feared a low turnout would weaken its hold on
power and worsen the atmosphere of political uncertainty in
Albania.
	   The Central Voting Commission announced that 93 percent of those
participating in the disputed referendum voted to adopt the
constitution, with a turnout of 50.57 percent.
	   The new constitution outlines civil, democratic and human rights
in the country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in
1991.
	   But it is unlikely to bring to an end to the fierce political
fight between the two biggest parties, the ruling Socialists and
the opposition Democrats.
	   Only few hours after the voting started last Sunday, both sides
claimed victory.
	   The opposition also complained about what it called ``grave
incidents'' at several polling stations, including beatings of its
commissioners.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, accused officials of local
governments supportive of the Democratic Party of manipulating
voter lists by registering dead people and emigrants.
	   Foreign observers considered Sunday's vote an improvement over
last year's parliamentary elections, marred with violence and
irregularities.
	   Due to disagreements over the results coming from local
commissions, the Central Voting Commission announced the final
result early Friday morning a couple of hours after the legal
deadline had expired.
	   Despite the efforts of the Ambassador of the Organisation for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, Daan Everts, the opposition
members of the Central Voting Commission refused to agree on the
final result.
	   The Deputy Chief of the Commission, Pellumb Cela, of the
Democratic Party said the turnout was no more than 39 percent.
	   The leader of the opposition, former President Sali Berisha, has
called for street protests and fresh elections.
	   But recent rallies have not generated the intensity of those in
September that resulted in two days of rioting and forced the
ouster of the prime minister. Only 2,000 people showed up at the
last Democratic Party rally earlier this week.
	   Another opposition rally is planned for Saturday.

Russian economic crisis causes insulin shortage, threatening
</HEADLINE>
diabetics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's insulin stocks are dwindling because of
the country's economic crisis, threatening the health of roughly 2
million diabetics, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``People fear for their lives,'' said Emma Voycheck, the head
diabetes specialist at one Moscow hospital, who said she was
furious that the government would not promise to maintain the
supply of insulin.
	   Since the late 1980s, when the last Soviet insulin plant closed,
Russia has been entirely dependent on imported insulin. That has
been fine with Russian diabetics, who complained about the poor
quality of Soviet insulin.
	   But since the country's economy went into a tailspin in August,
insulin imports have entirely stopped, the Moscow Times reported.
Now, the government estimates that the country has only a one- to
two-month supply left.
	   ``What sort of solution do we see?'' asked Dr. Mikhail
Balabolkin, the chief diabetics physician at the Health Ministry.
``The Finance Ministry or Economics Ministry has to find the money
to buy insulin.''
	   Diabetes, which can cause blindness, kidney failure and death,
is a disease caused by the body's failure to produce enough insulin
or to process it properly. Insulin is the hormone needed for cells
to convert sugar into energy.
	   While some diabetics can control the disease through diet, many
others need to take daily injections of manufactured insulin. The
insulin produced in the Soviet Union was made from animal hormones,
whereas Western companies produce genetically engineered human
insulin.
	   Most insulin in Russia is purchased by regional governments,
which now have no money to buy it, the Moscow Times reported.
Imports of all sorts have been severely curtailed in recent months,
in part because the country's banking crisis has made it almost
impossible to process payments.

Mbangwa strikes twice as Pakistan scores 109 for three

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwean medium fast Mpumelelo
Mbangwa struck twice to restrict Pakistan to 109 for three at lunch
on the first day of the first cricket Test Friday.
	   After Pakistan was sent in to bat on a green-top Arbab Niaz
Stadium wicket, Mbangwa bowled an impressive nine overs and took
two wickets for just 13 runs.
	   At lunch, Ijaz Ahmed was batting on 27 which featured five fours
while Yousuf Youhanna was unbeaten on 7.
	   Mbangwa, 22-year-old right-arm seamer, removed Pakistan skipper
Aamir Sohail (15) off his very first ball of the match when
wicketkeeper Andy Flower took a splendid diving catch in front of
first slip.
	   He then had the prize wicket of burly Inzamamul Haq, who hit
three fours in Neil Johnson's one over, before falling leg before
after scoring 19 off 25 balls.
	   Between Mbangwa's two wickets, Neil Johnson uprooted Saeed Anwar
(36) off stump off a big gap when the left-hander attempted to play
an off drive.
	   Pakistan has packed its line-up with seamers that included Wasim
Akram, Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and Azhar Mahmood with leg-spinner
Mushtaq Ahmed preferred over off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq.

Stranded ship breaks through ice, delivers fuel to northeast
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Finnish tanker that was stranded by thick ice
has finally reached a remote region in northeast Russia to deliver
badly needed fuel supplies, news reports said Friday.
	   The tanker Uikku, carrying 13,000 tons of diesel fuel to be used
at a power station, arrived Thursday night in the port of Pevek,
part of the Chukotka peninsula that juts out toward Alaska.
	   The tanker was supposed to arrive Nov. 18, but had stalled
behind the Sovietsky Soyuz, a nuclear-powered ice breaking ship
that had been unable to cut through the ice earlier this week.
	   Russia's financial crisis has disrupted shipping schedules, and
many isolated northern regions have not received a full allotment
of winter supplies.
	   Many areas are already running short on fuel, though the worst
winter weather has yet to arrive. There are also concerns that food
shortages could arise in some regions, though supplies are adequate
for now.

Referendum results show Albania's constitution approved

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)_ Albania's first post-communist
constitution was approved by an overwhelming majority of voters in
last weekend's referendum, official results showed Friday.
	   The constitution, which Western officials have said is necessary
to strengthen the Balkan nation's fragile democracy, now will take
effect once a presidential decree is signed.
	   Approval had been all but guaranteed after the opposition,
locked in a power struggle with the government, urged a boycott of
the vote by its supporters.
	   But the Central Voting Commission's announcement that more than
half of registered voters participated is a good sign for the
government, which had feared a low turnout would weaken its hold on
power and worsen the atmosphere of political uncertainty in
Albania.
	   The Central Voting Commission announced that 93 percent of those
participating in the disputed referendum voted to adopt the
constitution, with a turnout of 50.57 percent.
	   The new constitution outlines civil, democratic and human rights
in the country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in
1991.

Prosecution resumes attack on Anwar's character

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with witness testimony under cross-examination.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian dissident on trial
on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct grabbed and waved
the photograph presented as evidence Friday to show it merely
captured three people looking into the camera.
	   Prosecutors entered a photograph of ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim and one of his alleged mistresses, the wife of his
secretary, as evidence in the trial, now in its 15th day.
	   Anwar says he is innocent of all charges, which he says are part
of a conspiracy by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to unseat his
former protege because Anwar was becoming too popular.
	   Anwar has been accused of abusing his powers to force police to
arrest and obtain retractions from those who had accused him of
sodomy and adultery.
	   Ummi Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, had
accused Anwar of having sex with her brother's wife.
	   The photograph showed Anwar, Ummi and her brother's wife
together, but they did not look as though they were trying to avoid
being photographed. Anwar held up the photo to the public gallery
and media.
	   Dozens of foreign journalists, diplomats and human rights
activists continue to monitor his trial.
	   Anwar appeared at his arraignment with a black eye and bruises,
causing an international outcry.
	   His firing Sept. 2 and subsequent jailing have led to growing
demands for political reforms in the Southeast Asian country and a
series of anti-government demonstrations.
	   On Friday, Amir Junus, a former deputy chief of police
intelligence, testified that Anwar had forced retractions from Ummi
and Azizan Abu Bakar _ Anwar's former chauffeur, who had accused
Anwar of forcing him to commit sodomy.
	   ``This would indirectly vindicate Anwar's name,'' Amir told the
court. ``If the accused was an ordinary person and not the deputy
prime minister and finance minister, I wouldn't have obeyed the
instructions that were given to me.''
	   Later, Anwar's lawyers asked Amir why he obtained the
retractions, although as a senior police officer, he wasn't
required to take orders from Anwar.
	   ``If the deputy prime minister gives you an order, do you have
to obey it?'' asked Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's nine
defense lawyers. ``Answer me: yes or no?''
	   Amir balked, the replied: ``As a civil servant, I'm forced to
obey directives and orders from him.''
	   The trial resumes Monday with more cross-examination.

Japanese auto exports drop in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sluggish demand in economically troubled Asia
helped push Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses down 7.9
percent in October from the same month a year earlier.
	   It was the sixth straight monthly drop in overall exports, the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said Friday.
	   A total of 358,810 vehicles were exported in October. In value
terms, exports in October dropped 7.2 percent to 6.40 billion yen
(dlrs 52.5 million), compared with 6.89 billion (dlrs 56.6 million)
a year ago
	   Exports were down 14.8 percent from September, when shipments
totaled 421,339 vehicles.
	   By type of vehicle, passenger cars fell 5 percent to 296,585,
trucks tumbled 19.7 percent to 58,914 and buses skidded 15.6
percent to 3,311.
	   ``Falling sales to Asia because of the turmoil in the region
were the biggest reason'' for the drop in overall exports in
October, said Hiroki Mochida, a spokesman at the association.
	   ``The trend hasn't changed,'' he added.
	   Exports to Asia dropped 61.2 percent to 18,356, dropping for the
13th straight month.
	   Overall exports were also hurt by a fall in shipments to the
European Union and Latin America. EU-bound exports dropped 9.2
percent to 80,642 while Latin America-bound shipments tumbled 31.6
percent to 28,469, hurt by the financial crisis in that region.
	   Among Japan's top automakers, Toyota Motor Corp.'s exports
dropped 13 percent to 127,163 amid falling sales to Europe and
Asia. Europe-bound exports were hurt by the high level of shipments
of the new Corolla model to the continent last year.
	   Nissan Motor Co.'s exports were flat at 61,886. Honda Motor
Co.'s exports edged up 1.1 percent to 43,306, helped by continued
demand for the CR-V sports utility model and the Accord in North
America.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s exports rose 1.3 percent to 36,482 and
Mazda Motor Corp.'s exports dropped 15.8 percent to 38,001.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu departure, Netanyahu saying he does not
rule out unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Responding to Israel's growing casualty toll in
southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a
European tour Friday to review his Lebanon policy and was quoted as
saying he no longer rules out a unilateral troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was in London when he received word late Thursday that
two Israeli soldiers were killed by bombs that went off under their
armored vehicles in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu canceled a trip to
Spain and flew home to Israel on Friday.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to seven the number of soldiers killed
in Lebanon over the past 10 days. In all, 23 Israelis have died in
Lebanon this year in clashes with the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group
Hezbollah.
	   Hezbollah, using tactics like ambushes and roadside bombs, wants
to drive Israel out of the zone it established in south Lebanon in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   Lebanon's government insists that Israel pull its soldiers out
of the country without negotiations.
	   Netanyahu plans to convene high-level consultations about
Israel's options in Lebanon on Sunday.
	   Since 1985, Israel's policy has been based on the belief that it
can only pull out its troops as part of a peace agreement with
Lebanon. However, Syria, the main power in Lebanon, is unlikely to
permit such talks until Israel withdraws from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Netanyahu is unwilling to hand back the Golan, thus making a
peace agreement with Syria or Lebanon in the near future unlikely.
	   In recent months, there have been various proposals for a
unilateral Israeli troop withdrawal, including one by Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   Speaking in London, Netanyahu signaled a shift in his position,
saying he is ``not ruling out'' Sharon's plan under which Israel
would withdraw gradually and strike at Hezbollah ``by all means''
should there be an attack on northern Israel.
	   However, Netanyahu also told the Israeli newspaper Yediot
Ahronot that Israel ``will not tuck its tail between its legs and
crawl out without ensuring the security of northern villages.''
	   The rising casualty rate is increasing Israeli popular pressure
to end Israel's occupation of south Lebanon.
	   A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated that
40 percent of Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal, compared to
only 16 percent in February 1997. The survey was conducted among
560 adults and had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.
	   A signed front-page commentary in Yediot Ahronot called on
Netanyahu to ``take an initiative,'' cut through the tangle of
Israel's involvement in Lebanon and order a pullout.
	   Avigdor Kahalani, the Israeli public security minister, called
on Israeli to attack Beirut and knock out electricity and water
service there. ``For every (Israeli) soldier killed there, there
must be darkness in Beirut,'' he told the Israel army radio.
	   Agreeing, Uzi Landau, the chairman of parliament's Defense and
Foreign Affairs Committee, said Israel must change the ``rules of
the game'' before pulling its soldiers out of Lebanon.
	   ``We have talked enough about what we can do,'' he told Israel
TV's Second Channel. ``If we have the ability to strike, why not
now?'' He warned that if Israel appears to pull out because of
Hezbollah attacks, Israel will face more terrorism in the future.
	   Israel's government has accepted U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, calling on Israel to withdraw from South Lebanon,
but the Israelis insist that they must first receive guarantees
that Lebanon's government will keep guerrillas away from the
border.
	   Lebanon refuses, declaring that Resolution 425 demands an
unconditional withdrawal.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu departure, Netanyahu saying he does not
rule out unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Responding to Israel's growing casualty toll in
southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a
European tour Friday to review his Lebanon policy and was quoted as
saying he no longer rules out a unilateral troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was in London when he received word late Thursday that
two Israeli soldiers were killed by bombs that went off under their
armored vehicles in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu canceled a trip to
Spain and flew home to Israel on Friday.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to seven the number of soldiers killed
in Lebanon over the past 10 days. In all, 23 Israelis have died in
Lebanon this year in clashes with the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group
Hezbollah.
	   Hezbollah, using tactics like ambushes and roadside bombs, wants
to drive Israel out of the zone it established in south Lebanon in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   Lebanon's government insists that Israel pull its soldiers out
of the country without negotiations.
	   Netanyahu plans to convene high-level consultations about
Israel's options in Lebanon on Sunday.
	   Since 1985, Israel's policy has been based on the belief that it
can only pull out its troops as part of a peace agreement with
Lebanon. However, Syria, the main power in Lebanon, is unlikely to
permit such talks until Israel withdraws from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Netanyahu is unwilling to hand back the Golan, thus making a
peace agreement with Syria or Lebanon in the near future unlikely.
	   In recent months, there have been various proposals for a
unilateral Israeli troop withdrawal, including one by Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   Speaking in London, Netanyahu signaled a shift in his position,
saying he is ``not ruling out'' Sharon's plan under which Israel
would withdraw gradually and strike at Hezbollah ``by all means''
should there be an attack on northern Israel.
	   The rising casualty rate is increasing Israeli popular pressure
to end Israel's occupation of south Lebanon.
	   A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated that
40 percent of Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal, compared to
only 16 percent in February 1997. The survey was conducted among
560 adults and had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.
	   Avigdor Kahalani, the Israeli public security minister, called
on Israeli to attack Beirut and knock out electricity and water
service there. ``For every (Israeli) soldier killed there, there
must be darkness in Beirut,'' he told the Israel army radio.
	   Israel's government has accepted U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, calling on Israel to withdraw from South Lebanon,
but the Israelis insist that they must first receive guarantees
that Lebanon's government will keep guerrillas away from the
border.
	   Lebanon refuses, declaring that Resolution 425 demands an
unconditional withdrawal.

Air strikes force Congolese rebels to change tactics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NYUNZU, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies
have changed tactics in their nearly four-month war to topple
President Laurent Kabila, moving only by night and resting by day
to avoid government-allied war planes.
	   Zimbabwean fighter jets, including Russian-built MiGs, have
twice in last month bombed Nyunzu and Kabalo, the rebels'
front-line positions about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of
eastern rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   On Friday, two MiG-21s screamed over rebel positions hidden by
tree leaves, but made no attacks.
	   Last weekend, at least 12 civilians were killed when Zimbabwe,
Kabila's main ally, dropped bombs over the Lake Tanganyika port of
Kalemie, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Nyunzu, residents said.
	   The stepped-up air strikes on rebel positions, military convoys
and towns under rebel control appear to signal an escalation in the
Congolese war.
	   Coupled with rainy season, attacks appear to have succeeded in
slowing down the rebels who have captured the eastern half of Congo
since they took up arms Aug. 2.
	   A Rwandan commander, who identified himself only as Joseph, said
the government-allied air strikes had forced his troops to move
supplies and equipment after nightfall and camouflage positions
during the day to avoid being hit from air.
	   ``It's a war. This air activity is not a serious threat, because
they are flying too high, but we have to take precautionary
measures,'' he said in Nyunzu, a small resupply base with a grassy
airstrip in the heart of thick tropical forest.
	   On Friday, a military convoy of vehicles loaded with ammunition
destined for Kabalo, a key point for the rebel offensive in the
copper-rich, southern Katanga Province, snaked through the night
from Nyunzu through dirty, muddy tracks, abandoned hamlets and
defunct railway tracks until it stopped at dawn outside Kabalo.
	   Soldiers parked vehicles away from the road and covered them
with leaves so that they were hidden from war planes patrolling the
cloudless skies.
	   Soldiers rested, listening to noise from the above. Moments
later, two jets swooped low but dropped no bombs before
disappearing.
	   Joseph, who is commanding a unit of Rwandan troops and Congolese
rebels, said he had advance warnings from spies and informers on
when and where enemy planes might next strike.
	   Most Zimbabwean aircraft use Kamina and Manolo air bases, he
said.
	   Most hamlets in northern Katanga, where once-thriving cotton and
copper industries were abandoned during years of misrule under
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, stood eerily empty.
	   A few residents who stayed said their friends and families had
fled to the bush in fear of being killed by the rebels and their
allies, or by the government troops if they come back.
	   But Rwandan commanders dismissed such concerns, saying they were
inviting the population to return without fear of being persecuted.
They blamed Kabila's propaganda for the civilians' flight.

Pavin, Demsey no turkeys on the golf course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ American golfers Corey Pavin and Todd
Demsey celebrated their Thanksgiving holiday in style Friday with
stunning second-round performances at the ANZ Players Championship.
	   Pavin, the 1995 U.S. Open winner, stole countryman Demsey's
thunder with a 66 Friday _ a record for the revamped 6,426-meter
Brisbane River course at Royal Queensland.
	   However, it was the lesser-known Demsey's intriguing four-year
struggle to make the United States tour which made compelling
listening after he carved out a 5-under 68 to share second place
with Australian David McKenzie (68-70), three adrift of Pavin
(69-66) on 138.
	   Demsey suffered the anguish of missing his U.S. PGA tour card by
one shot earlier this week after failing to sink a two-foot putt on
the final hole of his last of six rounds.
	   Demsey led all day until Pavin's smooth putter knocked him from
the top of the leader board.
	   ``I was 13 under with six holes (of the tour school) to go and
10 under got in,'' said Demsey.
	   ``I had a putt on the last hole to get to 11 under. I thought I
had to make it to have any chance and I rolled it two foot past.''
	   Pavin (69-66) goes into the weekend seeking his first victory
since winning the 1996 Colonial Classic.
	   ``It was a very good day,'' said Pavin, who enjoyed a rare eagle
courtesy of a great kick-on bounce into the 495-meter par-5 fifth
green. ``I made some long putts and got all the short ones.''
	   Already out of contention is Englishman David Howell, who won
last week's Australian PGA in Sydney. He missed the cut of 147 by
one stroke after shooting a second-round 76. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai elephant handlers appeared outside
the Indonesian Embassy Friday, riding on their beasts to demand the
return of five elephants.
	   The Thai elephants, renowned as the world's best-trained, were
sent to Indonesian last year at the request of the Indonesian
government to help train Indonesian elephants.
	   Wild elephants in Indonesia had been causing widespread damage
to crops and sometimes killed or injured villagers.
	   But the Indonesian government said earlier this year that it was
unable to pay for the elephants, due to the nation's economic
crisis.
	   The Indonesian Embassy told the nine demonstrators Friday the
elephants will be returned soon, but Thailand must pay the shipping
costs.
	   Protest leader Sompas Meepan said money has been raised.
Bringing the elephants home is expected to cost more than one
million baht (dlrs 28,000), he said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade ministry said Friday that industrial
output in October fell a smaller-than-expected 1.2 percent compared
to the previous month, but that there are few signs of a rebound.
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry characterized
the situation as ``stagnant,'' leaving its assessment unchanged
from last month.
	   ``While some progress in inventory adjustments has been seen,
inventories remain at high levels,'' the ministry said in a report.
``Output continues to stagnate.''
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 1.5
percent decline in seasonally-adjusted production at Japan's
factories and mines. The government had projected a 1.1 percent
drop.
	   In September, output had climbed 2.5 percent on the month.
	   Most major industrial sectors posted declines in October, led by
steelmakers and electric machinery manufacturers.
	   The trade ministry forecast a 1.5 percent decline in industrial
production this month and a 0.6 percent rise in December.
	   It also reported retail sales at major department stores and
supermarkets fell for a sixth consecutive month, dropping 4.8
percent on the year to 1.89 trillion yen (dlrs 15.4 billion) in
October.
	   Sales declined in all categories, with clothing sales hit the
hardest, shrinking 6.9 percent.
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore banks shouldered bad regional debt
equaling about 18 percent of their total loans to five key Asian
countries hit by the economic crisis, government statistics said
Friday.
	   Loans by Singapore's six domestic banks in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines totaled 35.8 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 21.7 billion) at the end of the third
quarter, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
	   Of these, non-performing loans reached 6 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 3.6 billion), or 17.8 percent of their total loans in
the five countries, MAS said on its web site.
	   The de facto central bank announced in October that it would
start releasing such data on a quarterly basis via the Internet as
part of recent measures to make Singapore's financial sector more
transparent.
	   Singapore banks have been forced to write off a large amount of
bad debt in the region over the past year, and sour domestic loans
have also been increasing.
	   ``In line with the contracting Singapore economy, the banks'
(non-performing loans) are showing a rising trend, but not at an
alarming rate,'' said Violet Soh, head of research at Fraser-AMMB
Research in the local brokerage's daily report.
	   The six local banking groups are Development Bank of Singapore,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., United Overseas Bank, Overseas Union
Bank, and merger partners Keppel Bank and Tat Lee Bank.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine economy avoided
recession by expanding slightly in the third quarter of 1998, the
government announced Friday.
	   The gross national product, which measures a country's total
output, grew 0.8 percent from a year earlier, said Felipe Medalla,
the Philippines' economic planning secretary.
	   The GNP had contracted by 0.7 percent in the April-June quarter,
and a second quarter of decline would have officially pushed the
country into recession like many of its troubled Asian neighbors.
	   ``The Philippines escaped recession,'' Medalla said.
	   However, gross domestic product, which does not include the
billions of dollars sent home each year by overseas Filipino
workers, shrank 0.1 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, the
government said.
	   The latest data brings the country's GNP growth in the first
nine months to 0.8 percent year-on-year and GDP growth to 0.2
percent.
	   The GNP was able to expand in the third quarter because of
strong dollar inflows, mainly from overseas Filipinos, Medalla
said.
	   The growth indicates that the Philippines will be able to
achieve the higher end of its recently revised GNP growth target
for 1998, Medalla said, adding that the economy has bottomed out.
	   ``The Philippines is now virtually assured of a positive GNP
growth this year,'' he said.
	   The government, together with the International Monetary Fund,
downgraded the country's GNP growth target to between 0.5 percent
and 1.0 percent from the initial 1.5 percent, mainly because of
poor agricultural production in the first nine months.
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate stood unchanged in October at
a record 4.3 percent for the third straight month, the Management
and Coordination Agency announced Friday.
	   Japan's jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily in recent months. But it returned
to the record level in August, where it has hovered since amid a
nagging economic recession.
	   Also Friday, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, slipped again to
0.48 _ the lowest level since the government began compiling such
figures in 1963.
	   The figure means that only 48 jobs were available for every 100
people seeking employment.
	   The total number of employed dropped by 710,000 people from the
same period a year ago to 65.26 million, the ninth straight month
of declines, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   Those who left their jobs involuntarily rose by 380,000 people
to a record 940,000, said an agency official who declined to be
named.
	   The jobless rate for men aged 25-34 increased one percentage
point to an all-time high of 4.7 percent, while the rate for women
in the same age group rose by 0.8 point to 6.8 percent.

 &UR; Asian Development Bank sharply lowers growth forecasts for Asian
countries
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank sharply
lowered its growth forecasts for many countries in the Asian region
Friday in response to deepening problems in the past half year, but
said there are signs the financial crisis may be bottoming out.
	   The growth revisions released by the Manila-based bank starkly
show how sentiment toward a number of Asian countries has
dramatically worsened since its last forecasts in April.
	   The bank said economies of developing countries in East and
Southeast Asia, excluding China, are expected to contract by an
average 3.5 percent this year, their worst performance since World
War II.
	   Economies in Southeast Asia, the region hardest hit by the
crisis, are projected to shrink by an average 6.9 percent.
	   The ADB predicted that Indonesia's economy will contract by 16
percent this year. Its forecast in April had seen it shrinking by 3
percent.
	   Thailand's economy is forecast to shrink by 7 percent instead of
3 percent, while Malaysia's is expected to contract by 6 percent
instead of growing by 3.5 percent.
	   But ADB senior economist Christopher Walker said the regional
currency crisis is showing signs of improvement.
	   The past two months have seen a stronger Japanese yen buoying
regional currencies, interest rate cuts in the United States easing
a credit crunch there, and signs that international capital flows
are at last trickling back to a number of developing countries.
	   That will begin to counter a massive dlrs 110 billion flow of
private capital out of East and Southeast Asia since the end of
1996, Walker said.
	   He said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' as a result that Asia's
16-month-old crisis has bottomed out and that there ``should be
some recovery in 1999.''
	   The ADB said Southeast Asia's economic outlook for 1999 hinges
on the fate of financial reform initiatives and the mood of world
capital markets.
	   Japan's recently pledged dlrs 30 billion to help kick-start the
region's moribund economies may help increase official capital
flows to make up for lost private capital.
	   The bank said Southeast Asia is also bearing the brunt of the
social cost of the crisis. Of 200 million Indonesians, about 48
percent are now living in poverty, up from about 11 percent two
years ago, it said.
	   Unemployment rose to 7 percent in Malaysia, 9 percent in
Indonesia, 8 percent in Thailand and 13 percent in the Philippines,
the bank said.
	   The ADB emphasized that the region's flickering signs of
recovery could be quickly extinguished by a number of
uncertainties.
	   ``Conditions continue to deteriorate in many areas of the real
economy,'' it said, citing rising bad loans as corporate failures
worsen the banking sector's problems.
	   It said developments elsewhere, such as in Brazil, Russia and
the United States, could also affect prospects for an Asian
recovery.
	   The ADB said it also fears that some embattled economies may
ultimately be unable to resist the lure of foreign-exchange
controls, similar to those implemented by Malaysia in September, to
stabilize their currencies.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly lower
in light trading Friday.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 36.81 points, or 0.3 percent,
closing at 10,742.11. On Thursday, the index had gained 57.93
points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.79 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
742 million), down slightly from Thursday's 5.94 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 761 million).
	   Brokers said there was selective profit-taking following recent
gains in share prices.
	   They said trading was light as many investors stayed on the
sidelines awaiting government figures on Hong Kong's economic
growth for the third quarter.
	   After the market closed, the government announced that Hong
Kong's Gross Domestic Product shrank by about 7 percent during the
third quarter, following a 5.2 percent contraction in the second
quarter.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong Properties fell 75 cents to 57.50,
and Cheung Kong was unchanged at 58.50.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 dollar to 203.00,
and Hang Seng Bank fell 75 cents to 69.75.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchsion Whampoa fell 75 cents to 58.50, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' fell 20 cents to 36.50.

Kremlin: doctors say Yeltsin can work until end of his term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from story slugged BC-Russia. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who's currently
hospitalized with pneumonia, is capable of performing his duties
until the end of his term in 2000, a senior Kremlin official said
Friday, citing presidential doctors.
	   ``We trust the doctors whose job it is to take care of the
president,'' Oleg Sysuyev, the president's first deputy chief of
staff, told the Interfax news agency.
	   He dismissed suggestions that early presidential elections
should be held next fall at the same time as parliamentary
elections, saying that would destabilize the nation. ``That would
be a crime,'' Sysuyev was quoted as saying.
	   Yeltsin has been in a hospital since the weekend, undergoing
treatment for pneumonia, the latest in a series of illnesses that
have raised concerns about his ability to serve out his term.
	   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin reiterated
that Yeltsin has no crippling diseases, but said he remains a
restless patient reluctant to stay in bed when doctors order him to
do so.
	   ``Pneumonia hardly encourages active work,'' Yakushkin said.
``The essential thing now is to get well as fast as possible, and
to achieve that, one should heed doctors' advice. However, it's not
in the president character to do nothing, so, naturally, he doesn't
sit with his arms folded.''
	   Asked whether Yeltsin's aides might recommend that the president
resign before his term ends, Yakushkin said that would happen only
if the president suffered a serious health problem.
	   But, he added, ``that may happen to any person.''
	   Yeltsin has rarely appeared in public in recent months, and has
said little about the country's economic crisis, the worst in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Yeltsin continues to support Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov but
recently urged his Cabinet to work faster to deal with the crisis,
Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president, in general, doesn't like slowness,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin has urged the government to adhere to free-market
principles and not allow too much state intervention into the
economy, Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president isn't against an increased role for the state,
but he wouldn't approve extensive intervention for the sake of
intervention,'' the spokesman said.
	   Primakov said his Cabinet will continue free-market reforms, but
he has spoken out against Russia's ``wild capitalism'' and pushed
for a stronger state hand in economic affairs.
	   Asked whether Primakov's Cabinet will survive until the spring
without reshuffle, Yakushkin said there are no plans to oust any
government officials. But, ``there should be no stagnation,'' he
added.

Indonesian official says misuse of state funds still rampant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Misuse of public funds remains rampant
despite a government campaign to root out corruption, a top
government official said Friday.
	   Bowing to a public outcry, the government of President B.J.
Habibie has pledged to crack down on corruption associated with
former authoritarian leader Suharto.
	   But many observers say graft in public institutions remains
rampant.
	   ``All government departments and agencies still mishandle state
budgetary funds,'' said Satrio Budiharjo Judono, chairman of the
state audit board.
	   He said he reported findings from his first two weeks in the
post to Habibie but refused to disclose details.
	   The results of his report will be presented to Parliament, which
then can decide whether make the findings public.
	   Suharto quit in May after riots and protests against his rule.
Students have stepped up demands that he be tried on corruption
charges, and Habibie has ordered a new investigation of his
predecessor's wealth after an earlier probe turned up no evidence
of wrongdoing.

Adams to be allowed into Australia

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, will be allowed to
visit Australia in January.
	   Australian Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock refused Adams a
visa in 1996 citing his association with the Irish Republican Army.
The IRA had resumed its terror campaign in Britain at the time.
	   Ruddock said Friday his department has now granted Adams a visa,
following the significant advances toward achieving peace in the
troubled British province.
	   ``Australia looks to Mr. Adams and to Sinn Fein to shoulder
their full responsibility with all other parties to ensure rapid
progress in the peace process,'' Ruddock said.
	   Adams said in a radio interview broadcast in Australia Friday
that he wants to visit this country to meet old friends and make
new ones.
	   Irish community leader Dennis O'Flynn welcomed the decision,
noting that Adams had already been received in the White House and
is also accepted in Britain.

Job seekers fall by 9,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Unemployment fell to 11.6 percent in October from
11.7 percent, the Labor Ministry said Friday. The figure reflects a
slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one
of the nation's knottiest problems.
	   The improved figures were largely due to a gain in jobs by men
aged 25 to 49, according to the Labor Ministry.
	   The October data was better than expectations. Economists had
seen October's unemployment level steady from September.
	   According to the Labor Ministry and to the national unemployment
agency ANPE, the number of job seekers fell by 9,000, or 0.3
percent to 2.945 million people.
	   Job seekers aged 25 to 49 were the greatest gainers, with their
number falling by 5,400, or 0.6 percent.
	   The number of women job seekers aged 25 to 49 declined by 4,500,
or 0.4 percent. However, the number of female job seekers under 25
rose 2,300, or 0.9 percent.
	   Among older job seekers, men aged 50 and over saw a slight
improvement in their situation, with a 0.1 percent drop in
unemployment. But the number of women aged 50 rose by 900, or 0.5
percent, in October, compared to a month earlier.
	   High unemployment has for years been France's main economic
hurdle, and remains so despite steady improvements since Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took office in June 1997.

Federations seek common ground on doping sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting underway; comments from Primo Nebiolo
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Track and field chief Primo Nebiolo
challenged Olympic sports federations Friday to stop bickering and
unite in their efforts to fight doping.
	   Leaders of 35 international sports federations met with
International Olympic Committee officials Friday in a bid to
strengthen the battle against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The IOC wants the 28 summer and seven winter federations to
endorse common rules, procedures and sanctions to cleanse the
sports world of steroids and other banned substances.
	   IOC leaders are intent on getting the federations to fall into
line before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit in Lausanne.
	   Cycling, whose image was wrecked by revelations of systematic
doping during the Tour de France, and soccer, which has resisted
IOC dictates, were under particular scrutiny Friday.
	   ``Do we .. face the problem of doping in a strong and united way
or do we show ourselves to be weak and divided?'' Nebiolo,
president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, said in
opening remarks.
	   ``We have an opportunity to show the outside world that all of
sport is united in its conviction that doping can be faced in a
legitimate and believable way.''
	   Nebiolo, who also heads the association of all summer Olympic
federations, said the sports bodies must ``go beyond criticizing
each other and realize that now is the time to unite in our
efforts. ...
	   ``Do we react today in a responsible, but reasonable way for the
better of the whole or do we let ourselves be consumed by our own
individual interests? Some sacrifices will have to made by all of
us.''
	   Officials said Friday's meeting would focus on getting consensus
in principle on several key issues:
	   _ adoption of a unified medical code
	   _ a definition of doping
	   _ uniformity of doping sanctions
	   _ creation of a world anti-doping agency
	   _ cooperation with government institutions
	   _ educational and ethical intitiatives
	   _ protection of athletes' rights
	   Achieving unity on sanctions has proven especially elusive, with
different federations applying different penalties for the same
offense.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical
commission, said total harmonization of sanctions is impossible,
calling it ``an intellectual dream.''
	   ``We can't tell the federations what to do,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``They have their autonomy.
The IOC can only give guidelines.''
	   De Merode said he advocates the gradual elimination of fixed
penalties in favor of a flexible scale of mininum and maximum
sanctions.
	   Nebiolo said he would like all federations to accept the IAAF's
mininum two-year suspension for a first steroid offense, while
allowing flexibility for ``exceptional circumstances.''
	   ``The main idea is to have a high-profile minimum sanction,''
Nebiolo told the AP.
	   Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, suggested that
federations which don't go along with common anti-doping policy
should be dropped from the Olympics.
	   ``I think some of the federations have to say, `You know, if
we're going to be part of the Olympic movement, we've got to buy
into this. If we don't, maybe some sports will sit out.' I think
that would be an important statement on behalf of the Olympics.''
	   But De Merode said it would be a ``fatal mistake'' to threaten
to kick sports out of the Olympics. And Nebiolo said putting
pressure on federations was not the answer.
	   ``I hope in the sense of responsibility of each federation,'' he
said.
	   On another key issue, the federations will be asked to support
establishment of an independent doping agency to coordinate drug
testing around the world.
	   Pound, who heads the project, said the agency could be up and
running early next year with initial funding of dlrs 25 million,
taken from Olympic television revenues.
	   Officials said Friday's meeting will not take up the specifics
of a controvesial system of drug sanctions proposed by an IOC
working group.
	   The proposals, as described by Gunnar Werner, secretary of the
international swimming federation, divide doping offenses into two
categories _ ``regular'' and ``aggravated'' cases _ and call for
maximum sanctions of life bans and dlrs 1 million fines.
	   Werner and Pound both criticized the system as too complicated.
The proposals will likely come up at the IOC executive board
meeting in Lausanne on Dec. 11-14.

Saddam's half-brother thought ready to return to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Barzan al-Tikriti, the half-brother of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and former ambassador to the United
Nations in Geneva, seems set to return to Baghdad, a Swiss official
said Friday.
	   ``We have information from reliable sources'' that Barzan
al-Tikriti is preparing to leave, said Christoph Mueller, spokesman
for the Swiss Federal Office for Foreigners.
	   The Swiss government says al-Tikriti has until the end of
November to leave Geneva under Swiss laws allowing U.N. diplomats
to stay on for three months after the end of their tenure.
	   Al-Tikriti had not applied for a residence permit beyond that
point, Mueller said.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations
in Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   His wife, Ahlam, who had reportedly been under treatment for
breast cancer, died earlier this month in Switzerland.
	   Al-Tikriti reportedly had cited his wife's illness and treatment
as reasons for his staying in Geneva, but denied having any desire
to join the Iraqi opposition.
	   Al-Tikriti received condolences at the Iraqi ambassador's
residence in Geneva.
	   He has already been replaced as ambassador by Mohammed al-Douri,
a legal adviser in the foreign ministry, Iraqi officials said this
week.
	   Earlier this month Iraqi dissidents said a cousin of Saddam
failed to convince al-Tikriti to return home instead of going into
exile.
	   Al-Tikriti has six children, ranging in age from 11 to 26.

Japanese stocks close lower, dollar rises against yen

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. UPDATES with late afternoon bond and currency prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices closed lower on Friday,
pushed down by selling pressure from domestic corporate investors.
The dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 138.38 points,
or 0.91 percent, to close at 15,069.39. On Thursday, it rose 134.30
points, or 0.89 percent.
	   The dollar bought 122.86 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.94
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late
London level of 122.25 yen overnight.
	   U.S. financial markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving
holiday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, heavy selling by Japanese
corporations anxious to raise cash was able to offset buying from
individual and foreign investors, traders said.
	   Investors shrugged off news reports that Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa plans to leave the Cabinet and resign his post as head of
a major ruling party faction.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 6.24 points, or 0.54
percent, to 1,158.35. The TOPIX closed up 10.91 points, or 0.47
percent, the day before.
	   About 505 million shares changed hands on the first section on
Friday, up from 500.13 million issues the previous day. Gainers
exceeded declining shares 659 to 544, with 103 issues closing
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, many foreign dealers in Japan and players
based in the U.S. were absent due to Thanksgiving, traders said.
	   The thin trading boosted the dollar's gains, allowing it to hit
a 10-day high of 123.02 yen at one point. It fell as low as 122.02
during the day.
	   The reports of Miyazawa's impending departure also had little
impact on the currency market.
	   ``The market was expecting it,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury
manager at Commerzbank. ``And at this point it doesn't matter who
takes his place as the rails have already been laid for the
stability of the financial system.''
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.075 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.035 percent,
driving its price down to 106.27 yen from 106.64 yen.

Cambodian Opposition leader to judge government by budget actions

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian opposition leader Sam
Rainsy said Friday that the structure of next year's budget and how
it is implemented will determine whether Premier Hun Sen's
government is serious about economic reform.
	   Speaking outside parliament as the new National Assembly formed
specialized commissions, Sam Rainsy said he was pleasantly
surprised by reports that on Monday Hun Sen will submit to the
assembly a policy statement calling for widespread reforms along
with his proposed Cabinet.
	   The opposition leader said he would give Hun Sen's coalition the
benefit of the doubt, but was skeptical that the premier's
Cambodian People's Party would dismantle a governing system he said
was characterized by corruption.
	   ``Either they really want reform and they would be prepared to
accept a lot of sacrifices to see their power curtailed, or it's a
trick,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party holds 15 of the assembly's 122 seats,
said passage and implementation of the 1999 budget will show if the
CPP is serious about reform.
	   ``You won't need to wait for years. In the next three months we
will see whether there will be improvement,'' he said.
	   The opposition leader advocated lower spending on the military
and security forces _ which absorbed more than half of the 1998
budget _ and substantially more funding for health, education and
rural development.
	   Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister, said he would look to the
International Monetary Fund for clues as to whether true reform was
being carried out by the government.
	   The IMF cut assistance to Cambodia when the last government
failed to collect state revenues, especially in the timber industry
where tens of millions of dollars in potential revenue was siphoned
off by corrupt politicians and the military.
	   ``If you see the IMF is prepared to resume its assistance, then
that means Cambodia is definitely on the right track,'' Sam Rainsy
said.
	   Hun Sen narrowly won a July election, but his party did not
capture enough seats in the National Assembly to govern alone.
	   After more than three months of political deadlock, he struck a
deal on Nov. 13 to form a coalition government with election
runner-up Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Hun Sen's CPP and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party split up evenly
the number of posts in the Cabinet, but the CPP retained tight
administrative and fiscal control by placing its members atop the
finance, commerce, industry, agriculture and foreign affairs
ministries.
	   Because the CPP holds a majority in the 122-seat National
Assembly, the party does not need FUNCINPEC or the opposition to
pass the budget proposal of Hun Sen's government.

Russian govt. wants to certify that newspapers are clean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new government order will require publishers of
newspapers, magazines and books to get health certificates saying
their products are safe, a move publishers have denounced as a curb
on the media.
	   Publishers say the requirement, which will take effect next
year, is an attempt to give the government more control over the
media and raise additional revenues, The Moscow Times newspaper
reported this week.
	   The Health Ministry says it's concerned that print that's too
small could damage the eyesight of readers, and poor quality ink
could rub off on people's hands and be transmitted to the food they
eat.
	   ``Readers are putting their health at potential risk every time
they read a book, newspaper or magazine,'' Boris Bokichko of the
State Health Inspection Committee, was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.
	   The Health Ministry plans to require printing houses to undergo
inspections every one to three years in order to have their
publications certified.
	   A group of 16 newspapers and publishing houses has sent a letter
to the Health Ministry saying the measure would undermine their
businesses, which are already struggling due to the country's
economic crisis.
	   Gennady Kudy, the executive secretary of the Publishers' Guild,
said he would try to stop the measure.
	   ``This is sheer lunacy,'' he was quoted as saying by the
newspaper. ``Do these people have nothing better to do with their
time? We are going to fight this all the way to court if need be.''

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ The Fiji government will sell 49 percent of
telecommunications company Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Ltd. in the
largest commercial transaction in the history of the small Pacific
island nation.
	   The Fiji National Provident Fund would buy the stake for Fiji
dollars 253 million (U.S. dlrs 126.5 million), Finance Minister Jim
Ah Koy said Friday.
	   He said Britain's Cable and Wireless group and France Telecom
were unsuccessful bidders.
	   Lionel Yee, chief executive of the fund, said it was discussing
a management arrangement with Telecom New Zealand.
	   The Fiji National Provident Fund is a statutory national
compulsory savings scheme with funds standing at Fiji dollars 1.9
billion (U.S. dlrs 950 million).
	   Amalgamated Telecom Holdings is the 100 percent owner of Telecom
Fiji Ltd., operator of the Pacific island nation's domestic
telephone services, and 51 percent owners of Fiji International
Telecommunications Ltd., monopoly operator of international
telecommunications services.
	   Cable and Wireless owns 49 percent of FINTEL. Ah Koy said Cable
and Wireless would retain its stake in FINTEL.

More U.N. inspectors arrive in Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ More U.N. inspectors have arrived in
Baghdad to carry out searches of Iraq's suspected weapons sites and
some teams went out on a field trip Friday, usually the weekly
holiday for the inspectors.
	   Reporters saw at least six more inspectors arriving Thursday at
the Canal House, the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
They came on a U.N. flight from the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   U.N. teams have gone out daily since inspections resumed last
week after Iraq canceled its ban on their work Nov. 14 under the
threat of a U.S. and British attack.
	   Caroline Cross, the spokeswoman for U.N. inspectors in Baghdad,
said teams went out again Friday, the Muslim sabbath and a day that
inspectors normally used to take off.
	   ``We have a lot to do,'' Cross told The Associated Press. She
did not elaborate.
	   The United Nations has brought more inspectors to rebuild the
full contingent present in Baghdad before the crisis, she said.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles, chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and
programs before an oil embargo and other U.N. sanctions can be
lifted. The sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded
Kuwait, starting the 1991 Gulf War.
	   On Thursday, inspectors checked nine sites, including two not
equipped with surveillance cameras or monitors, the Iraqi News
Agency quoted Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate as saying.
	   It said a team specializing in chemical searches checked two
sites Thursday, but Cross refused to confirm that. Nuclear
inspectors took samples from six sites in Baghdad, INA said.
	   A Chicago-based aid group, Voices in the Wilderness, ended their
weeklong trip to Baghdad on Friday. It donated medicine worth
several thousand dollars to hospitals in Baghdad and Basra.
	   The group has visited Iraq 18 times since the Gulf War.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A Greek shepherd killed an Albanian
shepherd and wounded his brother in a dispute over a pasture that
straddles the countries' border, an Interior Ministry spokesman
said Friday.
	   The unidentified Greek fired his hunting rifle after arguing
Thursday afternoon with his two Albanian counterparts tending their
sheep in grassland near the Albanian border village of Radat, said
Artan Bizhga, the ministry spokesman.
	   The ministry identified the dead shepherd as Afrim Kazma, 30,
and his wounded brother as Gezim Kazma, 38.
	   Bizhga said Albanian and Greek border officials were to meet
Friday to discuss the incident.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has sunk even deeper into recession,
the government said Friday in a report that cast a gloomy outlook
on the territory's economic performance for the year.
	   The Hong Kong government said gross domestic product fell by
about 7 percent in the third quarter, prompting its economists to
predict the economy will contract by 5 percent for all of 1998. The
government had previously predicted the economy would shrink by 4
percent.
	   Hong Kong's GDP had fallen by 5.2 percent in the second quarter
and 2.7 percent in the first quarter.
	   Residents are feeling the pinch, with unemployment hovering at
15-year highs of around 5 percent.
	   In a random telephone survey conducted this month by Hong Kong
University of more than 500 respondents, 54.7 percent said the
economic situation has not improved, while 36.2 percent said the
government was incapable of solving the crisis.
	   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent.

Romania fascist legionnaires to mark anniversary of leader's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ About 200 former members of Romania's
Iron Guard will mark the 60th anniversary of their leader's death
in likely the biggest fascist turnout in recent times here, an
organizer said Friday.
	   Relatives of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu known as ``the Captain''
who led the pro-Hitler group from 1927-38 called on followers to
attend an Orthodox Christian feast to mark his death Saturday.
	   The Legionnaires terrorized Romania during World War II, killing
a few political leaders, including two premiers. They tried to
seize power in 1941 but their revolt was quelled.
	   Under communism, which ended in 1989 in Romania, mere mention of
the movement was strictly forbidden. Romania's current constitution
outlaws communist and Legionnaire organizations.
	   In recent years, there has been a revival in the fascist
movement. Books and magazines have attempted to exonerate the
Legionnaires.
	   Codreanu, a lawyer, was killed in 1938 on the orders of King
Carol II in a forest near Bucharest. Carol's henchmen also killed
three of Codreanu's brothers.
	   ``During communism young people did not learn real history,''
said Catalin Zelea Codreanu, 87, the captain's brother, who is
organizing the meeting. He says the Iron Guard was a positive
nationalist movement which gradually degenerated.
	   Communists arrested him in 1945 and he was imprisoned for 17
years for his anti-Soviet stance.
	   He said his brother was ``a great man who deeply loved his
country and that's why he was killed.''
	   Romania's pro-Nazi wartime leader, Marshal Ion Antonescu,
outlawed the Legionnaires in 1941 after they tried to oust him in a
coup.
	   Romania was allied with Nazi Germany during the war until King
Michael helped stage a coup against Antonescu in August 1944 taking
Romania over to the Allies.

Former Soviet star to coach AEK

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Oleg Blochin, once the star of Dynamo Kiev
and the former Soviet national team, has taken over Greece's
first-division soccer club AEK Athens, the club said Friday.
	   Blochin, a Ukrainian, will be at AEK's helm until June 2000. The
announcement did not disclose the financial terms of the contract.
	   Blochin replaced Dragoslav Stepanovic, who was dismissed after
coaching AEK for just four months. A series of bad performances led
AEK's administration to fire the Serbian coach, but they may be
forced to pay him a generous buy-out.
	   The 46-year-old Blochin has coached other Greek teams such as
Olympiakos Piraeus, PAOK Salonica and Ionikos Nikea.
	   ``Time has come for AEK to gain a league title,'' Blochin told
his players in his first meeting Thursday.
	   The last time AEK won the title was 1994. It is presently in
second place behind Panathinaikos Athens.
	   Blochin, who was selected as Europe's top player in 1975, is the
21st coach for AEK since 1980.

South Africans begin first-ever voter registration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, color, quotes; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Dogged by confusion and
disorganization, election officials pressed ahead Friday with the
creation of the first voter roll to include South Africans of all
colors.
	   People muddled their way to registration stations across five
northern provinces, home to about half the 25 million eligible
voters at the start of a three-day registration period. The other
half of the country registers Dec. 4-6.
	   Some had the wrong identity papers. Others couldn't find their
venue, published in newspapers only Friday. A few stations didn't
have enough staff to open, and difficulties with the hand-held
bar-code readers were reported.
	   But it appeared the problems were scattered, and the majority of
people at registration stations made it through in five to 10
minutes.
	   Election officials were not surprised by the problems. The
Independent Electoral Commission, up and running only 1 1-2 years
ago, has had to organize the registration with limited funds.
	   In the first all-race elections, which ended apartheid in 1994
and brought the African National Congress to power, people simply
had to show up at the polls. Establishing the voter roll is a major
step in the country's transformation from white minority rule to
true democracy.
	   ``I have seen problems this morning,'' said Johann Kriegler, the
commission's chairman. ``It's an immensely complicated exercise.
... We'll patch it up. We'll make it good before we're finished
with it,'' he told Associated Press Television News.
	   Registration was supposed to be only Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. But lack of personnel, uncertainty among people over where
to register and the large numbers of people without the proper ID
books caused the commission to spread out the process, adding a
three-day period in January and another in February.
	   The military was called out to help civil servants staff the
stations.
	   Seven air force personnel manned a venue at a lawn bowling club
in the exclusive white suburb of Johannesburg. By 9 a.m., two hours
into registration, 85 people had come through, with three turned
back because they lacked the latest generation of IDs -- which have
a bar code read by a scanner.
	   ``It's just so disorganized,'' said Gilda Lee Fritz, 47, who was
turned away. ``I'm really upset by this. I'm telling you, it's a
ploy to prevent certain people from voting.''
	   She meant whites. The vast majority of the millions of South
Africans without the bar-code IDs -- which the commission and ANC
established as a requirement to vote and register -- are white.
With the fall of apartheid, blacks rushed to replace their
restrictive apartheid-era IDs with the new ones.
	   The white-supported National Party, which denied the vote to
blacks while ruling under apartheid, says it will challenge the
bar-code ID requirement in court, saying the ANC is trying to deny
whites the vote.
	   ``I had to go get mine, so I don't see why others can't do the
same,'' said Bernard Mokhachene, a black executive who held up his
new ID while registering in the run-down, integrated neighborhood
of Yeoville.
	   President Nelson Mandela, who registered at a primary school
near his home in the wealthy Houghton suburb, said the National
Party was ``entitled'' to challenge the registration if it had
reservations.
	   Surveys estimate about 5 million people lack the new IDs, but
the government put the number at about half that.
	   Elections are likely to take place next May, though no date has
been set.

Australia urges Indonesia to cut troop numbers in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURABAYA, Indonesia (AP) _ Australia urged Indonesia Friday to
reduce its troops in East Timor as part of international efforts to
reach a lasting peace in the troubled territory.
	   Visiting Australian Defense Minister John Moore raised concerns
about army activity in the former Portuguese colony during talks
with Indonesia's military chief and Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto.
	   ``We think that fewer troops in East Timor would be helpful,''
Moore said at a news conference after the 90-minute talks.
	   On Thursday, Australia said Indonesia had granted it permission
to send a military observer to East Timor to monitor the security
situation there.
	   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, John McCarthy, said a
military attache from his embassy in Jakarta would travel to East
Timor on Tuesday.
	   Indonesia and Portugal are engaged in a new round of
U.N.-sponsored talks over the fate of East Timor, which Indonesian
invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   In a bid to end the ongoing conflict with separatist rebels,
Indonesia has offered to grant autonomy to the half-island
territory in return for international recognition of its
sovereignty there.
	   Earlier this year Indonesia announced that it had withdrawn some
combat troops from East Timor as a goodwill gesture. However,
critics have said it has actually increased numbers.
	   Moore also said he had asked for permission for an Australian
investigator to visit East Timor as part of a new inquiry into the
deaths of six foreign journalists killed when Indonesian troops
invaded East Timor in 1975.
	   Indonesia maintains the men, Australian, New Zealand and British
citizens, were killed in crossfire during hostilities. East
Timorese activists say the men were executed.
	   Moore said Wiranto made no immediate response to the request.
	   The journalists' deaths have been a long-running issue between
the two neighboring countries.

Palestinians and Israeli troops clash in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians stoned Jewish settlers and
Israeli soldiers Friday after settlers blocked Palestinian
motorists from using a road near their enclave and then marched
into the Palestinian-run sector of this divided city.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse the
stone-throwers and eventually escorted the group of about 20
settlers, most of them women, back into the Israeli-controlled
downtown area.
	   The clashes were triggered by the Israeli army's decision to
open a road near the Jewish enclave of Avraham Avinu. The road had
been closed to Palestinian motorists after hand grenades were
thrown from there at a group of Israeli soldiers in September.
	   On Friday, a bulldozer cleared cement blocks from the road.
Jewish settlers responded angrily, saying they were being
endangered by Palestinian traffic passing close by their homes.
	   ``Many people have been wounded in this street,'' said settler
leader Noam Arnon. ``I am afraid the reopening of the street will
not bring peace and security.''
	   In response, settlers briefly blocked the street to Palestinian
motorists. Several settlers then walked toward the Palestinian
sector. Israeli troops tried to stop them, but the settlers kept on
walking.
	   As the settlers reached the Palestinian side, Palestinians threw
stones at them from nearby rooftops. Soldiers responded with rubber
bullets, and the settlers were eventually escorted back.
	   Hebron is the site of frequent friction between settlers,
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians. About 450 settlers live in the
downtown area which remains under Israeli control. The remainder of
the city of 130,000 Palestinians is run by the Palestinian
Authority.

Singapore cuts aircraft landing fees by 10 percent in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: All figures in U.S. dollars

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Following the government's package this week
that will reduce the cost of doing business in Singapore, the Civil
Aviation Authority of Singapore on Friday said it will cut aircraft
landing fees by 10 percent for one year.
	   The cut, that will be applied from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 1999, will
benefit all airlines using Singapore's Changi Airport.
	   By bringing the fees to about the level in 1981, when the
airport was first opened, airlines will be able to save about dlrs
11 million, the authority said.
	   Citing the regional economic downturn that has affected airport
businesses, it said it will extend its 15 percent rebate on rental
of offices, shops and warehouses at the airport for another year to
end June 2000.
	   That reduction is expected to save companies about dlrs 9
million.
	   The authority added that it will further extend its current
rebate on the airport shop concession fee for another 12 months to
end June 2000. That is expected to generate savings of another dlrs
14.5 million.
	   The city-state's flag-carrier, Singapore Airlines, last month
reported a 24 percent fall in net profit for the first half of the
fiscal year and predicted poor prospects in the Asian travel
market.

Thai foreign minister respects Saudi withdrawal from Asian games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's last-minute decision not
to compete at next month's Asian Games should be respected by all,
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Friday.
	   ``If they are not ready or have other engagements as they
claimed, then we should respect their decision,'' Surin told
reporters upon his return from a tour to the Middle East, where he
visited Qatar, Bahrain, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
	   Surin said he does not believe the decision to pull out of the
biggest sporting event in Asia was politically motivated, as is
widely suspected in Thailand.
	   The sudden withdrawal of the 105-strong team throws the games'
schedules into disarray and has proved embarrassing for Thailand.
	   Saudi sports authorities had cited scheduling conflicts with
national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan as reasons for the withdrawal.
	   But relations between Riyadh and Bangkok have been sour for
several years because Thai authorities failed to recover most of
the dlrs 2 million in jewelry stolen from the palace of a Saudi
Arabian prince by a Thai worker in 1989 and never solved the
murders of three Saudi diplomats and a businessman in 1990-91.
	   Rumor has long had it that some of the stolen jewelry made it
into the hands of members of Thailand's power elite who for social
reasons are usually untouchable by legal authorities.
	   Saudi Arabia has in the past said relations would only be
normalized when the two cases were solved.
	   Thai Parliament President Wan Mohammad Noor Matha, a Muslim, was
one figure who described the Saudi action as political, The Nation
newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``They should have informed us in advance,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Bhichai Rattakul, chairman of the games' organizing
committee, was quoted in the newspaper as saying.

Arch-rivals of Turkish politics signal alliance once again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The two arch-rivals of Turkish politics
have signaled a willingness to put aside their animosity and join
in an alliance to govern Turkey until elections in April, reports
said Friday.
	   Party leaders are engaged in intense negotiations to form a new
government after Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz'
17-month-old government in a no-confidence vote Wednesday over a
mafia scandal.
	   No party has a majority to govern alone in the deeply fragmented
Parliament, and an alliance between pro-secular parties that would
exclude a pro-Islamic party is a must to avoid a possible
confrontation with the military.
	   Both Yilmaz and his political rival, former premier Tansu
Ciller, declared themselves ready for cooperation with each other.
Mrs. Ciller on Thursday declared herself ``open to proposals.''
	   ``We can move together in certain issues,'' Milliyet newspaper
quoted Yilmaz as saying Friday.
	   The first signs of a possible cooperation were given last week
when both Mrs. Ciller and Yilmaz had their parties blocked
corruption probes into each other.
	   Both head two center-right parties with little differing
ideologies. Their animosity stems from a struggle to win ground
among center-right electorate.
	   A 1996 alliance broke up after only three months when Yilmaz'
party backed a corruption inquiry into Mrs. Ciller.
	   However, neither have enough votes to sustain a majority and
would need the backing of a third party. Bulent Ecevit, who is the
deputy premier in the caretaker government made clear Thursday that
the two parties could count on his support.
	   President Suleyman Demirel was expected to conclude his
consultations with party leaders to piece together a coalition on
Friday.
	   Yilmaz remains caretaker premier until a new government is
formed.
	   In a move to avoid a standoff with the military, the pro-Islamic
party said Thursday it would not insist on his rightful chance to
lead the next government. The job of forming a new government
normally falls on the leader of Virtue as the largest party in
Parliament. But the staunchly secular military, which has pressured
Turkey's first Islamic-led government out of power, would oppose
such a move.
	   ``For many people the alternative of a government including
Virtue is the military,'' commented columnist Ismet Berkan of daily
Radikal Friday, referring to a possible coup.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.

Poland offers elite troops to protect head of Kosovo OSCE mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland has offered troops from its elite
military unit to guard the head of the Kosovo Verification Mission
being run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Tomaszewski, who also is interior
minister, agreed Thursday to send the soldiers from the GROM rapid
reaction force if needed to guard American envoy William Walker,
the head of the OSCE mission in Kosovo.
	   The mission being set up in the restive Serbian province in
Yugoslavia will send 2,000 unarmed verifiers to Kosovo to make sure
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic complies with agreements
he reached with U.S. envoys and the OSCE intended to halt the
Kosovo conflict.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority seeks independence from
Serbian rule, and Milosevic sent troops and special police to the
province in February to crack down on separatists. The resulting
fighting killed hundreds and forced an estimated 300,000 people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, from their homes.
	   Poland's PAP state news agency reported the unit guarding
Walker, if sent, would comprise 27 soldiers. Poland currently holds
the rotating chairmanship of the 54-nation OSCE, a diplomatic
alliance in Europe.
	   Also Thursday, Tomaszewski met with German Gen. Joachim
Spiering, the NATO commander for Central Europe, to discuss
Poland's preparations to join the Western strategic alliance next
year.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are scheduled to become
the first former Warsaw Pact states to join NATO at its summit in
April in Washington celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
alliance.
	   Spiering, on a one-day visit to Poland, also met with Defense
Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz and military officials.
	   He said NATO membership would force Poland to make changes in
its military command structure, communications and weaponry.
	   ``These are big tasks, but the whole process is on the right
path,'' Spiering said.
	   Poland is cutting troop strength from 241,000 to about 180,000,
with career soldiers comprising about half the reduced force.

Strike hobbles lines across France for second time in week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA DOLAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Train service slowed to a crawl on Friday during
the second national rail strike in a week in France. A poll showed
that support for train workers' grievances remains strong but is
waning.
	   About one in three long-distance trains was running Friday and
one in four regional trains, the state-run train authority, the
SNCF, said. Suburban lines used heavily to get people to work were
hobbled.
	   Eurostar trains to London were not effected by the strike.
	   Early Friday morning at the Gare de l'Est, travelers crowded
around revised timetables that were often incorrect.
	   ``It's going to be really difficult today,'' SNCF employee Said
Skender told a group of some 20 people gathered around an
information booth at the Gare de l''Est.
	   ``Even if the timetable says 1:00 p.m., you never know when the
train will actually leave.''
	   A few people were visibly irate, shouting at employees.
	   ``There's supposed to be minimum service,'' called out one
person waiting for a train. ``This isn't minimum service. I'm not
going to get there at all.''
	   But many travelers said they sympathized with strikers.
	   ``They know what they have to do to get people to listen to
their problems,'' said Parisian Pulal Ardobah, 35. ``It's annoying,
but I understand.''
	   A poll by the CSA firm, published in Friday's edition of the
daily Le Parisien showed that 56 percent of those sampled support
or have sympathy for strikers, compared to 25 percent who are
opposed or hostile.
	   But that is a drop from the 70 percent sympathy rating
registered during Monday's strike by rail workers in six European
countries, including France, to protest plans to open state-owned
railways to private operators in the European Union.
	   The EU said the proposed changes, which are not set to go into
effect immediately, would be limited to the freight sector.
	   The margin of error for the poll, which sampled 1,001 adults,
was not available, but with such a sampling is usually plus or
minus three percent.
	   Rail workers are protesting what they see as insufficient staff,
and are concerned about how the government will implement a plan to
cut the workweek from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Unions were to meet later Friday to decide whether to continue
the walkout, which started Thursday at 8 p.m., beyond Saturday
morning.

Paper: Habad rabbi beaten by skin heads in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An ultra-Orthodox rabbi working in a provincial
town in Russia to bring Jews closer to their heritage was severely
beaten up by skin heads, the daily Haaretz said Friday.
	   Rabbi Zalman Yaffo was attacked last month by three skin heads
as he was leaving his home in Nizhniy Novgorod, about 250 miles
(400 km) east of Moscow, the paper said.
	   Yaffo, the representative of the ultra-Orthodox movement Habad
in the area, was hospitalized for a day because of the beating,
Haaretz said.
	   Habad officials and Israeli and other Jewish representatives
kept the incident quiet for over a month, the paper said.
	   Rabbi Berl Lazar, a Habad representative in Russia, told the
paper that the beating was an isolated incident and that ``media
hype about anti-Semitic utterances only heightens the danger.''
	   Lazar also told Haaretz that the 100 Habad representatives in
the former Soviet Union had been told to exercise caution after the
May bombing of a Moscow Habad synagogue.
	   ``We are being more careful than ever not to stand out and not
to attract attention,'' Lazar told Haaretz. Habad has a successful
program of bringing non-observant Jews back to religious practice.
	   The police investigation of the attack is continuing, but the
assailants have not been apprehended, Haaretz said.
	   The report followed other incidents of anti-Semitism in Russia.
Parliament member General Albert Makashov last month blamed
Russia's troubles on ``zhidy,'' a derogatory term for Jews.
	   Duma member Galina Starovoitova, who led a campaign to censure
him for remarks, was killed last Friday by unknown assailants.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nineteen people in Siberia have been hospitalized
with food poisoning after consuming a potent liquid solution used
as a vitamin supplement on chicken farms, a news report said
Friday.
	   The solution was stolen from a farm and sold as vegetable oil at
a market in Ulan Ude, in southern Siberia, near the Mongolian
border, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Among those who consumed the product were the suspected thief
and his family, and they were also among those hospitalized, the

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Giant cranes untangled piled up train
carriages Friday to uncover more victims _ many of the mangled
beyond recognition _ from the wreckage of a two-train collision,
bringing the number of bodies recovered to 148.
	   Officials said 260 people were injured and about 30 were in
critical condition in hospitals across the northern state of
Punjab. Teams of doctors operated all night, amputating the legs or
hands of some of the victims of Thursday's accident.
	   Rescue workers, fighting the stench of rotting flesh, tore apart
the wreckage to dig out the victims. No survivors have been found
since midday Thursday.
	   ``Many of the bodies are badly mutilated. We may never be able
to identify them,'' said A. K. Kapoor, a top official of the
government-owned railroad company who was supervising the rescue
operations.
	   Work speeded up after the arrival of the huge crane that could
lift an entire train car. Some 5,000 workers supported the wobbly
wreckage with planks of wood and steel beams. Others used acetylene
torches or crowbars.
	   ``We're hoping to clear the tracks tonight,'' Kapoor told
reporters in this northern wheat-trading town, 250 kilometers (150
miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi and had
toppled into the path of the oncoming train on parallel tracks in
pre-dawn mist.
	   A day after the accident, relatives of the victims began
arriving in Khanna to identify their kin. The injured were
scattered in hospitals and medical colleges, depending on their
injuries.
	   For Ram Pravesh the search ended Friday noon. After endless
visits hospitals with local volunteers, he found the body of his
father, Ram Nageena.
	   The 10-year-old boy fainted at the sight of the body on a block
of ice at the local college playground that had been turned into a
makeshift mortuary.
	   Ram Pravesh, a native of Bharukpur village in Uttar Pradesh was
traveling to Punjab to work with his father on a farm. Authorities
sent messengers to his village to inform his mother and sister.
	   India records around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the
largest rail network under one management in the world. Most are
blamed on human error or outdated equipment.
	   Friday's newspapers said safety recommendations are often
ignored in the rush to expand the network, often to please
voters.The government-owned railroad company added 500 trains in
the last four years.
	   The worst accident was three years ago when two trains collided
near New Delhi, killing 358 people.
	   The Indian Express newspaper said a flashing light on the engine
and last coach of the train _ a recommendation of numerous safety
committees _ might have prevented the accident. The government has
said it has little money for better equipment.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track.

Palestinians and Israeli troops clash in Hebron

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians stoned Jewish settlers and
Israeli soldiers Friday after settlers blocked Palestinian
motorists from using a road near their enclave and then marched
into the Palestinian-run sector of this divided city.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse the
stone-throwers and eventually escorted the group of about 20
settlers, most of them women, back into the Israeli-controlled
downtown area.
	   The clashes were triggered by the Israeli army's decision to
open a road near the Jewish enclave of Avraham Avinu. The road had
been closed to Palestinian motorists after hand grenades were
thrown from there at a group of Israeli soldiers in September.
	   On Friday, a bulldozer cleared cement blocks from the road.
Jewish settlers responded angrily, saying they were being
endangered by Palestinian traffic passing close by their homes.

Singapore gets another taste of smoke haze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES pollution index level in graf 3; INSERTS graf 5 with
government statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore suffered an unexpected bout of haze
on Friday when winds swept smoke from forest fires in neighboring
Indonesia over the city-state for the first time in months.
	   The pollution standards index _ which measures smoke haze and
other air pollutants _ climbed into the ``moderate'' range in the
morning.
	   By 2 p.m., the index had risen to 69. Any reading above 100 is
considered unhealthy, and health officials recommend curtailed
outdoor activity for school children and asthmatics.
	   Wong Teo Suan, deputy director of Singapore's Meteorological
Service, said the haze was from fires _ probably due to
land-clearing _ on the nearby Indonesian island of Sumatra, which
is experiencing drier weather.
	   ``There are a few isolated hot spots in central Sumatra and some
them are quite near Singapore,'' said Singapore's Environment
Ministry in a later statement.
	   A change in wind direction was sending ``smoke haze from the
forest fires to be blown over Singapore,'' explained Wong.
	   Visibility had dropped to about 5 kilometers (3 miles) around
Changi Airport at noon, he added.
	   ``But the fires are actually fairly isolated and we don't expect
them to spread further,'' Wong said. ``Prevailing winds are likely
to change course in the next few days too.''
	   By late afternoon, some of the haze had already begun to
dissipate, and the pollution index had started to drop.
	   The regional haze problem had subsided since April as the El
Nino weather pattern _ which caused unusually dry conditions that
exacerbated the spread of annual forest fires _ eased and was
replaced by wetter weather.

Teen-age victim of beheading attack struggles to survive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A 14-year-old boy who was attacked and
almost beheaded as part of a failed ritual killing is struggling to
survive despite several spinal chord wounds at the back of his
neck, doctors said Friday.
	   Charles Idem was attacked last weekend in what police say was a
ritual attack adhering to local practices. Human body parts,
including the head and heart, are sometimes used in cult ceremonies
in tribal Nigeria.
	   Idem was traveling from his village in southwestern Nigeria when
he was abducted and taken to a forest. Four assailants pushed him
into the edge of a fish pond and began hacking at his neck with
knives, a police investigator said on condition of anonymity.
	   The teen was admitted to the Lagos General Hospital and later
transferred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital under the
supervision a neuro-surgeon.
	   Doctors say Idem is losing spinal chord fluid, complicating his
recover and potentially putting his life at risk.
	   Over the course of the week, Idem has lost the use of his limbs
and is having difficulty swallowing food.

Paper: Habad rabbi beaten by skinheads in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An ultra-Orthodox rabbi working in a provincial
town in Russia to bring Jews closer to their heritage was severely
beaten up by skinheads, the daily Haaretz said Friday.
	   Rabbi Zalman Yaffo was attacked last month by three skinheads as
he was leaving his home in Nizhniy Novgorod, about 250 miles (400
km) east of Moscow, the paper said.
	   Yaffo, the representative of the ultra-Orthodox movement Habad
in the area, was hospitalized for a day because of the beating,
Haaretz said.
	   Habad officials and Israeli and other Jewish representatives
kept the incident quiet for over a month, the paper said.
	   Rabbi Berl Lazar, a Habad representative in Russia, told the
paper that the beating was an isolated incident and that ``media
hype about anti-Semitic utterances only heightens the danger.''

Myanmar confirms detention of foreigners to U.S. embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar officials have confirmed that an
American is one of three foreigners detained after illegally
crossing into the country from Thailand, a U.S. Embassy spokesman
said Friday.
	   A Myanmar government official told The Associated Press on
Thursday that the trio were found inside Myanmar's territory last
week without legal permission and had been brought to Taunggyi,
about 175 kilometers (110 miles) from where they were detained.
	   The three were identified by a Thai military intelligence
officer who monitors the border as U.S. citizen Michael John
Raedeke, 40; a Canadian resident of Hong Kong, Joseph Frank, 34;
and Dirk Rommeswinkel of Germany.
	   The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the embassy had made inquiries with
Myanmar's foreign ministry after hearing reports about the
foreigners from another embassy.
	   ``We have been officially informed that an American was among
the three picked up and they are now in Taunggyi,'' she said. ``We
will continue to work to get consular access.''
	   The German Embassy and the Australian embassy, which looks after
Canadian affairs in Myanmar, were unavailable for comment.
	   The three foreigners were seen riding rented motorcycles in the
rugged border region around Thailand's western Mae Hong Son
province last week. Thai troops saw them drive across the frontier
at Ban Mai Kai On Pass but were unable to get their attention.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is governed by the military and
has strict security measures in the border regions. Armed rebel
groups have been active in some areas.

More U.N. inspectors arrive in Iraq

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ More U.N. inspectors have arrived in
Baghdad to carry out searches of Iraq's suspected weapons sites and
some teams went out on a field trip Friday, usually the weekly
holiday for the inspectors.
	   Reporters saw at least six more inspectors arriving Thursday at
the Canal House, the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
They came on a U.N. flight from the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   U.N. teams have gone out daily since inspections resumed last
week after Iraq canceled its ban on their work Nov. 14 under the
threat of a U.S. and British attack.
	   Caroline Cross, the spokeswoman for U.N. inspectors in Baghdad,
said teams went out again Friday, the Muslim sabbath and a day that
inspectors normally used to take off.
	   ``We have a lot to do,'' Cross told The Associated Press. She
did not elaborate.
	   The United Nations has brought more inspectors to rebuild the
full contingent present in Baghdad before the crisis, she said.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles, chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and
programs before an oil embargo and other U.N. sanctions can be
lifted. The sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded
Kuwait, starting the 1991 Gulf War.
	   On Thursday, inspectors checked nine sites, including two not
equipped with surveillance cameras or monitors, the Iraqi News
Agency quoted Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate as saying.
	   It said a team specializing in chemical searches checked two
sites Thursday, but Cross refused to confirm that. Nuclear
inspectors took samples from six sites in Baghdad, INA said.
	   A Chicago-based aid group, Voices in the Wilderness, ended their
weeklong trip to Baghdad on Friday. It donated medicine worth
several thousand dollars to hospitals in Baghdad and Basra.
	   The group has visited Iraq 18 times since the Gulf War.

European Central Bank chief concerned by slowed economic growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In his most candid remarks yet on the
economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday
that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the
EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1.
	   Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation in the
pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to
boost the economy.
	   He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market
conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate cuts
toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate
countries.
	   Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and
Dec. 22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will
gauge the outlook for inflation and the EU economy.
	   The bank, which will set monetary policy for the currency bloc,
has been under pressure from politicians to keep interest rates low
to help boost growth and create jobs. While inflation is at its
lowest levels in decades _ just 1 percent in the euro-zone _
unemployment in the 11 nations remains stubbornly high at 10.9
percent.

No cash to replace broken fridges at Jakarta morgue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in ``needed'' in graf 6; ADDS in new graf 8 why
autopsies are uncommon. One name for Mardiyono is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Economic turmoil isn't just hard on
the living in Indonesia.
	   Two-thirds of the refrigeration units at the only Jakarta morgue
that conducts autopsies have broken down, a newspaper reported
Friday. And the cash-strapped government has no money to replace
them.
	   Only 10 of 28 units used to preserve corpses before post-mortem
examinations are working, The Jakarta Post quoted morgue chief
Mardiyono as saying Thursday.
	   Even the working units at state Cipto Mangunkusomo General
Hospital don't have enough power to bring the temperature down to
freezing. Thermometers registered temperatures between 10 and 20
degrees Celsius, the Post said.
	   Mardiyono urged the public to help buy new equipment for the
morgue because the government was unable to set aside funds to
replace the old units.
	   ``Please help us,'' he said. ``The refrigeration system is badly
needed here.''
	   He said the current refrigeration units had been installed
between 1978 and 1992. Autopsies are not common in the capital of
11 million people or in the rest of the country.
	   The cost of an autopsy is beyond the means of most Indonesian
families and there is little public awareness about the procedure.
Many people in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia also believe
autopsies are disrespectful toward the dead.
	   Indonesia is battling its worst economic crisis in decades. Many
hospitals have been unable to buy expensive imported equipment,
although international aid has partly alleviated the crisis.

Former Soviet star to coach AEK

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Oleg Blochin, once the star of Dynamo Kiev
and the former Soviet national team, has taken over Greece's
first-division soccer club AEK Athens, the club said Friday.
	   Blochin, a Ukrainian, will be at AEK's helm until June 2000. The
announcement did not disclose the financial terms of the contract.
	   Blochin replaced Dragoslav Stepanovic, who was dismissed after
coaching AEK for just four months. A series of bad performances led
AEK's administration to fire the Serbian coach, but they may be
forced to pay him a generous buy-out.
	   The 46-year-old Blochin has coached other Greek teams such as
Olympiakos Piraeus, PAOK Salonica and Ionikos Nikea.
	   ``Time has come for AEK to gain a league title,'' Blochin told
his players in his first meeting Thursday.
	   The last time AEK won the title was 1994. It is presently in
second place behind Panathinaikos Athens.
	   Blochin, who was selected as Europe's top player in 1975, is the
21st coach for AEK since 1980.

	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Miss Seychelles, in a contest held
in her homeland, won the Miss Personality title at the 1998 Miss
World contest.
	   Alvina Grandcourt won the title Thursday night, judges announced
Friday.
	   Miss Israel, an 18-year-old student who is expected to report
for military duty in her country early next year, was crowned Miss
World Thursday night.
	   Linor Abargil is due to begin 20 months of Israeli military

hopes the army will postpone her induction so she can fulfill her
yearlong duties as Miss World.
	   In other titles announced Friday, Miss World runner-up, France's
Veronique Caloc won for Europe. South Africa's Kerishnie Naicker
claimed the crown for Africa.
	   Chile's Daniella Lathrop won for the Americas, and Malaysia's
Pick Lin Lina Teoh, who was second runner-up in the Miss World
pageant, took home the Asian crown.
	   Jamaica's Christine Straw won the Oceania crown.
	   Brazil's Adriana Reis gained the Miss Photogenic title.
	   After 48 years, the beauty contest created by former British
serviceman Eric Morley to liven up drab, postwar England, underwent
a facelift for this year's contest, televised in 130 countries.
	   A British production company did away with the high heels and
swimsuit parade before the judges. Instead, the women paraded in
different sets of clothes, from a casual look to smart party
dresses. Rather than talking about themselves, they talked about
friends and future careers.

Microsoft, China's Founder team up to fight software piracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. and China's Founder Group plan to
cooperate to promote authorized software sales and fight the spread
of copyright piracy in China, the companies announced Friday.
	   Under the terms of a five-year agreement, Founder will develop
an electronic publishing system and other applications based on
Microsoft's Windows NT Server and BackOffice Server programs.
Microsoft will offer marketing and technical support for these
applications and supervise authenticity tests.
	   Executives from both companies said stamping out software piracy
is a prerequisite for the development of China's software industry.
	   Executives from Microsoft, the world's largest software maker,
did not provide specific figures on how much is lost each year from
software piracy in China.
	   ``There is piracy in the U.S., but not as severe as China,''
said Pieter Knook, vice president of Microsoft's Far East region.
``It is clear that software piracy in China is damaging.''
	   Founder, one of China's leading software companies, said the
company suffers anywhere from 40 million to 80 million yuan (dlrs 5
million to dlrs 10 million) each year in lost sales due to piracy.
	   ``We want to build an environment where conditions are
sustainable for software development and companies like Founder can
get a return on their investment,'' Knook added.

estimates that unlicensed software costs makers dlrs 1.5 billion in
China each year. According to the alliance, almost 98 percent of

Estrada forms commission to study amendments to constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada took the
first step Friday toward changing the 11-year-old constitution,
written after the ouster of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, by
creating a commission to study possible amendments.
	   In a presidential order, Estrada created a commission that will
recommend changes to the 1987 constitution, saying it needs to be
``attuned to the heartbeat of the times.''
	   The commission was told to complete its work by June 30, 1999.
	   It will be composed of up to 25 people, including three retired
members of the Supreme Court and the heads of the committees on
constitutional amendments of the Senate and the House of
Representatives.
	   Constitutional amendments can be proposed by a vote of
two-thirds of the members of Congress or by an elected
constitutional convention. The proposed amendments or revisions
must be approved in a plebiscite.
	   The constitution, ratified in 1987, a year after Marcos' ouster,
limits presidents to a single six-year term to prevent
dictatorships.
	   Many groups, including Roman Catholic Church leaders, have
opposed attempts to open the charter to changes in the past,
fearing this could endanger its democratic provisions.
	   Estrada said earlier this week that he wants to change a clause
that prohibits foreigners from owning land in the Philippines
because it discourages investors and prevents the development of
idle land.
	   He also favors changes that would provide for senators to be
elected by region instead of nationally to assure more
representation for provinces.
	   A former town mayor, Estrada favors increasing the current
maximum three three-year terms for local officials to three
four-year terms, saying that would allow officials to accomplish
more.

Chinese auto executive sentenced to death for embezzlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ The former head of a state-owned Chinese
automaker has been sentenced to death for embezzling more than 55
million yuan (dlrs 7 million), the company said Friday.
	   Huang Peiyu, former chairman of Xiamen Motor Co., was convicted
of selling part of the government's stake in his company and
diverting the money to a foreign bank account.
	   Huang's sentence was suspended for two years, and his life might
be spared if no other irregularities are found, said a spokeswoman
for the company. She said Huang may appeal.
	   The sentence comes just a week after another major stock-market
fraud case. Senior managers of Chengdu Hongguang Industrial Co.
were charged with reporting false profits and misappropriating more
than 165 million yuan (dlrs 20 million).
	   The prosecutions highlight Chinese efforts to root out
corruption that threatens to damage the economy and hurt small
investors.
	   Xiamen Motor said that from 1993 to 1996, Huang used a Hong Kong
subsidiary to sell part of the company to a foreign buyer,
diverting the proceeds to a personal bank account in the Cayman
Islands, a banking center in the Caribbean.
	   Those transactions put 25 percent of the government-owned
company into the hands of a Hong Kong investor.
	   Huang returned some of the money after he was arrested in 1997.

Singapore denies involvement in U.N.-World Bank initiative for
</HEADLINE>
Myanmar

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Friday denied a report it was
involved in an initiative by the World Bank and United Nations to
offer dlrs 1 billion in aid to Myanmar if its military regime
begins talks with the opposition.
	   A Singapore foreign ministry spokesman said that ``neither the
World Bank nor the United Nations has approached Singapore
regarding the proposal to offer development assistance to
Myanmar.''
	   A report Thursday in the International Herald Tribune said
Singapore would provide some of the funds for Myanmar, though the
bulk of the money would come from Japan.
	   Singapore is ``puzzled by reports that (it) is expected to
contribute to funds that would be funneled to Myanmar through the
World Bank,'' said the spokesman.
	   The U.N.-World Bank initiative comes amid a deepening standoff
between pro-democracy activists and the government. Myanmar, also
known as Burma, has been ruled since 1962 by the military.

Singapore Telecom reports higher net earnings in first six months
</HEADLINE>
of 1998

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. on Friday
reported higher net earnings for the first six months of the fiscal
year, but predicted a fall in profit for the second half of the
year.
	   The group's net earnings in the first half of the fiscal year
1999, ending Sept. 30, rose to 997.6 million Singapore dollars
(dlrs 604 million), a 3.4 percent increase over the same period a
year earlier.
	   The telecommunications group said a worse outcome is expected in
the second half of the year, ending with March 1999.
	   ``The results of the group for the second half year are ...
expected to be weaker. However, improved contributions are expected
from overseas investments,'' it said.
	   The group said its pretax profit dropped 6.6 percent to 1.24
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 751 million) for the first half of
fiscal 1999, while revenue was up 4.6 percent to 2.49 billion
Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.5 billion).
	   SingTel added that a 10.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.3
billion) package of corporate cost cuts approved by the government
this week will bring net savings and rebates of 65 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 39 million).

Asian stock markets close generally lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
lower Friday, with prices falling both in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
	   Bucking the trend was the Manila stock exchange, where the key
index surged after the government announced that the Philippine
economy had avoided recession by expanding slightly in the third
quarter of 1998.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 138.38
points, or 0.91 percent, to close at 15,069.39. On Thursday, it
rose 134.30 points, or 0.89 percent.
	   Traders said heavy selling by Japanese corporations anxious to
raise cash was able to offset buying from individual and foreign
investors, traders said.
	   Investors shrugged off news reports that Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa plans to leave the Cabinet and resign his post as head of
a major ruling party faction.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.86 yen in
mid-afternoon trading, up 0.94 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also higher than its late London level of 122.25 yen overnight.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly lower in light
trading. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 36.81 points, or 0.3
percent, closing at 10,742.11.
	   After the market closed, the government announced that Hong
Kong's Gross Domestic Product shrank by about 7 percent during the
third quarter, following a 5.2 percent contraction in the second
quarter.
	   Philippine shares surged after the government said the country's
economy expanded in the third quarter by 0.8 percent from a year
earlier, defying the pessimistic outlook of most economists.
	   The latest data place the country's GNP at 0.8 percent for the
first nine months, and gross domestic products at 0.2 percent.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose
54.43 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,975.36, its highest since June
2.
	   Thai share prices fell 2.4 percent amid continued selling in
banking, finance and property sectors. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index fell 9.11 points to 373.09.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking following
Thursday's sharp gains. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index
fell 57.74 points, or 0.78 percent, to 7,320.12.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with brokers
saying a resurgence of buying interest in Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand boosted local market sentiment. The benchmark NZSE-40
Capital Index rose 23.47 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,985.82.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly lower. The All
Ordinaries Index closed at 2771.3, down just 0.7 point.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index edged up 0.41 point to 447.00.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices close generally little
changed. The benchmark Composite Index slipped 0.16 point to
498.08.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher in directionless trading.
The benchmark Straits Times Index rose 4.06 points, or 0.29
percent, to 1,394.76.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Composite Index fell 2.358, or 0.6 percent, to 392.320.

Rugova says talks on Kosovo not far off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, as
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and European
envoys for Kosovo, planned to meet in the capital Pristina to
discuss the international initiative in Kosovo and meet foreign
observers based in the province.
	   Hill has been trying to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to
both Serbs and Albanians, but so far his ideas have been rejected
by Serbia and only cautiously supported by ethnic Albanian
politicians.
	   The two sides' positions over Kosovo are still far apart. Serbia
wants to keep the province, which it considers the cradle of its
statehood, firmly under its control. The majority ethnic Albanians
want independence.
	   But Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the Albanians' independence
movement, said at a news conference in Pristina, that ``we are not
far from political negotiations.''
	   Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some progress in
U.S.-led efforts to bring the two sides closer together. There are
fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh fighting by spring if those
efforts fail.
	   Rugova said talks ``should be well-prepared.'' He dismissed
attempts by Serbia to organize talks without international
involvement as ``a well-known show.'' Rugova said Hill supported
his stand.
	   Serbian officials earlier this week tried to push forward their
own peace plan which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia with a
form of self-rule.
	   Hill has discussed his plan with ethnic Albanian rebels, whose
support is crucial. Ethnic Albanian sources have said that Kosovo
Liberation Army representatives would present Hill soon with their
written remarks on the draft.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   Petritsch, who is Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia, on
Thursday visited a suspected mass grave site in central Kosovo,
accompanied by the leader of an EU team of forensic experts that
intends to examine six such sites around the province.

More than 1,500 people ill in Ukraine's flooded region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Doctors have diagnosed more than 1,500 ill
people, most suffering respiratory illnesses, during health
checkups the past two days in a flood-stricken region of western
Ukraine, officials said Friday.
	   This month, more than 32,000 people have fallen ill, some with
infectious diseases that still might be spreading, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said Friday.
	   Health officials are still worried about the spread of
illnesses, saying much of the region's drinking water was polluted
by the flooding.
	   The floods hit more than 100 settlements, mostly in the
Zakarpattia region, and claimed at least 17 lives, emergency
officials said Thursday.
	   More than 2,000 houses were fully destroyed in the flooding and
thousands of people were evacuated from the area.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the relief effort. International organizations
including the Red Cross and United Nations have sent aid.
	   Aid also came from the governments and non-government groups in
Poland, Switzerland, Britain, the United States, Austria, Germany,
Slovenia, France, the Czech Republic, Holland and China.
	   Hungary has provided about dlrs 500,000 in aid and more than
dlrs 200,000 came from Japan, according to the Ukrainian
government.

Hong Kong sinks deeper into recession

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has sunk even deeper into recession,
the government said Friday in a report that cast a gloomy outlook
on the territory's economic performance for the year.
	   Gross domestic product fell by about 7 percent in the third
quarter, prompting government economists to predict the economy
will contract by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   The government had previously predicted the economy would shrink
by 4 percent. Hong Kong's GDP had fallen by 5.2 percent in the
second quarter and 2.7 percent in the first quarter.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang warned there could be more
tough times ahead, saying Hong Kong people would have to ``cross a
psychological barrier'' as they prepare to ride things out.
	   ``We may have to face a couple of more quarters of poor
figures,'' Tsang told a press conference.
	   Government economists blamed Hong Kong's troubles on volatile
financial markets, tight credit and high interest rates _ all of
which have aggravated its problems from Asia's downturn.
	   The government added that Hong Kong's inflation rate would slow
for the full year, with rises in consumer prices dropping to 3
percent from 3.5 percent.
	   Hong Kong ``was spending less'' in the third quarter, amid
uncertainty over a steep drop in stocks and property prices, said
economist Anthony Xie of U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
	   ``That the contraction accelerated so much is kind of
surprising,'' said Xie. But he predicted Hong Kong's economy would
``stabilize by the middle of 1999.''
	   Hong Kong trade suffered ``a significant setback'' in the third
quarter and is expected to remain weak into the fourth quarter, due
to the continued economic slump in Japan and the rest of Asia, the
government said.
	   For the full year, total exports of goods will drop by 4.5
percent, compared with the previous forecast of a 2.2 percent fall.
Imports will drop 6.4 percent, compared with the previous estimate
of a 3.5 percent fall, the government said.
	   Tsang said the big drop in Hong Kong's economic performance
appeared somewhat exaggerated, because the third quarter figures
had to be compared with numbers from the previous third quarter,
when the territory had a ``brilliant performance.''
	   Tsang tried to stay as optimistic as possible under the
circumstances, noting recent rises in stock and property prices and
urging Hong Kong people to compare their current plight with the
greater economic devastation being suffered by many of their Asian
neighbors.
	   Hong Kong has taken a battering of bad economic news in recent
months. Early this month the government announced that unemployment
hit a record 5.3 percent _ the highest since the territory began
keeping unemployment statistics in 1981.
	   In a random telephone survey conducted this month by Hong Kong
University of more than 500 respondents, 58 percent said they had
no confidence in the way the government was handling the recession.
	   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent.

Woods stands six shots back in Casio World Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBUSUKI, Japan (AP) _ Tiger Woods, in his first Japan PGA Tour
tournament, shot a 2-over-par 74 Friday to stand six shots behind
second-round leader Hidemichi Tanaka in the Casio World Open.
	   Woods, top-ranked in the world, chipped in from 40 yards for
birdie on the first but bogeyed four straight holes from No. 6. He
birdied the final hole en route to a 1-under 143 total.
	   Despite his lackluster round, Woods drew the biggest crowds and
biggest cheers from the more than 5,000 spectators.
	   Japan Open champion Tanaka fired a 69 with four birdies and a
bogey for 7-under 137 at the 7,105-yard (6,467-meter), par-72
Ibusuki Golf Club course.
	   Overnight leader Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, the youngest of three
Ozaki brothers on the Japan tour, shot a 71 to share second place
at 138 with Toshimitsu Izawa, who turned in a 69.
	   American Brian Watts, runner-up at the British Open, went around
in 70 to stand tied for fourth at 139 with compatriot Paul
Stankowski and Nobumitsu Yuhara.
	   The 150 million yen (dlrs 1.25 million) event offers a top prize
of 27 million yen (dlrs 225,000).

At least two immigrants die in boat collision off Italy's southern
</HEADLINE>
shores &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRINDISI, Italy (AP) _ A motor boat apparently driven by
smugglers crashed into a dinghy filled with would-be immigrants
Friday, killing at least two people.
	   Another five would-be immigrants, including a small child, were
missing and feared dead.
	   Ten others managed to swim to a nearby oil platform and were
later taken ashore by the coast guard. Three of them were
hospitalized for exposure.
	   Initial reports said the immigrants were Albanian, and had
crossed the Mediterranean on their dinghy during the night. The
accident occurred about 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the
southern port of Brindisi.
	   The smugglers, who were unhurt, sped away from the scene
immediately after the collision, the reports said.
	   Also Friday, police blocked some 240 would-be immigrants who
arrived on dinghies along the coastline of the Puglia region, at
the heel of the Italian peninsula.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants fleeing persecution or war at
home have reached Italy's shores in recent years. The immigrants,
most of them Kurds, Northern Africans or Kosovo refugees, usually
pay smugglers huge fees for the trip.

Russian government to cut taxes, hoping to improve compliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government announced plans Friday to cut
taxes, part of its overall strategy of improving tax collections
and pumping some life into the country's moribund economy.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told government officials that
the value-added tax would be cut from 20 percent to 14 percent in
1999, and the tax on profits would be cut from 35 percent to 30
percent.
	   ``These measures help expand the base for taxation,'' the
premier said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. He added that
the VAT cut should be especially popular, since it will lower the
cost of electricity and other consumer expenses.
	   The tax cuts will serve as a foundation for the government's
proposed 1999 budget, Primakov said. He said the government plans
to cut the VAT further to 10 percent in 2000.
	   Tax collection has been a major problem for the Russian
government, and critics have long said the government encouraged
tax cheating by setting its rates too high. As a result, the
government has lacked money to pay wages, provide services and
repay its debts.
	   Some economists have said Russia's short-sighted tax policy
helped set in motion the cash crunch that led the government to
devalue the ruble and default on its foreign loans in August. Those
actions set off a banking crisis that plunged the country into
economic turmoil.
	   ITAR-Tass reported Friday that Central Bank Chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko will head a recently unveiled agency for restructuring
the country's ailing banks.
	   The state-controlled Agency for Restructuring Credit
Organizations will issue stabilization credits and take over stakes
in viable commercial banks that are scheduled for restructuring.
	   It will also oversee liquidation of troubled banks that won't
qualify for restructuring.
	   Most Russian banks have been on the brink of bankruptcy or faced
severe liquidity problems since the government defaulted on its
treasury debt in August.

Alusuisse and Viag merge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Alusuisse-Lonza Group Ltd (Algroup),
Switzerland's biggest aluminum group, and Germany's Viag industrial
concern announced Friday they would merge.
	   The deal, rumored for a week, will create a group with around 53
billion German marks (dlrs 31 billion) in annual sales and 40
billion marks (dlrs 23.5 billion) in market value.
	   The new holding company will be based in Viag's headquarters in
the southern German city of Munich. Some 2,500 jobs _ two percent
of the 127,000 workforce _ will be lost over three years, mainly
through early retirement.
	   Viag shareholders will get 65 percent of the new concern's
shares under a share swap. The company is involved in energy,
chemicals, packaging and telecommunications and employs 95,000
workers.
	   At a press conference in Zurich, the companies stressed that it
was a merger of equals.
	   Viag chief executive officer Wilhelm Simson described it as a
``quantum leap'' in terms of improved competitiveness. He claimed
the two companies will realize 570 million marks (dlrs 335 million)
in annual synergy savings after one-time costs of 400 million marks
(dlrs 235 million).
	   The new company will draw on Viag's position in the energy and
telecommunications sectors and on the strength of Alusuisse in
packaging and speciality chemicals.
	   The merger has to be approved by 90 percent of shareholders.
	   Alusuisse is one of Switzerland's most traditional companies. It
dates back to 1888, when it opened Europe's first aluminum smelter.
	   The company nearly went broke in the 1980s after a series of
disastrous forays in the United States. Then, Swiss banks came to
the company's rescue and recapitalized the company. In the 1990s,
new management brought the company back to life and acquired
packaging companies.
	   Viag was set up as a state concern in 1923. It was privatized in
1986.
	   Alusuisse's Theodor M. Tschopp will be board chairman. Viag's
Simson will be chief executive officer.

France calls on Africa to help take care of itself
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with summit opening, Chirac speech &QL;

 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac officially opened the 20th
French-African summit on Friday with a call for African nations to
do their own peacekeeping -- an abrupt departure from past
practices that put the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Security is the theme of the summit which has drawn 49 African
nations, and 34 heads of state, to Paris until Saturday.
	   Strife-torn Congo took center stage, with all eyes on Congolese
President Laurent-Desire Kabila as he crosses paths with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
Both Rwanda and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency in the
Congo.
	   The Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared to meet with
Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila held out little hope that progress could be made at
the summit, saying a pullout of Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces
from the Congo was a precondition for substantive talks on a peace
settlement.
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France
Internationale, Kabila added that his allies, Angola and Zimbabwe,
``were not pushing (him) to negotiate.''
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks with Chirac on Saturday.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It, naturally, is the
responsibility of Africans themselves,'' Chirac told the gathering.
	   But, ``The reality at the end of 1998 is that a quarter of
sub-Saharan African states are in crisis,'' he said, ``in most
cases, spilling over national borders.''
	   The French president called on African nations to move forward
with a ``collective architecture of security'' with regional and
sub-regional assuring the lion's share of the job.
	   He added that this would not imply an ``erosion of
responsibilities'' by the United Nations or the international
community.
	   France is not an occasional friend of Africa, Chirac said, but
``a long-time, attentive partner.''
	   Since last year, France has moved to redefine its relationship
with Africa after a century as benevolent patriarch across a large
swath of the continent. Former colonies gained prestige and
financial benefits for remaining within Paris' sphere of influence.
	   In 1997 France announced a five-year plan to cut its forces in
Africa from 8,000 to 5,000 and close one of six military bases.
	   The sea-change in French policy is accompanied by a keener
interest by Paris in extending its influence beyond former French
colonies.
	   The guest list at the summit reflects that widening interest.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. Annan and Organization of
African Unity chairman Blaise Campaore of Burkina Faso, whose
presence at the summit is unprecedented, were to address the
gathering.

Taiwan relieved over Jiang's Japan visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Japan-China

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Relieved Taiwanese officials on Friday
cheered Japan's refusal to offer visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin new concessions on Taiwan.
	   Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province that is part of
China. And whether Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered
anything new on the issue during Jiang's visit was being closed
watched.
	   Taiwan welcomed Japan's refusal Thursday to put into writing a
commitment not to support Taiwanese independence or membership in
international organizations reserved for sovereign countries.
	   Instead, Japan reiterated its policy of recognizing Beijing
while maintaining only unofficial relations with Taiwan.
	   Taiwan is ``happy to see Japan pragmatically deal with
reality,'' in not altering its position toward Taiwan, said Sheu
Ke-sheng, a deputy chairman of the cabinet's Mainland Affairs
Council.
	   But Foreign Minister Jason Hu warned Beijing was stepping up
efforts to separate Taiwan from its remaining diplomatic allies,
and attempting to draw overseas Chinese community organizations
away from supporting the island.
	   Taiwan has formed a task force to put out diplomatic fires
wherever they flare up, Hu told reporters.
	   And it is on guard against attempts by China to engineer a
worldwide boycott of celebrations of Taiwan's Oct. 10 national day
on next year's 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China on the mainland, Hu said.
	   Japan ruled Taiwan as a colony for 50 years before 1945, and
they remain close despite the lack of diplomatic ties.
	   China threatens to use force to reassert control over Taiwan,
which separated again from the mainland amid civil war in 1949 and
is recognized by just 27 countries worldwide.

Government proposes package of anti-crime measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government proposed a package of draft
laws Friday aimed at stepping up the fight against crime.
	   The measures, which still face consideration in parliament,
would raise the penalties for arms trafficking and give the
government greater control over private security companies, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   They also would require candidates for public office to provide
more information about themselves and to prove they do not suffer
from alcoholism, mental illness or drug addiction.
	   The measures were introduced at a time when crime is a major
concern in Russia, following last week's shooting death of a
popular member of parliament, Galina Starovoitova. However, the
anti-crime package was apparently being developed before she was
killed.
	   In calling for the stepped-up measures, Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Russian criminal groups have ``become obnoxious,''
and are openly challenging Russian society and government.
	   ``The law enforcement system has accepted the challenge,'' he
said, according to Interfax. He said the latest measures are aimed
at ``eliminating criminal groups ... and freeing the economy of
criminal influence.''

Philippine stocks rise sharply on good 3rd quarter economic data;
</HEADLINE>
index up 2.8 percent
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply
Friday, shaking off earlier lethargy after the release of
better-than-expected third quarter economic data, traders said.
	   The Philippine economy, in terms of gross national product,
expanded in the third quarter by 0.8 percent from a year earlier,
defying the pessimistic outlook of most economists.
	   Gross domestic product, however, which excludes money sent home
by millions of overseas Filipino workers, shrank 0.1 percent.
	   The data put GNP growth at 0.8 percent for the first nine
months, and gross domestic product growth at 0.2 percent.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks soared
54.43 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,975.36, its highest closing
since June 2 this year. The index fell 37.61 points Thursday.
	   The broader All Shares Index rose 13.64 points to 627.28 after a
6.63-point retreat Thursday. Gainers beat losers 86 to 26, while 42
issues were unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. and Metro Pacific Corp.,
which both retreated after Metro Pacific's parent, First Pacific
Co. of Hong Kong, announced its long-awaited takeover of PLDT
earlier this week, were the day's most active stocks.
	   PLDT rose 30 pesos to 1,030 pesos, while Metro Pacific gained 8
centavos to 1.98 pesos.
	   Cilette Liboro, research head of Orion Squire Securities, said
the better-than-expected economic data should push the market index
beyond its immediate resistance of 2,000 points, a level it hasn't
touched since May.
	   ``It appears the economy has already bottomed out, and we should
see some modest recovery in the first half,'' she said.
	   ING Barings economist Joey Cuyegkeng said the economic data
caught many analysts by surprise and proved the economy's
resiliency.
	   He said it should further enhance investor confidence, which has
improved in recent months with developments overseas such as cuts
in U.S. interest rates.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed lower against the U.S.
dollar, weighed down by expectations of weaker Japanese yen and
holiday-shortened trading hours in the United States, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.512 pesos for the day, up from Thursday's
39.462 pesos. It traded in a thin range of 39.450 pesos to 39.580
pesos and last changed hands at 39.455 pesos.
	   The peso continues to track the yen's movements, traders said.
	   The absence of market-moving news, meanwhile, failed to lift the
peso higher. Despite the release of better-than-expected economic
growth figures, the market largely ignored the data.
	   The Philippine Central Bank wasn't active on the spot market. It
held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.500 percent
and 15.500 percent, respectively.
	   Markets will be closed Monday for a holiday.

Bavaria presents initiative to slow immigration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Tapping a growing sentiment that
immigration must be curbed, the conservative state of Bavaria
introduced a measure Friday to reduce the number of foreigners
allowed into the country.
	   Bavarian Justice Minister Alfred Sauter told the upper house of
parliament that a limit on the number of immigrants was ``urgently
needed,'' emphasizing the costs of caring for new immigrants and
asylum-seekers.
	   Many are unemployed long term and rely heavily on social
security, he said.
	   About 9 percent of Germany's 80 million population are
foreigners, and the new center-left government also is concerned
about immigrants adding to the jobless rolls. However, liberals in
the government were angered last week when the new interior
minister, Otto Schily, declared that immigration to Germany was
``over the limit.''
	   Meanwhile, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's expert on Bosnia said
war refugees would be returned to their homeland at a slower pace
next year, citing ongoing difficulties rebuilding the country.
	   ``Stability in Bosnia must take precedence over the return of
refugees,'' Hans Koschnick was quoted as saying in the Berliner
Morgenpost.
	   Koschnick noted that the new defense minister, Rudolf Scharping,
expressed the same opinion after visiting Sarajevo this week.

Ukrainian police officer kills alleged attacker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Authorities in Ukraine's Crimean port of
Sevastopol on Friday released details of a shooting in which the
city's police chief killed one criminal suspect and wounded
another.
	   The city prosecutor's office said Lt. Gen. Vyvat Biloborodov,
the head of Sevastopol's Interior Ministry branch, detained the two
suspects on Wednesday on the outskirts of Sevastopol on suspicion
of theft.
	   The two, who had electric appliances in their possession,
allegedly attacked the general, kicking him and attempting to seize
his pistol. Biloborodov fired in response, killing one of the men
on the spot and seriously wounding the other, said the report,
cited by the independent UNIAN news agency.
	   The prosecutor's office said it launched a criminal
investigation into the shooting to determine the circumstances and
whether the general's use of the weapon was justified.

Dutch Santa's Moorish helper gets makeover to avoid offending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Black Pete, the minstrel-like
sidekick to the Dutch version of Santa Claus, is getting a makeover
to make him less offensive to children in ethnically mixed schools.
	   This Christmas season, Black Petes will have to straighten their
corkscrew curls and lose their thick lips before they'll be allowed
into schools in Amsterdam's Bijlmer neighborhood, home to thousands
of Africans and other immigrants, the daily De Telegraaf reported
Friday.
	   The traditional Moorish helpers of Sinterklaas _ a Dutch
forerunner of Santa _ have come under fire in recent years for
their exaggerated features. The new ``Sinterklaas Code'' aims to
update their image and make them more acceptable to minorities.
	   It also banishes Black Pete's subservient role to Sinterklaas.
From now on, the two should have ``a relationship based on
equality,'' according to a letter to all primary schools cited by
De Telegraaf.
	   Black Petes often are played by white children transformed into
Spanish ``Moors'' with wigs and painted faces. Discussion about the
racial stereotypes they perpetuate have become as much part of
Sinterklaas festivities as handing out gifts.
	   According to tradition, Sinterklaas arrives by boat in his red
bishop's mantle and miter and rides a white horse over rooftops,
tossing toys down chimneys.
	   On Dec. 5, the eve of St. Nicholas' feast day, Sinterklaas,
helped by Black Petes, visits schools bearing gifts and candies. As
children gather, he opens his ``Big Book'' to check who's been
naughty or nice.

Rugova says talks on Kosovo not far off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, as
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and European
envoys for Kosovo, planned to meet in the capital Pristina to
discuss the international initiative in Kosovo and meet foreign
observers based in the province.
	   Hill wants a peace deal acceptable to Serbs and Albanians, but
so far his ideas have been rejected by Serbia and only cautiously
supported by ethnic Albanian politicians.
	   The two sides' positions over Kosovo are still far apart. Serbia
wants to keep the province, which it considers the cradle of its
statehood, firmly under its control. The majority ethnic Albanians
want independence.
	   But Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the Albanians' independence
movement, said at a news conference in Pristina, that ``we are not
far from political negotiations.''
	   Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some progress in
U.S.-led efforts to bring the two sides closer together. There are
fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh fighting by spring if those
efforts fail.
	   Rugova said talks ``should be well-prepared.'' He dismissed
attempts by Serbia to organize talks without international
involvement as ``a well-known show.'' Rugova said Hill supported
his stand.
	   Serbian officials earlier this week tried to push forward their
own peace plan which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia with a
form of self-rule.
	   Hill has discussed his plan with ethnic Albanian rebels, whose
support is crucial. Ethnic Albanian sources have said that Kosovo
Liberation Army representatives would present Hill soon with their
written remarks on the draft.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   Petritsch, who is Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia, on
Thursday visited a suspected mass grave site in central Kosovo,
accompanied by the leader of an EU team of forensic experts that
intends to examine six such sites around the province.

in London &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet is receiving psychiatric
care for stress-related disorders, which his lawyers might cite in
a bid to have the former Chilean dictator found mentally unfit to
stand trial, The Times reported in Friday's editions.
	   Pinochet, who faces the threat of extradition to Spain on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his
17-year regime, remains under police guard at a London hospital,
where he is recovering from back surgery earlier this month.
	   ``He is undergoing assessment for stress and stress-related
disorders,'' The Times quoted an unidentified ``highly placed
medical source'' as saying. ``It is well documented that elderly
people frequently react badly to stress.''
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook agreed to meet Chilean Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Insulva in London on Friday on the
understanding that Pinochet's fate was legal matter, not a
political issue, the Foreign Office said.

Indonesian students protest against military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student demonstrators shouted
anti-military slogans outside a police station Friday in protest of
the Nov. 13 fatal shooting of nine students by Indonesian troops.
	   The students were slain while protesting a government assembly
that activists feared would only bring about inadequate democratic
reforms. The assembly was supposed to dismantle the authoritarian
legacy of former President Suharto.
	   On Friday, some 200 students marched peacefully along a toll
road to the Jakarta metropolitan police headquarters, the site of
several large demonstrations earlier this month.
	   ``Police are criminals,'' they shouted. Riot officers blocked
them from marching onward toward Parliament.
	   The Indonesian police force falls under the command of armed
forces commander Gen. Wiranto, but the government is exploring ways
to make the police independent from the military.
	   Indonesia's student movement helped oust Suharto in May after
three decades in power, and protesters have tried to march several
times to the former army general's house.
	   The students believe B.J. Habibie, the new president, is
stalling needed reforms. They also want the government to try
Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Students have also focused their anger on the military since
police and soldiers fired on protesters.
	   Wiranto had ordered troops to carry only blanks and plastic
bullets, but hospital doctors said they found fragments of metal
bullets in some of the victims.
	   Army officials confined 163 security personnel to barracks for
three weeks and said they could face courts-martial for violating
proper procedures in the nighttime clash two weeks ago.

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ In Hindu mythology, Krishna is worshipped
as a brave warrior against evil, but also as a rascally
flute-playing cowherd who seduces village women.
	   Snehlata Rajput was enchanted by tales of Krishna from
childhood. On Thursday, she took the unusual step of marrying him _
or at least, a portrait of the god.
	   As priests chanted ancient Sanskrit hymns, the 45-year-old
physician draped a garland of marigolds, gladioli and peacock
feathers, and received garlands in return from devotees of the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known as
Hare Krishnas.
	   Priest Mohan Das declared Krishna and Snehlata man and wife
after a 90-minute ceremony, during which the 250 invitees sang
religious songs and danced to the beat of drums.
	   ``This is a unique marriage,'' said Ratneesh Singh, her nephew.
``This was her desire for 25 years and ultimately her dream has
come true. We respect her wishes.''
	   Snehlata, a doctor at a government hospital in the city of
Kanpur, says she fell in love with Krishna when she was 15.
According to her nephew, Sanjay Kumar, she claimed to have had
several visions of Krishna. ``Since then she decided to devote her
life to Lord Krishna and said she would marry him.''
	   A few days ago, Snehlata bought herself expensive silk saris,
gold bangles, ear rings and necklaces. She got silk clothes for her
``husband'' _ through the ISCON temple _ and even invested in a new
bed and linen.
	   On Thursday night, ISCON members came in a procession with the
``groom'' to her house. The bride, dressed in a gold-and-red silk
sari, stepped onto a dais erected outside. She joined the others in
singing, then wore a chain with Krishna pendant.
	   Only weeks earlier, she rejected a proposal from a real-life
doctor named Krishna, as she had turned down several other marriage
offers in the past.
	   Krishna is an incarnation of protector god Vishnu and is one of
the most widely worshipped of all the Hindu gods. He is the central
figure in the Gita, the popular epic poem that lays down the ethics
of a good Hindu.

Federations seek common ground on doping sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with consensus reached on sanctions; other details;
edits to conform and trim; will be updated at end of meeting
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic sports federations reached
apparent consensus Friday on imposing mininum two-year suspensions
on athletes found guilty of using banned drugs.
	   But FIFA, world soccer's governing body, expressed reservations
about the penalties, and the international cycling federation said
two-year bans would never stand up in court.
	   Leaders of 35 international sports federations met with
International Olympic Committee officials Friday in a bid to
strengthen the battle against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The IOC wants the 28 summer and seven winter federations to
endorse common rules, procedures and sanctions to cleanse the
sports world of steroids and other banned substances.
	   IOC leaders are intent on getting the federations to fall into
line before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit in Lausanne.
	   During a break in Friday's meetings, delegates said there was
general agreement on most major issues _ including a minimum
two-year sanction for a first offense involving steroids or other
serious drugs.
	   At present, IOC guidelines recommend a two-year ban as a maximum
punishment. In some cases, different federations apply different
sanctions for the same offense.
	   ``It seems like there's consensus for two years right now,''
said Gunnar Werner, secretary of the international swimming
federation.
	   IOC medical commission chairman Prince Alexandre de Merode said
officials were also debating additional sanctions, including
financial penalties and disqualification from certain events.
	   Delegates from FIFA, which has resisted IOC doping dictates for
several years, voiced reservations on grounds that certain drugs
covered by the two-year penalty have no performance-enhancing
benefits for soccer players.
	   Werner said there were moves to find a formula allowing more
flexibility on the two-year penalty to accomodate certain sports.
	   ``In cycling, a two-year ban is like a life ban,'' he said. ``In
other sports like swimming and track and field, the athletes can
still come back.''
	   The international cycling union, whose sport was damaged by
revelations of systematic doping during the Tour de France, voiced
no objections during the debate.
	   UCI president Hein Verbruggen said he would go along with a
two-year sanction. But he said the penalty won't serve much use
because it won't be accepted by the legal system.
	   ``The rules have to be in line with what is acceptable to the
courts,'' he said. ``If we go to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport, they will never give two years. It's the priority of law.
You have to look at the consequences.''
	   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, said
sports should be kicked out of the Olympics if they can't accept a
minimum two-year ban.
	   ``I think athletes in each sport should get the same sanction
for the same offense,'' he said. ``There should not be any
flexibiliy in the two years, except for the possibility of
additional penalties. If sports can't accept this, they don't
deserve to be in the Olympic movement.''
	   On another key issue, the federations expressed support for
establishment of an independent doping agency to coordinate drug
testing around the world.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who heads the project, said the
agency could be up and running early next year with initial funding
of dlrs 25 million from Olympic television revenues.
	   Track and field chief Primo Nebiolo challenged the federations
to stop bickering and unite in their efforts to fight doping.
	   ``We have an opportunity to show the outside world that all of
sport is united in its conviction that doping can be faced in a
legitimate and believable way,'' he said.
	   Nebiolo, who also heads the association of all summer Olympic
federations, said the sports bodies must ``go beyond criticizing
each other'' and guard against being ``consumed by our own
individual interests.''
	   Officials said Friday's meeting focused on getting consensus in
principle on several key issues:
	   _ adoption of a unified medical code
	   _ a definition of doping
	   _ uniformity of doping sanctions
	   _ creation of a world anti-doping agency
	   _ cooperation with government institutions
	   _ educational and ethical intitiatives
	   _ protection of athletes' rights
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical
commission, said total harmonization of sanctions is impossible,
calling it ``an intellectual dream.''
	   ``We can't tell the federations what to do,'' he said. ``They
have their autonomy. The IOC can only give guidelines.''

Turkish political rivals signal alliance once again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The two rivals of Turkish politics have
signaled a willingness to put aside their animosity and join in an
alliance to govern Turkey until elections in April, reports said
Friday.
	   Party leaders are engaged in intense negotiations to form a new
government since Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz'
17-month-old government in a no-confidence vote Wednesday over a
mafia scandal.
	   No party has a majority to govern alone in the deeply fragmented
Parliament, and an alliance between pro-secular parties that would
exclude a pro-Islamic party is a must to avoid a possible
confrontation with the military.
	   Both Yilmaz and his political rival, former premier Tansu
Ciller, declared themselves ready to cooperate. Mrs. Ciller on
Thursday declared herself ``open to proposals.''
	   ``We can move together in certain issues,'' the Milliyet
newspaper quoted Yilmaz as saying Friday.
	   President Suleyman Demirel was expected to conclude
consultations with party leaders to piece together a coalition on
Friday.
	   The first signs of a possible cooperation came last week when
both Mrs. Ciller and Yilmaz had their parties block corruption
probes into each other.
	   Both head center-right parties with similar ideologies. Their
animosity stems from a struggle to win ground among the same
electorate.
	   A 1996 alliance broke up after only three months when Yilmaz'
party backed a corruption inquiry into Mrs. Ciller.
	   However, neither has enough votes to sustain a majority and
would need the backing of a third party. Bulent Ecevit, who is the
deputy premier in the caretaker government, made it clear Thursday
that the two parties could count on his support.
	   Yilmaz remains caretaker premier until a new government is
formed.
	   In a move to avoid a standoff with the military, the pro-Islamic
party said Thursday it would not insist on his rightful chance to
lead the next government. The job of forming a new government
normally falls on the leader of Virtue as the largest party in
Parliament. But the staunchly secular military, which has pressured
Turkey's first Islamic-led government out of power, would oppose
such a move.
	   ``For many people the alternative of a government including
Virtue is the military,'' commented columnist Ismet Berkan of the
daily Radikal on Friday, referring to a possible coup.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.

South Korea to develop anti-ship and portable missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will develop a dlrs 78
million anti-ship missile system by 2003, the Defense Ministry said
Friday.
	   Until now, virtually all of South Korea's missile systems have
been imported, mostly from the United States.
	   The new guided missile will have a range of at least 100
kilometers (62 miles), the ministry said.
	   South Korea has also started research on developing a portable
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile system with a range of 3 to 5
kilometers (2 to 3 miles), it said.
	   South Korea maintains a vigorous arms buildup program as a
deterrent against communist North Korea.
	   The missile plans were included in an announcement Friday, in
which the government budgeted dlrs 29 million in new weapons and
military research.
	   It was one of several military spending packages the country
announces each year.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Japanese
legislators Friday that history plays an important role in
determining bilateral relations and hinted Tokyo has not yet done
enough to atone for World War II. On the first state visit by a
Chinese head of state to Japan, Jiang met Thursday with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and received a spoken apology _ first issued
in 1995 _ for Japan's brutal World War II invasion of China. But
the joint written declaration that was expected to include an
unambiguous Japanese apology merely said Japan was ``conscious of
its responsibility'' for suffering caused to the Chinese people. At
a meeting with Japanese legislators on Friday, Jiang touched on the
issue, referring to history as a ``mirror'' that was important for
the future of relations. Japanese media also reported that Jiang
expressed his disappointment by agreeing with opposition leader
Naoto Kan that the statement did not go far enough to express
Japanese remorse. (JAPAN-CHINA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian dissident on trial
on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct grabbed and waved
the photograph presented as evidence Friday to show it merely
captured three people looking into the camera. Prosecutors entered
a photograph of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and one
of his alleged mistresses, the wife of his secretary, as evidence
in the trial, now in its 15th day. Anwar says he is innocent of all
charges, which he says are part of a conspiracy by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to unseat his former protege because Anwar was
becoming too popular. Anwar has been accused of abusing his powers
to force police to arrest and obtain retractions from those who had
accused him of sodomy and adultery. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, hospitalized with
pneumonia, is capable of performing his duties until the end of his
term in 2000, a senior Kremlin official said Friday, citing
presidential doctors. ``We trust the doctors whose job it is to
take care of the president,'' Oleg Sysuyev, the president's first
deputy chief of staff, told the Interfax news agency. He dismissed
suggestions that early presidential elections should be held next
fall at the same time as parliamentary elections, saying that would
destabilize the nation. Meanwhile, the government announced plans
Friday to cut taxes, part of its strategy of improving tax
collections and pumping some life into the moribund economy. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov told government officials that the
value-added tax would be cut from 20 percent to 14 percent in 1999,
and the tax on profits would be cut from 35 percent to 30 percent.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, as
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to resolve the crisis. Christopher Hill and Wolfgang
Petritsch, the U.S. and European envoys for Kosovo, planned to meet
in the capital, Pristina, to discuss the international initiative
in Kosovo and meet foreign observers based in the province. Ibrahim
Rugova, the leader of the Albanians' independence movement, said at
a news conference in Pristina that ``we are not far from political
negotiations.'' Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some
progress in U.S.-led efforts to bring the two sides closer
together. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

Anwar's friend accuses police of torment

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A speech writer for ousted deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim says he lied about having sex with his
boss after police beat him, threatened to harm his family and
humiliated him with sexual taunts.
	   According to a 55-page affidavit obtained by The Associated
Press, Munawar Ahmad Anees, 50, said that while in custody he was
deprived of food and medicine and led to believe that his wife and
two children would be harmed if he didn't say he had sex with
Anwar.
	   In the document filed Nov. 7 in Sessions Court, Munawar
recounted how police forced him to simulate homosexual acts with
the sacked finance minister.
	   ``I had little choice but to groan and moan as my captors wanted
me to,'' Munawar wrote, describing repeated police interrogations
after his arrest on Sept. 14.
	   ``They were bullies and I was in their hands. As I acted out the
demeaning, humiliating parts they gave me, they laughed and asked
if it was good.''
	   Munawar, along with Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Dermawan, 37,
were sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty on Sept.
19 to allowing themselves to be sodomized by Anwar.
	   A day later, police arrested Anwar, who faces trial on 10 counts
of corruption and sexual misconduct, two involving Sukma and
Munawar.
	   Munawar has since retracted his guilty plea and is appealing his
conviction. His appeal is scheduled to be heard Dec. 8.
	   Police on Friday said they could not comment on Munawar's
allegations because the case was still in the courts.
	   ``The doctor says he suffered psychological trauma and shock
after what the police did to him,'' Munawar's wife, Fatima Belhadi,
40, told the AP.
	   Munawar is now a patient at the National Heart Institute after
suffering a heart attack while in custody, his wife said.
	   ``Sometimes he falls into deep depression. He still can't sleep
at night,'' she said.
	   In the court documents, Munawar accused police of invading his
house Sept. 14 without a search warrant, then arresting him without
informing him of his offense.
	   He said police handcuffed him, ransacked his house and
confiscated computer disks, tax returns and family photographs.
	   An officer later told him that he had been arrested under the
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without
trial.
	   ``He just told me that I was a threat to Malaysia,'' Munawar
said in the affidavit. ``I could not understand this at all as I
have never in all my years in Malaysia involved myself in anything
that could be described as a threat to the country.''
	   After he was brought to the federal police headquarters, Munawar
said the police forced him to strip naked and shaved him bald. He
was detained in an 8-by-8 foot (240 centimeter by 240 centimeter)
cell.
	   His guards told him that from now on, his name would be ``No.
26.''
	   ``One of the two swung me around and punched me in the stomach
and said that he was `Mr. Nice Guy' and that I was `Dr. Feel
Good,''' Munawar said in the affidavit.
	   A Pakistani by birth, Munawar also has permanent residence in
the United States, or green card, as well as in Malaysia.
	   According to his wife, he lectured in Islamic sciences at the
University of Chicago for four years during the 1980s.
	   Munawar said police threatened to work with ``U.S. agents'' to
revoke his green card and ruin his plans to apply for U.S.
citizenship.
	   If he confessed, the police promised him freedom, Malaysian
citizenship, a pick of plum jobs and most of all, safety for his
family.
	   ``They told me that I had to understand their difficulties
because Anwar's people were now my enemies and that they would try
to burn my house down and to hurt me and my family,'' he said.

Romania fascist legionnaires to mark anniversary of leader's death

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ About 200 former members of Romania's
Iron Guard will mark the 60th anniversary of their leader's death
in likely the biggest fascist turnout in recent times here, an
organizer said Friday.
	   Relatives of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu known as ``the Captain''
who led the pro-Hitler group from 1927-38 called on followers to
attend an Orthodox Christian feast to mark his death Saturday.
	   The Legionnaires terrorized Romania during World War II, killing
a few political leaders, including two premiers. They tried to
seize power in 1941 but their revolt was quelled.
	   Under communism, which ended in 1989 in Romania, mere mention of
the movement was strictly forbidden. Romania's current constitution
outlaws communist and Legionnaire organizations.
	   In recent years, there has been a revival in the fascist
movement. Books and magazines have attempted to exonerate the
Legionnaires.
	   Codreanu, a lawyer, was killed in 1938 on the orders of King
Carol II in a forest near Bucharest. Carol's henchmen also killed
three of Codreanu's brothers.
	   ``During communism young people did not learn real history,''
said Catalin Zelea Codreanu, 87, the captain's brother, who is
organizing the meeting. He says the Iron Guard was a positive
nationalist movement which gradually degenerated.
	   Communists arrested him in 1945 and he was imprisoned for 17
years for his anti-Soviet stance.
	   He said his brother was ``a great man who deeply loved his
country and that's why he was killed.''
	   Romania's pro-Nazi wartime leader, Marshal Ion Antonescu,
outlawed the Legionnaires in 1941 after they tried to oust him in a
coup.
	   Romania was allied with Nazi Germany during the war until King
Michael helped stage a coup against Antonescu in August 1944 taking
Romania over to the Allies.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
lower Friday, with prices falling both in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
Bucking the trend was the Manila stock exchange, where the key
index surged after the government announced that the Philippine
economy had avoided recession by expanding slightly in the third
quarter of 1998. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 138.38 points, or 0.91 percent, to close at 15,069.39. The
U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.86 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up
0.94 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late
London level of 122.25 yen overnight. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index
fell 36.81 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 10,742.11. The
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose 54.43
points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,975.36, its highest since June 2. Thai
share prices fell 2.4 percent amid continued selling in banking,
finance and property sectors. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index
fell 9.11 points to 373.09. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank sharply
lowered its growth forecasts for many countries in Asian on Friday
in response to deepening problems in the past half year, but said
there are signs the financial crisis may be bottoming out. The
growth revisions released by the Manila-based bank starkly show how
sentiment toward a number of Asian countries has dramatically
worsened since its last forecasts in April. The bank said economies
of developing countries in East and Southeast Asia, excluding
China, are expected to contract by an average 3.5 percent this
year, their worst performance since World War II. Economies in
Southeast Asia, the region hardest hit by the crisis, are projected
to shrink by an average 6.9 percent. (ASIA-LOWER GROWTH)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong has sunk even deeper into recession,
the government said Friday in a report that cast a gloomy outlook
on the territory's economic performance for the year. Gross
domestic product fell by about 7 percent in the third quarter,
prompting government economists to predict the economy will
contract by 5 percent for all of 1998. The government had
previously predicted the economy would shrink by 4 percent. Hong
Kong's GDP had fallen by 5.2 percent in the second quarter and 2.7
percent in the first quarter. Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
warned there could be more tough times ahead. Government economists
blamed Hong Kong's troubles on volatile financial markets, tight
credit and high interest rates _ all of which have aggravated its
problems from Asia's downturn. (HONG KONG-RECESSION)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In his most candid remarks yet on the
economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday
that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the
EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1. Despite an area-wide
survey that suggested ``a moderation in the pace of growth,''
Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to boost the economy.
He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market conditions
as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate cuts toward the 3.3
percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries. Duisenberg,
who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 22
meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the
outlook for inflation and the EU economy. (GERMANY-CENTRAL BANK)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Unemployment fell to 11.6 percent in October from
11.7 percent, the Labor Ministry said Friday. The figure reflects a
slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one
of the nation's knottiest problems. The improved figures were
largely due to a gain in jobs by men aged 25 to 49, according to
the Labor Ministry. The October data was better than expectations.
Economists had seen October's unemployment level steady from
September. According to the Labor Ministry and to the national
unemployment agency ANPE, the number of job seekers fell by 9,000,
or 0.3 percent to 2.945 million people. Job seekers aged 25 to 49
were the greatest gainers, with their number falling by 5,400, or
0.6 percent. (FRANCE-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Unions representing Rover workers
have agreed with BMW on a package of job cuts and new investment to
keep the automaker's largest British factory open, the two sides
announced Friday. The agreement, which has to be ratified by
Rover's 39,000 workers, calls for trimming 2,500 jobs and for new
working practices. Rover's Longridge plant near Birmingham, which
now has 14,000 workers, would be saved under the plan. Roger Lyons,
general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union,
said he hoped the job reductions could be achieved through
attrition. BMW suffered heavy losses at Rover, which it acquired
from British Aerospace in 1994. In October, the German company
indicated it wants to eliminate about 2,500 jobs in Britain.

European stock exchange heads meet on creating united market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The heads of nine European stock exchanges were
meeting behind closed doors Friday to discuss how to form a
pan-European stock market that one day could rival Wall Street.
	   No information filtered from the meeting, taking place at the
headquarters of the Societe des Bourses Francaise, which runs the
Paris stock exchange.
	   A statement was expected at the close of the talks, which began
about 11 a.m. (1000 GMT), and could last some six hours.
	   Most European exchanges reacted skeptically _ and some nervously
_ to the announcement this summer of an Anglo-German market by the
London and Frankfurt exchanges.
	   Since then, Paris and smaller European exchanges have realized
that they will be left out if they don't join the movement toward
one big European market. The new European currency, the euro, which
begins Jan. 1, 1999, has also been a major impetus toward the
creation of a pan-European market.
	   Expected to attend the talks were the heads of the exchanges of
Paris, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid,
Stockholm and Zurich.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, at a briefing on
Thursday, told reporters that the Paris Bourse, as the stock
exchange here is known, will be joining the London-Frankfurt
alliance that had been a thorn in France's side.
	   A new European stock-market company could emerge as early as
January, he said -- a surprise announcement that left Paris Bourse
officials, clearly not consulted, trying to water down the
minister's remarks.
	   The reaction reflected skepticism about cobbling together a
pan-European stock exchange any time soon.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ On one side is an intractable
Yugoslav government, executor of a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo. On the other is a fractured Albanian community and an army
of guerrillas ready to relaunch their independence war against the
Serbs.
	   In the middle is a bespectacled American diplomat trying to make
peace and avoid being flattened by the Balkan steamroller.
	   As talks drag on into the cold Kosovo winter _ and the prospect
of renewed warfare in the spring looms ever darker _ chief Albanian
negotiator Fehmi Agani says the logic of compromise has found
unfertile ground here.
	   ``There is another solution,'' he says, not entirely
facetiously. ``The international community gets sick and tired of
these talks and just imposes a settlement. That would be easier.''
	   To a certain extent, it has already done that. Using the threat
of NATO cruise missiles and warplanes, the West forced President
Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on the Albanians, which
killed hundreds, mostly civilians, and displaced an estimated
300,000.
	   Now it is pressing a negotiated settlement, while keeping NATO
poised.
	   With the Yugoslav government refusing to consider any
arrangement that severs the southern province of Kosovo from
Serbia, largest of the two republics in the Yugoslav federation,
and an Albanian side unable to rally behind a single leader and
insisting all negotiations must lead to independence, American
mediator Christopher Hill has his hands full.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, whom the international community has settled
upon as the ethnic Albanian of choice, is not an inspirational
leader and his negotiators, in the eyes of some, are simply out of
touch.
	   Thrown into this mix is the Kosovo Liberation Army, a ragtag
band of guerrillas whose brief uprising this year finally drew the
world's attention to this corner of the Balkans. It stands ready to
sabotage any deal.
	   Time is pressing.
	   ``It's not just the spring offensive, or the fraying of the
cease-fire. I worry about whether political attitudes will harden
still further and whether there will be enough malleability in the
clay to sculpture something,'' Hill said. ``I think we are getting
pretty hard and crusty right now.''
	   Adem Demaci, political representative of the KLA, insists the
differences between Rugova and his more moderate followers in the
LDK party are more of style than substance.
	   ``The KLA is ready to continue to help the peaceful method,'' he
said. ``But the KLA is also preparing to fight.''
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, says the
KLA is rearming and reorganizing and that the politicians only have
a two- to four-month window of relative calm to come to a deal.
	   Demaci insists that if the Serbs ever accept a political
solution for Kosovo, it will be only because they are convinced
Albanians are ready to fight again.
	   Hill has been trying to draw the KLA into the political process
too, but its political organization is every bit as vague as its
military structure. As the American diplomat put it: ``Searching
for the leader of the KLA has been like the search for the
Northwest Passage.''
	   Some KLA commanders in the field think it's too soon to
negotiate, that peace can only come after war.
	   ``My opinion is that should come after the war ends, and the war
hasn't finished,'' said Mensur Kasumi, a KLA sub-regional commander
who referred to the American negotiator as ``President Hill of
Kosovo.''
	   Veton Surroi, publisher of the Albanian-language newspaper Koha
Ditore, says the problem right now is that there is no legitimate
ethnic Albanian leader, nobody supported by a majority in this
province of two million.
	   Nonetheless, Hill recently traveled to the Kosovo countryside
with Rugova and says he was struck by his popularity. ``You and I
may be underwhelmed, but he is a leader.'' Plus, his LDK party is
the only real, structured force.
	   The latest draft of Hill's plan doesn't even mention Serbia,
which the Albanians rather like. The plan would set most power at
the municipal level, leaving the rest to the Yugoslav federation,
omitting mention of the Republic of Serbia. The Serbs have rejected
it and come back with their own plan.
	   ``There is no solution for Kosovo if the area is excluded for
Serbian authorities,'' said Ratko Markovic, a Serb delegation
leader. ``In state territory, nobody has the right ... to create
another state.''
	   Among the big hurdles is dealing with Serbs who want to make
sure Serbs in Kosovo, about 10 percent of the population, are never
ruled by Albanians. Hill is trying to do this tvhrough revamping of
the court system.
	   The other big item on the negotiating plate is the police. Hill
is proposing to organize police at the municipal level, rather that
at Serbian republic level, meaning Albanians and Serbs would
largely police themselves.
	   Agani says the Albanians have proposed a plan where Kosovo would
remain in Yugoslavia for three to five years as a third federation
equal to Serbia, following that with a referendum on independence.
	   ``The real issue has been to try to get them off this
independence kick and on to something that is doable,'' said Hill.
``There is no need for a referendum on independence in Kosovo
because I can tell you right now everyone would support it.
	   ``So why have a referendum? What's the point of waiting for
three years? It would undermine what you are trying to
accomplish.''

Dutch, Italian carriers sign long-term alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Italy's national carrier Alitalia SpA signed an agreement Friday
launching a long-term alliance including cargo and passenger joint
ventures.
	   The alliance, in which KLM and Alitalia are equal partners, aims
to strengthen both airlines' position in intercontinental and
European passenger and cargo routes.
	   At the alliance's official launch, KLM and Alitalia said they
don't intend to take equity positions in each other's company. The
joint ventures will be based on ``sharing of the greater part of
the revenues and costs of the carriers' route networks,'' the
airlines said in a statement.
	   KLM President Leo van Wijk said the passenger joint venture will
have an annual added value of dlrs 380 million, which it will start
generating in three years time, while the cargo one will have an
annual added value of dlrs 65 million.
	   The added value will be created in part by including increased
market share and new flights connecting Italy and the Netherlands,
Van Wijk said.
	   The joint ventures are expected to start sometime in 1999.
	   KLM, which also has a partnership deal with U.S. carrier
Northwest Airlines, said it can terminate the Alitalia alliance if
the Italian airline's privatization is not completed by June 30,
2000.

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Giant cranes untangled piled up train
carriages Friday to uncover more victims _ many of the mangled
beyond recognition _ from the wreckage of a two-train collision,
bringing the number of bodies recovered to 165.
	   At least 10 more bodies were believed buried in the debris, said
S.P. Mehta, a general manager of Indian Railways.
	   Officials said 260 people were injured and about 30 were in
critical condition in hospitals across the northern state of
Punjab. Teams of doctors operated all night, amputating the legs or
hands of some of the victims of Thursday's accident.
	   Rescue workers, fighting the stench of rotting flesh, tore apart
the wreckage to dig out the victims. No survivors have been found
since midday Thursday.
	   ``Many of the bodies are badly mutilated. We may never be able
to identify them,'' said A. K. Kapoor, a top official of the
government-owned railroad company who was supervising the rescue
operations.
	   Work speeded up after the arrival of the huge crane that could
lift an entire train car. Some 5,000 workers, including nearly 200
army soldiers, supported the wobbly wreckage with planks of wood
and steel beams. Others used acetylene torches or crowbars.
	   The workers cleared and opened one of the two railroad tracks
after a 46-hour disruption of traffic on the busy sector, said
Indian Railways official S.P. Mehta at this northern wheat-trading
town, 250 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   The second parallel track also was likely to be cleared later
Friday, Mehta said.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi and had
toppled into the path of the oncoming train on parallel tracks in
pre-dawn mist.
	   A day after the accident, relatives of the victims began
arriving in Khanna to identify their kin. The injured were
scattered in hospitals and medical colleges, depending on their
injuries.
	   For Ram Pravesh the search ended Friday noon. After endless
visits hospitals with local volunteers, he found the body of his
father, Ram Nageena.
	   The 10-year-old boy fainted at the sight of the body on a block
of ice at the local college playground that had been turned into a
makeshift mortuary.
	   Ram Pravesh, a native of Bharukpur village in Uttar Pradesh was
traveling to Punjab to work with his father on a farm. Authorities
sent messengers to his village to inform his mother and sister.
	   India records around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the
largest rail network under one management in the world. Most are
blamed on human error or outdated equipment.
	   Friday's newspapers said safety recommendations are often
ignored in the rush to expand the network, often to please
voters.The government-owned railroad company added 500 trains in
the last four years.
	   The worst accident was three years ago when two trains collided
near New Delhi, killing 358 people.
	   The Indian Express newspaper said a flashing light on the engine
and last coach of the train _ a recommendation of numerous safety
committees _ might have prevented the accident. The government has
said it has little money for better equipment.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track.

More than half Romanians say life was better under communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ More than half of Romanians say life
was better under the iron rule of former communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, according to a poll published Friday.
	   About 51 percent of Romanians said life has worsened since the
downfall of Ceausescu in 1989 while 43 percent said it has
improved, according to the poll published in the Bucharest daily
Adevarul Friday.
	   Only 2 percent said they're happy with life now while 4 percent
said nothing has changed since Ceausescu was ousted and executed,
according to the poll by the Metro Media Transylvania Institute.
	   About 43 percent of the 1,253 citizens polled by telephone
nationwide from Nov. 1-8 said life is now slightly better and 4
percent said it hasn't changed.
	   The poll, requested by the Soros Foundation, has an estimated
margin of error of about 3 percent.
	   Living standards plummeted sharply in Romania in past years as
slow and confused government economic reform lead to high
inflation, unemployment and low foreign investment.
	   Under Ceausescu, all Romanians were guaranteed jobs, mostly in
the country's vast, inefficient industrial sector. Food and other
basic items were scarce as Ceausescu exported most of the nation's
produce to pay off foreign debt in the late 1980s.
	   The poll also showed a growing number of ultranationalist
supporters.
	   The approval rating of ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor,
head of the Greater Romania Party, jumped to 18 percent from 4
percent in 1996 national elections.
	   Liberal free-marketeer President Emil Constantinescu received a
34 percent approval rating in the poll, down from 49 percent in a
poll a year ago.

and 40 billion marks (dlrs 23.5 billion) in market value.
	   The new holding company will be based in Viag's headquarters in
the southern German city of Munich. Some 2,500 jobs _ two percent
of the 127,000 workforce _ will be lost over three years, mainly
through early retirement.
	   Viag shareholders will get 65 percent of the new concern's
shares under a share swap. The company is involved in energy,
chemicals, packaging and telecommunications and employs 95,000
workers.
	   At a news conference in Zurich, Viag chief executive officer
Wilhelm Simson said the two companies will realize 570 million
marks (dlrs 335 million) in annual synergy savings after one-time
costs of 400 million marks (dlrs 235 million).
	   The merger has to be approved by 90 percent of shareholders.
	   Alusuisse dates back to 1888, when it opened Europe's first
aluminum smelter.
	   The company nearly went broke in the 1980s after a series of
disastrous forays in the United States. Then, Swiss banks came to
the company's rescue and recapitalized the company. In the 1990s,
new management brought the company back to life and acquired
packaging companies.
	   Viag was set up as a state concern in 1923. It was privatized in
1986.
	   Alusuisse's Theodor M. Tschopp will be board chairman. Viag's
Simson will be chief executive officer.

Albanians mark 30th anniversary of first pro-independence protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo marked
the 30th anniversary of their first pro-independence demonstrations
in the province on Friday.
	   Some 150 ethnic Albanian intellectuals, former political
prisoners and students attended a ceremony organized in the
institute for Albanian studies in the capital Pristina.
	   Four ethnic Albanians died and hundreds were arrested in 1968
street protests in many Kosovo cities. Kosovo was in Serbia, one of
the six republics in communist-run former Yugoslavia.
	   ``The Albanians then flooded the jails of former Yugoslavia,''
said Adem Demaci, the most prominent former political prisoner and
the spokesman for ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   ``We are in jail now too, except in those territories where our
sons and daughters took up arms and fight for freedom,'' said
Demaci, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army, guerrillas
fighting for independence.
	   Demaci is known as Kosovo's Nelson Mandela for spending 28 years
in former Yugoslavia's prisons.

Adopted children from California return to Korea for visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Erik Reinertsen, a giggly 9-year-old
from Los Angeles, loved the hot pickled ``kimichi'' and everything
else about South Korea _ the country he left shortly after his
birth.
	   ``I am happy that I came back here. I think it's a wonderful
place,'' he said Friday after running around a serene ancient royal
palace in the capital of Seoul.
	   Erik and his 7-year old sister, Nicole, were among 28 Korean
children adopted by families in California, who arrived here
Thursday for a five-day visit.
	   ``I think it's a wonderful opportunity. It's always good for
someone to feel good about his heritage,'' said their father, Don
Reinertsen.
	   The children were invited by first lady Lee Hee-ho who met them
during President Kim Dae-jung's state visit to the United States in
June.
	   Since the early 1950s, about 150,000 South Korean children have
been adopted by foreigners, mostly by Americans.
	   On Friday, the group had lunch with Lee and toured some tourist
attractions in Seoul, including Kyongbok Palace near the
presidential Blue House.
	   ``I extent my heartfelt thanks to you adoptive parents,'' Lee
told the luncheon meeting. ``I also pray that you adopted children
will keep growing wonderfully to be members of the mainstream
American society.''
	   The homecoming was special for Kim Sundell Brown, 43, who left
Seoul in 1956 when he was adopted as a 1-year-old. Forty-two years
later, he has returned _ with his own two adopted Korean children.
	   ``It is very important for my kids to be exposed to their
heritage at an early age,'' said Brown, who recalled how hard it
was growing up in Nebraska, where there were few Asians.
	   Brown, an Orange County financial consultant, said he always
resented how he knew so little about his family background. All he
knew was that his mother was Korean and that his father was
probably an American soldier.
	   And so he was determined to offer his children a better chance
to learn about Korea.
	   Some parents were carrying Korean language books. At the palace,
they shouted, ``hurry up,'' or ``come here'' in Korean to their
children.
	   JoLee Admich, a 27-year old lawyer from Los Angeles, who was
adopted at 4, said she gradually grew to recognize her roots and
now regards herself as a Korean-American.
	   ``I am very glad that the Korean government is recognizing that
adoptees are Koreans and is trying to build a relationship with
them,'' she said.
	   Michael Sloan, 14, a Los Angeles middle-school student, was
enthralled by people dressed in colorful traditional Korean
costume.
	   ``I don't remember any of this. It is new even though I was born
here,'' he said.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The African Development Bank has
approved a dlrs 30 million loan to help finance the construction of
a toll bridge in the Ivory Coast's commercial capital of Abidjan.
	   The private sector loan will represent 20 percent of the total
project cost repayable over 12 years, the bank said Thursday.
	   The bridge, the first of its kind in this West African nation,
will link the Riviera and Marcory suburbs, saving commuters between
the two areas valuable time by bypassing the busy downtown
commercial and administrative center area known as Plateau.
	   Other investors in the bridge project include the World Bank,
the International Finance Corporation and the West African
Development Bank.
	   __
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Good governance, the battle against
corruption and better management of national resources are the
topics to be tackled during a five-day seminar in the Ivory Coast
being hosted by the African Development Bank.
	   The conference on Public Procurement Reform in Africa will take
place in the Ivorian commercial capital Abidjan through next week.
	   ``By the end of the conference it is expected that the country
representatives will have developed or improved their outlook for a
public procurement reform program in their countries,'' the bank
said.
	   The World Bank and the United Nations Development Fund are
co-sponsors of the conference.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Austrian government has canceled
Uganda's bilateral debt of Uganda shillings 22 billion (dlrs 19
million), a newspaper cited an Austrian diplomat as saying Friday.
	   The government-owned New Vision daily said the Austrian
government on Thursday delivered a communique to the Ugandan
authorities officially waiving the debt.
	   The newspaper said the message was delivered to Minister of
Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya by Aston Mair, mission chief of the
Austrian Regional Bureau for Development Cooperation.
	   Mair said Austria was also aiding Uganda with dlrs 10 to 12
million annually in bilateral aid to finance Uganda's efforts to
promote good governance, human rights, private sector development,
water supply, professional training and culture promotion.
	   Austria has also contributed Ugandan shillings 7 billion (dlrs 5
million) to the multilateral debt fund in the Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels killed two inmates and abducted
another 65 in a raid on a government prison in eastern Uganda,
media reports said Friday.
	   The raid by more than 100 heavily armed assailants, believed to
be rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army, occurred Thursday at a
prison near the town of Soroti, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
north of Kampala, reports including The Monitor newspaper said.
	   The privately owned daily, citing deputy officer in charge of
prisons David Wanyama, said the gunmen stormed the prison from
several directions at dawn Thursday and ordered the inmates out at
gunpoint.
	   Two inmates were killed and another three were injured in an
exchange of gunfire that ensued between the rebels and prison
guards.
	   Wanyama said the prison guards were armed only with two guns,
and the rebels fled with 65 inmates.
	   Police spokesman Bob Ngobi could not confirm the reports.
	   The LRA has been fighting a 12-year insurgency in northern
Uganda, targeting mostly civilians aimed at destabilizing the
government of President Yoweri Museveni.
	   Meanwhile, more than 14 LRA rebels were killed Wednesday in
clashes with Ugandan soldiers in the northern Gulu district, about
270 kilometers (168 miles) north of Kampala, the New Vision said
Thursday.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - At least 150 Zimbabwean and South
African farmers are to start operating in three districts of the
central Mozambican province of Manica.
	   Provincial governor Felicio Zacarias told the Mozambique News
Agency, AIM, that the Zimbabweans visited Manica recently and
expressed interest in investing in the districts of Machaze,
Sussundenga and Barue.
	   ``Such investment is important for Manica because it will help
develop farming and will create jobs,'' Zacarias said.

Government seeks new powers to curb soccer hooligans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government on Friday proposed new powers to
combat violence associated with soccer, including authority to
seize passports of convicted criminals, curb overseas travel by
known hooligans even if they have not been convicted, and to outlaw
racist chants.
	   ``Trouble has declined in recent years but we must not become
complacent. There are still a small minority who ruin things for
the decent supporter. They cause mayhem, grab the headlines and
divert resources,'' said Home Office Minister Kate Hoey, who
introduced the proposals at a news conference at Arsenal Football
Club.
	   She said she hoped the proposals would enhance England's bid to
host of the World Cup finals in 2006.
	   Some of the 29 proposals were intended to plug holes in existing
legislation. For instance, the law against racist chants now
applies to incidents involving two or more people _ the government
proposes to make it applicable to individuals.
	   Other proposed amendments would make it illegal to drink alcohol
or be drunk on special trains and buses heading to matches, or to
be drunk at a match. Existing legislation barring ticket scalping
would be extended to cover matches overseas.
	   The government also proposed to create a new offense of
disorderly conduct, to bar behavior which is ``likely to distress,
harass or alarm'' even if it did not involve actual violence.
	   Sports Minister Tony Banks said the proposals would send ``a
clear statement'' to soccer's world governing body, FIFA, that
England could stage a successful World Cup.
	   ``Our vision is to put on a tournament that will be remembered
for the high quality facilities, great football and a friendly and
welcoming atmosphere. Today's announcement should help us to fulfil
that ambition,'' Banks said.
	   On Thursday, the National Criminal Intelligence Service reported
a ``marked increase'' in soccer violence in the first month of this
season.
	   ``Although it is too early to say whether the overall downward
trend for football related arrest figures over the past five years
is being reversed, the signs are not encouraging,'' said Bryan
Drew, head of the NCIS Strategic and Specialist Intelligence
Branch.

Russian space controllers fix hiccups on international station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian flight controllers have fixed two minor
glitches on the first orbiting module of the new international
space station, and it was operating smoothly on Friday, a news
report said.
	   The Zarya, or Sunrise, had developed three problems since its
launch a week ago: one battery was failing, one of the antennas
hadn't unfolded properly, and the humidity level in the unmanned
cabin was too high.
	   However, the antenna has apparently unfolded, and repeated tests
showed it was working perfectly, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Friday, citing Mission Control officials.
	   Even if trouble develops again, it shouldn't affect the
scheduled rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour,
which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting
module.
	   The shuttle crew is to capture Zarya using the Endeavour's robot
arm and then attach the two modules during space walks.
	   Zarya's antenna _ which serves the module's manual docking
system as a back-up for capturing cargo ships _ will only be needed
on the later stages of the project, officials have said.
	   The accumulator battery _ one of Zarya's eight _ was fixed
through commands sent by controllers on the ground, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Zarya has plenty of extra battery power, Russia's space chief
Yuri Koptev has said. Only four batteries of the eight batteries
are needed to provide normal levels of power.
	   The humidity level in Zarya's cabin still remained too high on
Friday. But space officials said they expected the problem to
resolve by itself after the module has had enough time to heat up.
	   The new station will not host a crew until at least early 2000.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-foot) Zarya, built by the Russian
Khrunichev company, will provide propulsion, power and
communications during the early stages of the space station
project.
	   The new station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.
	   The station will weigh around 500 tons and is expected to cost
at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay
more than half the cost. It will serve as an orbital home for
visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.

Russia to hold closed tender to choose food aid distributors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia announced plans Friday to hold a closed
tender to choose the Russian companies that will be responsible for
distributing Western food aid.
	   The selection will be watched carefully, since one of the major
concerns of Western donors is the potential for corruption in the
distribution process.
	   The Russian government has already tentatively agreed to food
aid deals with the United States and the European Union valued at
at roughly dlrs 1 billion.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Friday that the
government might sign a final agreement with the EU sooner than
with the United States, according to Interfax.
	   He said the EU has already submitted its terms to the Russian
Cabinet, while a final version of the U.S. aid deal isn't expected
to reach Moscow until Dec. 2.
	   Kulik said the Ministries of Agriculture, Economics and Trade
have drafted a list of which regions will receive food aid, and how
much. He said EU food is expected to primarily reach northern and
northwestern regions, and that from the United States to go to
Chukotka, Kamchatka and other parts of the Far East.
	   The Russian companies that are said to be among the candidates
to distribute the aid are Roskhleborprodukt, Myasmoltorg and
Prodintorg, Interfax said.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote by defense minister &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Responding to Israel's growing casualty toll in
southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a
European tour Friday to review his Lebanon policy and was quoted as
saying he no longer rules out a unilateral troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was in London when he received word late Thursday that
two Israeli soldiers were killed by bombs that went off under their
armored vehicles in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu canceled a trip to
Spain and flew home to Israel on Friday.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to seven the number of soldiers killed
in Lebanon over the past 10 days. In all, 23 Israelis have died in
Lebanon this year in clashes with the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group
Hezbollah.
	   Hezbollah, using tactics like ambushes and roadside bombs, wants
to drive Israel out of the zone it established in south Lebanon in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   Lebanon's government insists that Israel pull its soldiers out
of the country without negotiations.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held Lebanon
responsible, in part, for the violence. ``The new president of
Lebanon, Gen. Lahoud, and the new Lebanese parliament cannot
dissociate themselves and sit idly by in this situation,'' he said.

Researchers in Spain serve up Bronze Age beer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Archeologists who scraped residue from the
bottom of a broken clay jar have cooked up Bronze Age beer.
	   In a feat reminiscent of Jurassic Park dinosaur-breeding,
University of Barcelona researchers say they have recreated a batch
of Europe's oldest beer.
	   The result may not be for everyone _ thickish, on the dark side
and a bit flat. Plus it has particles floating in it, and packs a
16-proof punch.
	   The 3,100-year-old recipe was pieced together through
microscopic examination of scrapings from the bottom of a red clay
jar found at an archeological dig known as Geno, in Spain's
northeast Catalonia region.
	   Jose Luis Maya, a history professor, said Friday that he and
other researchers turned to brewers at a nearby San Miguel beer
plant for help in cooking up a fresh batch of old beer.
	   And they insisted on brewing it by hand, like in the Bronze Age.
``We did not use any of the technology at the factory,'' he said in
an interview from Barcelona.
	   Maya said tests done on the Geno residue showed the brewers used
barley and a kind of wheat called emmer. ``They also added herbs as
preservatives,'' Maya said. ``That's the problem with beer. If you
don't add preservatives, it goes bad quickly.''
	   In its day, the Geno site was a settlement of about 100 people
who abandoned it after a fire. For centuries it lay undiscovered,
until soldiers digging a machine-gun nest in the Spanish Civil War
of 1936-1939 stumbled across it.
	   The site has been under continuous study since 1976.
	   Maya said the Geno beer residue is the oldest ever discovered in
Europe. But he noted that remains of sorghum beer made 9,000 years
ago have been found in Sudan and that beer was widely popular among
the ancient Egyptians.
	   Maya said his team's beer filled 400 bottles which were unveiled
Thursday at a tasting for university officials and the media.
	   The reviews were generally positive. Some of the guinea pigs
even said the beer should be produced commercially, but Maya ruled
this out. ``We just made it for fun,'' he said.

Turkey appeals to NATO for Kurdish leader's extradition from Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Italy-Kurds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin has
complained to NATO about Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader because he faces the death penalty in Turkey, it was
announced Friday.
	   Italy's refusal to extradite Abdullah Ocalan has led to a
diplomatic crisis between Rome and Ankara.
	   ``It is not possible to explain the guest status of that
terrorist in an allied country,'' Sezgin said in a letter to NATO
chief Javier Solana and his NATO counterparts Thursday. ``I fully
believe you will provide the necessary support for the extradition
of this criminal for trial.''
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been waging a
guerrilla war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The
conflict has claimed 37,000 lives.
	   In an attempt to defuse Italian objections, Turkey has drafted a
bill to lift the death penalty in Turkey, although no execution has
been carried out in over a decade.
	   The justice ministry handed over Ocalan's criminal file to the
foreign ministry on Friday for relay to Italian authorities.
	   The file includes details of the draft bill to abolish capital
punishment, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12, upon arrival from
Moscow, which refused his request for political asylum. Italy is
also examining his asylum request.
	   Ocalan left his longtime home in Syria in October, after Turkey
threatened military action against Damascus unless it ceased
support for the rebels.
	   Turkey maintains a 750,000-member army, the largest in terms of
numbers after U.S. forces in NATO.

Coalition force commander warns rebel chiefs to take amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A senior military commander with a
West African coalition army in Sierra Leone is urging the leaders
of the country's rebel movement to take an amnesty and quit their
countryside war.
	   ``If the five prominent rebel leaders fail to surrender and take
advantage of the amnesty, then they will have to face the bullet,''
said Nigerian Gen. Abu Ahmadu.
	   The five rebels include Johnny Paul Koroma, the former Sierra
Leonean army officer who seized power in a May 1997 coup. He was
later ousted by the Nigerian-led coalition force known as ECOMOG.
	   Koroma's whereabouts are unknown, but varying reports say he
either has already fled the country or is hiding in the thick
forested area in the country's southeast near the border with
Liberia.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah recently offered an amnesty to
Koroma and four other rebel leaders and the guarantee of safe
passage out of Sierra Leone in return for their surrender.
	   There has been no definitive response to the offer.
	   Remnants of Koroma's Armed Forces Ruling Council linked up with
their longtime allies, the rebel Revolutionary United Front, after
the military junta was toppled in February.
	   Kabbah, with the backing of ECOMOG troops, controls the capital
of Freetown, but the rebels and the ousted military rulers still
wreck havoc in rural Sierra Leone.
	   Kabbah's deputy defense minister, Samuel Hinga Norman said the
government was aiming to end the country's ongoing conflict before
the end of the year.
	   ``For those who are apprehensive about the war coming to an end,
ECOMOG will make it possible to see that war ends come the end of
December,'' Norman said.
	   The rebel and military junta alliance have been waging a
guerrilla war in the countryside, often torturing and murdering
civilians as a form of terror to intimidate the population.
	   Aid workers, the United Nations and human rights groups say
thousands of people have been either maimed, raped or killed by the
rebels.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Responding to Israel's growing casualty toll in
southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a
European tour Friday to review his Lebanon policy and was quoted as
saying that he no longer rules out a unilateral troop withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu was in London when he received word late Thursday that
two Israeli soldiers had been killed by bombs that went off under
their armored vehicles in southern Lebanon. Netanyahu canceled a
trip to Spain and flew home on Friday.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to seven the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in Lebanon over the past 10 days. In all, 23
Israelis have died in Lebanon this year in clashes with the Shiite
Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   Hezbollah, using tactics like ambushes and roadside bombs, wants
to drive Israel out of the zone it established in south Lebanon in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   Lebanon's government insists that Israel pull its soldiers out
of the country without negotiations.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held Lebanon
responsible, in part, for the violence. ``The new president of
Lebanon, Gen. Lahoud, and the new Lebanese parliament cannot
dissociate themselves and sit idly by in this situation,'' he said.

New Iraqi ambassador to Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has approved the nomination of
Iraq's new ambassador, an Iraqi embassy spokesman said Friday.
	   Ambassador-designate Sabah Yassin will arrive in Jordan this
week and present his credentials to Crown Prince Hassan in few
days, said the spokesman, Sadoun Daoud.
	   Yassin will replace Nouri Alweiss who was transferred to Baghdad
as part of a diplomatic corp shakeup ordered by Saddam Hussein,
involving 18 ambassadors in Iraqi missions abroad.
	   Before being named ambassador, Yassin was the head of Iraq's
state-run radio and television.
	   Previously, he was the chief editor of the ruling Baath party's
newspaper, Al-Thwara. Yassin's age was not immediately known but he
is believed to be in his early 50s.

Marsh stays on top, Aoki seeks win for 5th straight year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SADOHARA, Japan (AP) _ Isao Aoki, seeking Japan Senior Open
title for an unprecedented fifth straight year, shot a 2-over-par
74 Friday and stood four shots behind his overnight co-leader
Graham Marsh of Australia.
	   The 54-year-old Marsh, winner of 25 Japan PGA events but a
non-winner on the Japan Senior Tour, fired a 70 for a 9-under 135
total, four strokes ahead of Aoki's 139.
	   Aoki, who last won the BellSouth Senior Classic in June in
Nashville, Tennessee, had a round of one birdie, one bogey and one
double bogey at the 6,754-yard (6,146-meter), par-72 Ube Country
Club course.
	   Aoki, 56, is Japan's second most winningest golfer with 73
career victories, following Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki's 109 wins.
	   No one has ever won the same professional golf tournament five
consecutive times. And if Aoki wins Sunday, it will be an
international record.
	   In the Japan Senior Open last year, Aoki became the only golfer
in Japan to win the same event for the fourth straight year.
	   In the United States, only Walter Hagen and Laura Davies have
won the same tournament four years in a row.
	   Davies did it in the 1997 Standard Register Ping. Hagen won the
PGA Championship four straight years beginning in 1924.
	   ``We still have two more rounds to go,'' said Aoki. ``I'll come
back tomorrow and make a run at Marsh.''

Convicted killer executed, thieves' hands amputated in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Thousands of people watched Friday in
Kabul as a convicted killer was executed and two men, both
convicted of theft, had their right hands amputated.
	   Scores of women wearing all-enveloping burqas wailed and pleaded
for mercy.
	   But on the sprawling grounds of the Kabul Stadium, the father of
the murder victim carried out the death sentence.
	   The father, whose name was not given, slit the throat of his
son's killer while an estimated 8,000 people watched from the
stands, officials and eyewitnesses said.
	   Mohammed Samandar was found guilty of killing a taxi driver in
eastern Tagab, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) northeast of the
capital, and sentenced to die by the Taliban, the religious militia
that rules 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   In keeping with the Taliban's brand of Islamic law, the relative
of the murder victim is allowed to carry out the death sentence.
However, prior to the execution, Taliban officials asked the
victim's father to show mercy and spare the killer.
	   He refused.
	   ''Brothers, this man killed my son. Now his children have no
father. I have to kill this man,'' the father told spectators at
the stadium.
	   After the execution, two doctors, their faces covered by
surgical masks, amputated the right hands of two convicted thieves,
Shah Aga and Khiel Mohammed.
	   The men were found guilty of stealing the equivalent of dlrs
1,400.
	   The amputations were conducted on the cold ground of the
stadium. Both men were unconscious while the doctors did their
work.
	   A Taliban official displayed the hands, warning that this was
the penalty for theft.
	   The two men were later taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital,
witnesses said.

China's defense minister soothes regional fears over military might
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SIN102
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ China's defense minister sought on Friday to
soothe fears in the Asia-Pacific region over his country's military
might by describing its substantial armed forces as a relatively
small, non-threatening power undergoing important reforms.
	   ``China will never seek to be a superpower,'' said Minister of
National Defense Chi Haotian in a speech in Singapore on China's
military policy. ``China will never pose a threat to other
countries.''
	   Speaking in Mandarin, Chi said Asia's largest nation will
continue to focus on boosting its economy, and military expenditure
will be subordinated to national development.
	   ``Compared to the United States and Japan, China's defense
budget is very small indeed,'' he said.
	   In 1998, the country spent about dlrs 11 billion on defense,
compared to about dlrs 42 billion by Japan and dlrs 255 billion by
the United States, according to Chi.
	   And unlike other military world powers, China lacks the ability
to mount a long-range attack, he argued.
	   Despite this, the country maintains a huge army, with about 1.2
million people in uniform.
	   Recently-implemented reforms that remove the People's Liberation
Army's extensive commercial enterprises were extremely important,
Chi said.
	   ``These commercial activities brought some very negative
influences and effects into the PLA,'' he said.
	   The army ventured into commerce in the 1980s to supplement
declining government outlays as China concentrated on modernizing
its backward economy.
	   By the early 1990s, revenues from such enterprises _ in
everything from hotels to discos and mobile phone networks _
supplied a third of the PLA's operating expenses, and had raised
the specter of growing corruption in the military.
	   To sustain regional stability, Chi reiterated China's long-held
belief that countries should refrain from interfering in the
internal affairs of other nations.
	   Chi is on a four-day trip to the Southeast Asian city-state, and
has met his Singapore counterpart Tony Tan in addition to Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

England's Anthony Wall takes over second round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ England's Anthony Wall fired a 6-under-par 65
Friday to take a one-stroke lead over Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng
after the second round of the U.S. dlrs 300,000 Perrier Hong Kong
Open Golf Championship.
	   Wall, a 23-year-old European Tour rookie, shot seven birdies and
one bogey on the 6,727-yard, par-71 Composite Course of the Hong
Kong Golf Club for a total of 133.
	   ``The course was in good shape, and I was hitting the fairways
and greens with accuracy,'' said the player from Sunningdale.
	   Hsieh, the overnight leader, shot a 1-under-par 70 to add to his
64 on Thursday.
	   American Mark Brooks, the 1996 PGA Championship winner, fired a
3-under par 68 for the second straight round to finish on joint
third place with Taiwan's Wang Ter-chang. Wang had a 70 after
carding a 66 on Thursday.
	   American John Daly, the 1991 PGA Championship winner, had a
1-over-par 72 to finish on 13th place with six other players on
138. The American, who was joint second overnight, shot a 66 on
Thursday.
	   Defending champion Frank Nobilo of New Zealand could only manage
a 73 on Friday and was tied for 52nd with eight other players on
143.

Drug lords arrested, 40 kilograms of heroin seized in Prague, Czech
</HEADLINE>
Republic (AP) _ Three drug lords were arrested and 40 kilograms of
high-quality heroin was seized in Prague last week, police
announced Friday.

<TEXT>
	   The drug, worth dlrs 9 million, was hidden in boxes among tons
bananas imported from Costa Rica. It was seized by anti-drug police
as it was being unloaded in a remote warehouse in the outskirts of
the city Nov. 19.
	   Two gang bosses were arrested as they oversaw the unloading. The
third was arrested the same day in a different part of Prague.
	   The three men, all Czech citizens, were charged with illegal
possession of drugs and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
	   The number of drug hauls grew from 53 in 1995 to 68 in 1997. So
far this year, more than 250 kilograms of heroin have been seized.
	   Almost non-existent under the Communist regime, the number of
drug addicts is at about 80,000 in this country of 10 million, up
from 30,000 in 1993.

	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac officially opened the 20th
French-African summit on Friday with a call for African nations to
do their own peacekeeping -- an abrupt departure from past
practices that put the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Security is the theme of the summit which has drawn 49 African
nations, and 34 heads of state, to Paris until Saturday. But
center-stage went to Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila.
	   French prosecutors on Friday rejected efforts by human rights
groups to charge Kabila with massive abuse of human rights.
	   The prosecutor's office ruled that Kabila benefits from the
customary immunity accorded to exercising heads of state.
	   The French Human Rights League and the International Federation
of Human Rights Leagues -- spurred by the decision of the House of
Lords rejecting immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet -- filed complaints this week against Kabila.
	   That strides could be made behind the scenes here in resolving
the Congo crisis was an unspoken hope.
	   Kabila crosses paths here Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader. Both Rwanda and Uganda support
rebels waging an insurgency in the Congo.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ All Olympic sports _ except for
soccer, tennis and cycling _ agreed Friday to a package of measures
aimed at unifying the fight against banned drugs.
	   International sports federations endorsed a single Olympic
medical code that calls for a minimum two-year suspension for
athletes found guilty of taking steroids and other serious
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The sanction for a second offense would be a life ban.
	   In a significant move, the resolution adopted Friday said any
federations which don't comply with the agreement could be dropped
from the Olympics.
	   FIFA, the governing body of soccer, expressed reservations about
the two-year penalty on grounds that certain banned drugs have no
performance-boosting benefits for soccer players.
	   FIFA's acting secretary general, Michael Zen-Ruffinen, said he
would refer the issue for consideration by the federation's
governing board.
	   FIFA, the International Tennis Federation and the International
Cycling Union all objected to the resolution which threatens sports
with expulsion from the Olympics if they don't comply.

Kremlin: Yeltsin's health record makes it harder for him to
</HEADLINE>
recuperate &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin's spokesman saying his past
heart condition affects his ability to overcome illnesses. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's past heart attacks
combined with the pressures of his job make it more difficult for
him to battle common illnesses these days, his spokesman
acknowledged Friday.
	   ``In 1996, the president was working through several heart
attacks while carrying out a very active election campaign,''
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said at a news conference.
	   The past ailments, combined with the ``emotional, physical and
psychological pressure endured by the president are taking its
toll'' on the president and make it harder for him to overcome
routine illnesses, such as the flu, Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized since the weekend, undergoing
treatment for pneumonia, the latest in a series of ailments that
have raised concerns about his ability to serve out his term until
the year 2000.
	   In the past, the Kremlin insisted that the president had fully
recovered from his heart problems that led to a quintuple bypass
surgery in November 1996.
	   Doctors and Yeltsin aides previously made a point of saying that
the frequent illnesses suffered by the 67-year old leader in the
past two years were unrelated to his heart condition.
	   Doctors have acknowledged that Yeltsin had heart attacks before,
but his aides had never previously confirmed it. The Russian media
has reported that Yeltsin has suffered as many as five heart
attacks.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin's temperature was normal and his
condition ``satisfactory'' on Friday. But he said doctors had told
the president to stay in bed.
	   ``He's partly bed-ridden, that means he spends some time in bed,
but also moves around his room and works at the table,'' Yakushkin
said, adding that the ``president's activity has increased.''
	   ``He had several telephone conversations and considered several
important documents,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Doctors banned Yeltsin from seeing visitors, fearing they may
infect him with a virus going around the Russian capital, Yakushkin
said.
	   The spokesman did not comment on when Yeltsin was expected to
leave the hospital, saying only that a treatment for pneumonia
usually takes at least eight to 10 days.
	   Both Yakushkin and Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg
Sysuyev continued to insist that the president was capable of
performing his duties until the end of his term.
	   ``We trust the doctors whose job it is to take care of the
president,'' Sysuyev said at a news conference Friday. ``Doctors
believe he can fulfill his duties until 2000.''
	   Sysuyev dismissed suggestions that early presidential elections
should be held next fall at the same time as parliamentary
elections, saying that would destabilize the nation. ``That would
be a crime,'' Sysuyev was quoted as saying.
	   Yeltsin has rarely appeared in public in recent months, and has
said little about the country's economic crisis, the worst in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Yeltsin continues to support Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov but
recently urged his Cabinet to work faster to deal with the crisis,
Yakushkin said in an interview with Izvestia.
	   Yeltsin has urged the government to adhere to free-market
principles and not allow too much state intervention into the
economy, Yakushkin said.
	   ``The president isn't against an increased role for the state,
but he wouldn't approve of extensive intervention for the sake of
intervention,'' the spokesman said.

Iran says Americans attacked last week were businessmen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Friday disclosed that a group of
Americans who were attacked by Islamic militants last week were
members of a business delegation exploring investment
opportunities.
	   The acknowledgement by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi constituted the first official description of the 13
Americans, who left the country a day after the attack Saturday.
	   They were traveling in a bus in Tehran when radicals chanting
``Death to America'' and wielding iron bars hurled stones at the
vehicle, smashing windows and injuring some of the occupants.
	   Until now, Iranian officials had maintained that the Americans
were tourists.
	   The attack is believed to have been triggered by reports in
hardline newspapers accusing the visitors of being members of the
Central Intelligence Agency posing as tourists.
	   Asefi said the Americans were allowed into Iran to increase
pressure against U.S. sanctions that ban American companies from
investing in Iran.
	   ``Iran will use all possible means to increase public awareness,
as it welcomes the activities of foreign companies, including
American companies, against the U.S. sanctions,'' the official
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Asefi as saying.
	   But he said that allowing the Americans did not soften Iranian
resolve against resuming diplomatic relations with the United
States.
	   Asefi said the Foreign Ministry had initially denied the
presence of the U.S. delegation because the visit had not been
coordinated with it. He did not identify the businessmen further.
	   On Thursday, President Mohammad Khatami condemned the attack as
``an affront to the honor of the Iranian people.''
	   U.S. officials in Washington denied that any of the Americans
were government officials or had links to the CIA.
	   The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group that was dormant for
many years, has claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' the group said in a statement Monday.
The warning appeared to refer to Khatami's call for cultural
exchanges between the United States and Iran.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly
after the 1979 revolution.

Damages from Soviet occupation tallied at billions of dollars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Damages to Estonia's farmland, forests
and waterways caused by Soviet troops during their 50-year
occupation will cost at least 5 billion dollars to clean up, the
environment ministry said Friday.
	   The estimate, based on a recent study funded partly by Finland,
is four times Estonia's entire national budget.
	   ``This is not just a theoretical figure,'' ministry press
spokesman Kaidi Tingas said in an interview. ``Estonia expects to
have to actually have to pay this to clean up the damage over
time.''
	   Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II,
after which it became a major outpost for the Red Army. The Baltic
Sea nation regained independence in 1991. Moscow withdrew its
troops three years later.
	   At their peak, Soviet forces occupied more than 1,500 military
sites, covering more than 870 square kilometers, or 2 percent of
Estonia's total territory, according to Ms. Tingas.
	   That includes installations on islands, a submarine base near
the town of Paldiski, about 50 kms (30 miles) southwest of the
capital Tallinn, and underground bunkers.
	   The Paldiski area is littered with thousands of tons of oil,
spent missile shells, eroding batteries and even nuclear waste
residue from a once-active nuclear reactor.
	   Ms. Tingas said it's almost impossible that Estonia alone can
repair the damages any time soon. A special fund for cleaning old
military sites amounted to just 300,000 dollars.
	   International aid is being sought.
	   Government press spokesman Daniel Vaarik said Friday that the
Cabinet probably won't ask cash-strapped Moscow for funds.
	   ``It is not realistic to think we would get any money back from
Russia even if we tried,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ For the first time since hanging a Filipino
maid in 1995, Singapore is set to try another Filipino on charges
that carry the death penalty upon conviction.
	   A Singapore man and his Philippine girlfriend were arrested on
charges of selling methamphetamine, also known as ``ice,''
Singapore TV reported late Friday.
	   If convicted, they will be the first people to face execution
since the city-state, known for its tough drug laws, introduced the
death penalty for ice-trafficking convictions last April.
	   The last execution of a Philippine citizen in Singapore resulted
in a temporary severance of diplomatic ties between the two
countries.
	   In that case, Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino maid, was found
guilty of killing another Filipino maid and a young Singaporean boy
she cared for.
	   Singapore insists Contemplacion confessed, but many Filipinos
believed she was a victim of injustice.
	   Mass protests forced the Philippine government to withdraw its
ambassador, and Singapore responded by doing the same. Relations
were normalized in 1996 with the exchange of new ambassadors.

Mauro Gianetti sues two doctors over doping claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss cyclist Mauro Gianetti is
suing two doctors for 4 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.9 million)
over claims that he collapsed after taking a performance-enhancing
drug.
	   Swiss newspapers reported Friday that Gianetti's lawyer had sent
the payment demands to Gerald Gremion for 3 million francs (dlrs
2.1 million) and Jean-Pierre Randin for 900,000 francs (dlrs
642,000). Both say they will fight the case.
	   Gianetti, 34, was rushed to hospital during a Swiss road-cycling
race last May. He claims it was due to a bad allergy and has denied
any involvement with doping.
	   But Gremion, who was doctor to Swiss teams PMU Romand and Swiss
Port, maintained that Gianetti nearly died after he took PFC, a
hemoglobin which speeds up oxygen intake.
	   At the height of the Tour de France drug scandal, the two
doctors filed a legal complaint against ``persons unknown'' for
endangering the life of Gianetti with the drug. They said they did
this to publicize the dangers of PFC.
	   An investigation into this is ongoing.
	   In a bid to prevent publicity, Gianetti's lawyer earlier this
week took out a court order against a Swiss television program to
prevent the cyclist being named or pictured on the program.
	   ``What has Gianetti to hide?'' the newspaper Blick asked Friday.

 &UR; Government seeks new powers to curb soccer hooligans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government on Friday proposed new powers to
combat violence associated with soccer, including authority to
seize passports of convicted criminals, curb overseas travel by
known hooligans even if they have not been convicted, and to outlaw
racist chants.
	   ``Trouble has declined in recent years but we must not become
complacent. There are still a small minority who ruin things for
the decent supporter. They cause mayhem, grab the headlines and
divert resources,'' said Home Office Minister Kate Hoey, who
introduced the proposals at a news conference at Arsenal Football
Club.
	   She said she hoped the proposals would enhance England's bid to
host of the World Cup finals in 2006.
	   Some of the 29 proposals were intended to plug holes in existing
legislation. For instance, the law against racist chants now
applies to incidents involving two or more people _ the government
proposes to make it applicable to individuals.
	   Other proposed amendments would make it illegal to drink alcohol
or be drunk on special trains and buses heading to matches, or to
be drunk at a match. Existing legislation barring ticket scalping
would be extended to cover matches overseas.
	   The government also proposed to create a new offense of
disorderly conduct, to bar behavior which is ``likely to distress,
harass or alarm'' even if it did not involve actual violence.
	   Sports Minister Tony Banks said the proposals would send ``a
clear statement'' to soccer's world governing body, FIFA, that
England could stage a successful World Cup.
	   ``Our vision is to put on a tournament that will be remembered
for the high quality facilities, great football and a friendly and
welcoming atmosphere. Today's announcement should help us to fulfil
that ambition,'' Banks said.
	   On Thursday, the National Criminal Intelligence Service reported
a ``marked increase'' in soccer violence in the first month of this
season.
	   ``Although it is too early to say whether the overall downward
trend for football related arrest figures over the past five years
is being reversed, the signs are not encouraging,'' said Bryan
Drew, head of the NCIS Strategic and Specialist Intelligence
Branch.

Good batting needed by South Africa against WIndies cricketers

 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC;

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa, having quickly
dismissed the West Indies for 261 in the first half-hour of play,
were 53 for one wicket at lunch on the second day of the first test
against the Caribbean team at the Wanderers Stadium Friday.
	   Pick of the bowlers for South Africa was Shaun Pollock, who took
five wickets for 54, his best international return at the
Wanderers. His morning spell on the first day destroyed the West
Indies top order, and he wrapped up the tail with a fiery spell.
	   He and Allan Donald took the remaining three West Indies wickets
for 12 runs, as they tried to build on their overnight score of 249
for seven.
	   Then the great Courtney Walsh moved to the top of the West
Indies wicket-taking tree with Malcolm Marshall, claiming Adam
Bacher (caught behind for one) for his 376th test wicket, as South
Africa's dreadful run of poor opening partnerships continued.
	   The last reasonable start to an innings for South Africa came in
March this year, against Sri Lanka, when Kirsten and Gerhardus
Liebenberg put on 89.
	   With conventional wisdom that the Wanderers pitch is best for
batting through the second day and well into the third, South
Africa will be looking to their deep batting line-up.
	   Pat Symcox coming in at nine has a test century to his credit to
make a big score to put the West Indies second innings under
pressure from the start. One of the things South Africa has to do,
however, is survive the legspin of Rawl Lewis, who is already
turning the ball appreciably.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Supporters of Malaysian dissident
Anwar Ibrahim held protests at two universities on Friday, the
national Bernama news agency said.
	   Anwar, once the nation's No. 2 leader, was fired as deputy prime
minister and finance minister in September.
	   He was later arrested and is now on trial on corruption and
sexual misconduct charges. He says he is innocent.
	   Some 600 people took part in Friday's protest outside the
University Malaya Mosque, who marked then dispersed after 10
minutes, the report said.
	   Thirty people attended a separate gathering outside the
University Putra Malaysia Mosque in Serdang, outside Kuala Lumpur,
it said.
	   All pro-Anwar gatherings are illegal in Malaysia. Police were
quoted as saying that four students were detained on suspicion of
possessing anti-government posters and banners.

U.S. Embassy expands visa services to all applicants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The United States said Friday it will
restore next week all visa services in Kenya for the first time
since a terrorist bomb destroyed its embassy in Nairobi.
	   The consular section reopened at a new location on Nov. 12 but
has only provided visas to students, whose cases were seen as the
most urgent.
	   The embassy said as of Monday it will expand its visa services
to applicants for all classifications of nonimmigrant visas,
including business and tourist visas.
	   The applicants will only be served after making an appointment
by telephone. For security reasons, they will not be allowed to
bring friends or relatives, baggage or packages to the new consular
offices in a Nairobi suburb.
	   Parking is not permitted at the site.
	   Before the bombing, visa applicants arrived at the downtown U.S.
Embassy without appointments, and formed long lines outside and
inside the embassy, waiting to be served.
	   The bombing Aug. 2 killed 213 people in Nairobi, among them 12
Americans including Consul General Julian Bartley and his son, Jay.
Several Kenyan consular employees also died.
	   Another 11 people were killed in a nearly simultaneous bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
	   U.S. authorities believe Osama bin Laden, Saudi exile and
militant Muslim, masterminded the bombings. Three alleged
co-conspirators are already jailed in New York.

LAUSANNE: don't comply.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Soccer, cycling and tennis were the same three sports which
failed to comply fully with previous IOC accords on harmonization
of doping rules and sanctions.
	   But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was confident
the three federations would sign up to the agreement before the
world anti-doping conference in Lausanne on Feb. 2-4.
	   ``These three federations have reservations, but after
consulting with their governing bodies, I'm sure they will agree,''
Samaranch said. ``I think all federations will remain on the
Olympic program. The policy of the IOC is not to threaten the
federations.''
	   Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, proposed the last-minute addition of a clause requiring
all federations to comply with the terms of the accord or else risk
their Olympic status.
	   The provision reads: ``The sports included on the program of the
Olympic Games must be governed by international federations which
agree to comply'' with the agreement.
	   On othher key points, the federations:
	   _ endorsed the creation of an independent anti-doping agency to
coordinate the fight against drugs around the world
	   _ called for cooperation on doping issues between sports bodies
and government authorities
	   _ pledged to intensify doping prevention policies through
educational and promotional campaigns
	   _ agreed to refer doping disputes to the Lausanne-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport once internal appeals procedures had been
exhausted

 &UR; East Timor rebel s kill two Indonesian security officers
 &UR; Eds: LEADS thruout with two security personnel killed by rebels. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Separatist rebels ambushed and killed two
Indonesian security officers as they rode motorcycles along a
remote stretch of road in the trouble territory of East Timor on
Friday, the military said.
	   East Timor's military chief Col. Tono Suratman said one police
officer and one soldier were shot to death near Bilimau, about 70
kilometers (43 miles) southwest of Dili, the provincial capital.
	   The deaths follow a upsurge in violence between Indonesian
forces and rebels in recent weeks.
	   Meanwhile, Australia urged Indonesia's military Friday to reduce
troop numbers in East Timor as part of international efforts to
reach a lasting peace.
	   Visiting Australian Defense Minister John Moore raised concerns
about army activity in the former Portuguese colony during talks
with Indonesia's military chief and Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto,
in Surabaya, Indonesia's second city.
	   ``We think that fewer troops in East Timor would be helpful,''
Moore said at a news conference after the 90-minute talks.
	   On Thursday, Australia said Indonesia had granted it permission
to send a military observer to East Timor to monitor the security
situation.
	   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, John McCarthy, said a
military attache from his embassy in Jakarta would travel to East
Timor on Tuesday.
	   Indonesia and Portugal are engaged in a new round of
U.N.-sponsored talks over the fate of East Timor, which Indonesia
invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   East Timor has endured a bloody guerrilla war and human rights
abuses since then.
	   In a bid to end the ongoing conflict with separatist rebels,
Indonesia has offered to grant autonomy to the half-island
territory in return for international recognition of its
sovereignty there.
	   Earlier this year Indonesia announced that it had withdrawn some
combat troops from East Timor as a goodwill gesture.
	   However, critics have claimed that it has actually increased
numbers.
	   Moore also said he had asked for permission for an Australian
investigator to visit East Timor as part of a new inquiry into the
deaths of six foreign journalists killed when Indonesian troops
invaded East Timor in 1975.
	   Indonesia maintains the men, Australian, New Zealand and British
citizens, were killed in crossfire during hostilities. East
Timorese activists say the men were executed.
	   Moore said Wiranto made no immediate response to the request.
	   The journalists' deaths have been a long-running issue between
the two neighboring countries.

Italy's justice minister suggests international tribunal to try
</HEADLINE>
Kurdish leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's justice minister on Friday suggested
resolving a diplomatic dispute over the fate of Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan by setting up an international tribunal in
Italy to try Ocalan.
	   Both Germany and Turkey have issued arrest warrants for Ocalan,
who is charged with terrorism. But Germany doesn't want him and
Italy's laws prohibit it from extraditing someone to a country
where they face the death penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in
Turkey.
	   This means Italy is stuck with the rebel leader and must decide
whether to accept his request for political asylum.
	   On Thursday, Italy's foreign minister contended Italy couldn't
grant Ocalan asylum because he cannot be considered a victim of
persecution.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema is still hopeful that Germany will ask
for his extradition and says Italy won't make a decision on the
asylum request until Dec. 22, when Germany's warrant expires.
	   Germany has repeatedly said it won't seek extradition because
the move is likely to spark violence between its 2 million Turks
and 400,000 Kurds.
	   Ocalan was arrested upon his arrival in Rome two weeks ago on a
flight from Moscow. He was detained in a military hospital for a
week and then transferred to a Rome villa where he is under police
surveillance while he awaits a decision from the Interior Ministry
on his asylum request.
	   Turkey is furious over Italy's refusal to extradite Ocalan, its
No. 1 fugitive, and has launched demonstrations and boycotts of
Italian goods.
	   On Thursday Turkey's caretaker government tuned down its tone
and invited Italy's premier to attend a Champions League soccer
game in Istanbul Wednesday.
	   Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto, member of a Communist party
that wants to grant Ocalan asylum, was quoted in the Repubblica
daily as saying an international tribunal ``would be an opportunity
for Ocalan to explain his position to the entire international
community.''
	   Diliberto said the European Union would oversee the tribunal to
``guarantee impartiality.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

Montenegro premier visits Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ The premier of Montenegro, the
smaller republic of present-day Yugoslavia, arrived Friday in
Slovenia on the first official visit by a government leader of the
federation Slovenia seceded from in 1991.
	   Filip Vujanovic was invited to visit by his Slovene counterpart
Boris Frlec. He also met President Milan Kucan and Premier Janez
Drnovsek.
	   Both Vujanovic and Frlec said they regretted the failure of
Slovenia and Yugoslavia to establish diplomatic relations seven
years after Slovenia proclaimed independence from the old
federation.
	   Relations have remained strained because of Yugoslavia's
insistence that it is the only heir to the former federation. That
has prevented the two countries from being able to agree on how to
divide the assets former Yugoslavia held abroad.
	   The absence of diplomatic relations hurts both countries'
citizens, the two said in a joint statement carried by the news
agency STA.
	   Slovenia and neighboring Croatia simultaneously proclaimed
independence from Yugoslavia, which led to a 10-day war in
Slovenia, and a much longer and bloodier war in Croatia, as
Yugoslav authorities sought to prevent the republics' secession.
	   Pressed by the West, Yugoslavia and Croatia established
diplomatic relations in August 1996.
	   Vujanovic said Montenegro, whose reformist leaders have been at
odds with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, ``has an open
foreign policy. It wants to be integrated into the European and
world's organizations.''
	   In an interview with the Slovene daily Delo, Vujanovic blamed
the Belgrade government for carrying out ``autarkic policy which
led Yugoslavia to isolation, economic stagnation and a decrease of
people's living standards.''
	   Vujanovic did not speak about Kosovo, Yugoslavia's southern
province, where international officials have been trying to
reconcile ethnic Albanians and Serbs.

	   The IOC called the meeting of 28 summer and seven winter
federations to garner endorsement of common rules, procedures and
sanctions. The IOC was intent on getting the federations to fall
into line before the February doping summit.
	   Previous IOC guidelines recommended a two-year ban as a maximum
punishment. In some cases, different federations have applied
different sanctions for the same offense.
	   The international cycling union, whose sport was damaged by
revelations of systematic doping during the Tour de France, voiced
no objections to the two-year penalty during Friday's debate.
	   But UCI president Hein Verbruggen said the penalty won't serve
much use because it won't be accepted by the legal system.
	   ``The rules have to be in line with what is acceptable to the
courts,'' he said. ``If we go to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport, they will never give two years. It's the priority of law.
You have to look at the consequences.''
	   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, said
sports should be kicked out of the Olympics if they can't accept
the common rules.
	   ``I think athletes in each sport should get the same sanction
for the same offense,'' he said. ``There should not be any
flexibiliy in the two years, except for the possibility of
additional penalties. If sports can't accept this, they don't
deserve to be in the Olympic movement.''
	   On another key issue, the federations expressed support for
establishment of a world anti-doping agency to spearhead
out-of-competition controls and coordinate drug-testing research.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who heads the project, said the
agency could be up and running early next year with initial funding
of dlrs 25 million from Olympic television revenues.

Federations agree to two-year ban, but FIFA objects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ All Olympic sports _ except for
soccer, tennis and cycling _ agreed Friday to a package of measures
aimed at unifying the fight against banned drugs.
	   International sports federations endorsed a single Olympic
medical code that calls for a minimum two-year suspension for
athletes found guilty of taking steroids and other serious
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The sanction for a second offense would be a life ban.
	   In a significant move, the resolution adopted Friday said any
federations which don't comply with the agreement could be dropped
from the Olympics.
	   FIFA, the governing body of soccer, expressed reservations about
the two-year penalty on grounds that certain banned drugs have no
performance-boosting benefits for soccer players.
	   FIFA's acting secretary general, Michael Zen-Ruffinen, said he
would refer the issue for consideration by the federation's
governing board.
	   FIFA, the International Tennis Federation and the International
Cycling Union all objected to the resolution which threatens sports
with expulsion from the Olympics if they don't comply.
	   Soccer, cycling and tennis were the same three sports which
failed to comply fully with previous IOC accords on harmonization
of doping rules and sanctions.
	   But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was confident
the three federations would sign up to the agreement before the
world anti-doping conference in Lausanne on Feb. 2-4.
	   ``These three federations have reservations, but after
consulting with their governing bodies, I'm sure they will agree,''
Samaranch said. ``I think all federations will remain on the
Olympic program. The policy of the IOC is not to threaten the
federations.''
	   Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, proposed the last-minute addition of a clause requiring
all federations to comply with the terms of the accord or else risk
their Olympic status.
	   The provision reads: ``The sports included on the program of the
Olympic Games must be governed by international federations which
agree to comply'' with the agreement.
	   On othher key points, the federations:
	   _ endorsed the creation of an independent anti-doping agency to
coordinate the fight against drugs around the world
	   _ called for cooperation on doping issues between sports bodies
and government authorities
	   _ pledged to intensify doping prevention policies through
educational and promotional campaigns
	   _ agreed to refer doping disputes to the Lausanne-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport once internal appeals procedures had been
exhausted
	   The IOC called the meeting of 28 summer and seven winter
federations to garner endorsement of common rules, procedures and
sanctions. The IOC was intent on getting the federations to fall
into line before the February doping summit.
	   Previous IOC guidelines recommended a two-year ban as a maximum

China's defense minister soothes regional fears over military might

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ China's defense minister sought on Friday to
soothe fears in Asia over his country's military might by
describing its substantial armed forces as a relatively small,
non-threatening power undergoing important reforms.
	   ``China will never seek to be a superpower,'' said Minister of
National Defense Chi Haotian in a speech in Singapore on China's
military policy. ``China will never pose a threat to other
countries.''
	   Speaking in Mandarin, Chi said Asia's largest nation will
continue to focus on boosting its economy, and military expenditure
will be subordinated to national development.
	   ``Compared to the United States and Japan, China's defense
budget is very small indeed,'' he said.
	   In 1998, the country spent about dlrs 11 billion on defense,
compared to about dlrs 42 billion by Japan and dlrs 255 billion by
the United States, according to Chi.
	   And unlike other military world powers, China lacks the ability
to mount a long-range attack and maintains no troops or facilities
overseas, he said.
	   Despite this, the country has a huge army, with about 1.2
million people in uniform.
	   Recently-implemented reforms that remove the People's Liberation
Army's extensive commercial enterprises were extremely important,
Chi said.
	   ``These commercial activities brought some very negative
influences and effects into the PLA,'' he said.
	   The army ventured into commerce in the 1980s to supplement
declining government outlays as China concentrated on modernizing
its backward economy.
	   By the early 1990s, revenues from such enterprises _ in
everything from hotels to discos and mobile phone networks _
supplied a third of the PLA's operating expenses, and had raised
the specter of growing corruption in the military.
	   To sustain regional stability, Chi reiterated China's long-held
belief that countries should refrain from interfering in the
internal affairs of other nations.
	   Asia's security remains ``relatively stable'' even though the
region is struggling through its worst economic crisis in decades,
he added.
	   On the dispute over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea _
claimed by China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam _
Chi said, ``Common development (of the islands) is the most
realistic way to deal with the problem.''
	   Chi is on a four-day trip to the Southeast Asian city-state, and
has met his Singapore counterpart Tony Tan in addition to Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

Russia's ex-spy chief sues billionaire businessman for libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ex-chief of Russia's Federal Security Service
has filed a libel suit against a controversial business mogul for
alleging that secret agents were plotting to kill him, the former
spy said Friday.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a billionaire with close Kremlin ties, made
the accusations earlier this month in an open letter to Vladimir
Putin, the current head of the security service, known by its
Russian acronym as the FSB.
	   The service is the main successor of the Soviet KGB and employs
many of its former agents.
	   In the open letter, published by the daily Kommersant,
Berezovsky claimed that many top FSB officers share a communist
ideology and dream of undoing democratic reforms and restoring the
repressive security system employed during Soviet times.
	   Former FSB chief Nikolai Kovalyov _ one of the people Berezovsky
has mentioned in the alleged plot _ adamantly denied the
allegations Friday, and said he had sued for libel, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``An unabashed mud-slinging campaign is being waged against law
enforcement bodies,'' Kovalyov told a news conference. ``The
professional reputation of Russia's FSB has been roiled, (the
service) has been unfairly portrayed in black.''
	   Kovalyov said he may also request that a criminal case be opened
against Berezovsky, Interfax reported.
	   The scandal began when FSB Lt. Col. Alexander Litvinenko
reported to President Boris Yeltsin's office this spring that his
commanding officer had ordered him to kill Berezovsky.
	   The chief prosecutor's office started an investigation, then
suspended it for lack of evidence.
	   The officer who allegedly gave the order to kill Berezovsky,
Alexander Kamyshnikov, deputy head of the FSB's department for
organized crime, has denied the claims.
	   But Litvinenko again went public with the allegations, calling a
news conference last week to accuse his bosses of ordering
kidnappings, extortion and contract murders, including a plot to
kill Berezovsky.
	   Several other officers _ one of them wearing ski mask to the
news conference _ supported Litvinenko's account.
	   Following the allegations, Yeltsin ordered Putin, the FSB chief,
to look into reports illegal FSB activities, including alleged
plots to kill Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky was injured in 1994 when a bomb destroyed his armored
Mercedes sedan and killed his driver. The case has never been
solved.
	   Berezovsky, whose business interests range from oil to cars to
media holdings, is also executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a loose alliance of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

	   Youhanna, playing in his sixth test, was unbeaten on 74 _
surpassing his previous personal best of 64 also against Zimbabwe
in March.
	   The right-handed Youhanna, who hit medium-fast Henry Olonga for
three attractive square cuts to point boundary in four deliveries,
hammered 13 fours off 153 balls in 211 minutes. He was dropped by
Neil Johnson at second slip when he had scored just a single.
	   Ahmed, who has two centuries against Australia in the last two
tests (155 and 120 not out), hit 13 fours and a six off spinner
Andrew Whittall. He made his half century off 91 balls and in total
faced 128 deliveries during his 194 minutes at the wicket.
	   On a wicket which suited the likes of strokeplayers, Zimbabwean
bowlers pitched too short to Ahmed, who pulled, drove and cut with
vicious power.
	   ``I am the sort of player who likes to play strokes. The wicket
had an even bounce and the ball came onto the bat at a good
height,'' said Ahmed, who recorded his 11th test half century.
	   Pakistan had lost three wickets before lunch for 109, before
Ahmed and Youhanna rallied it with a run-a-minute 90 runs. That
took Pakistan to 199 without further loss.
	   Zimbabwe took three wickets in the last session as Ahmed missed
his century and Moin Khan (15) was smartly held at deep fine leg by
Mpumelelo Mbangwa, which gave Olonga his first wicket.
	   Twenty-four-year-old Heath Streak became the first Zimbabwean to
take 100 test wickets when he had Azhar Mahmood (11) caught behind.
	   Earlier, Saeed Anwar and captain Aamir Sohail put on 45 runs for
the first wicket before Mbangwa got the breakthrough off his first
ball of the match.
	   Sohail, who made 15 got an outside edge and wicketkeeper Andy
Flower held onto a brilliant diving catch in front of first slip.
	   Mbangwa, 22-year-old right-arm seamer, then took the wicket of
Inzamamul Haq, who hit three fours in Johnson's one over, before
falling leg before after scoring 19 off 25 balls.
	   Between Mbangwa's two wickets, Johnson uprooted Anwar (36) off
stump off a big gap when the left-hander attempted to play an off
drive.

Buzek approves candidate for transport minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Tadeusz Syryjczyk, Poland's first
post-communist economic minister, was nominated Friday to become
the new transport minister after the previous one resigned over
labor influence on plans to restructure the state railway company.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said he asked President Aleksander
Kwasniewski to approve the nomination.
	   An adviser to Kwasniewski, who is visiting Morocco until Dec. 3,
said he expected the president to approve the appointment upon his
return.
	   Syryjczyk, 50, is a leader of the Freedom Union, a junior
partner in the Solidarity-led governing coalition.
	   A specialist in industry and computers, he was the economic
minister in Poland's first democratic government in 1989 and now
heads the Freedom Union parliamentary caucus.
	   Syryjczyk would succeed Eugeniusz Morawski, also of the Freedom
Union, who resigned Monday in a dispute over the influence of
organized labor in government plans to reform the heavily indebted,
inefficient state railway system.
	   The government is negotiating terms of restructuring the
railway, Polskie Koleje Panstwowe, with labor unions that oppose
job losses, a significant element of the reform plan.
	   In recent years, the railway company inherited from the
communist era has been cutting train connections and increasing
ticket prices to prevent further losses.

 &UR; Fate of Kurdish leader focus of German, Italian summit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting started; protests planned for Saturday;
ADDS background on German terror charges, byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Despite pressure from Italy, Germany will not
extradite rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan on terror charges
for fear of sparking unrest among Germany's 2 million Turks _ about
one-quarter of them Kurds, a government spokesman said Friday.
	   Ocalan's fate was to be discussed at a meeting Friday between
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema. While Schroeder said Thursday he would not take a position
on Ocalan until after the meeting, the spokesman said Germany
remained opposed to the extradition.
	   As the politicians spoke in Bonn, thousands of Turkish Kurds
began gathering there for a rally supporting Ocalan, the leader of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a
14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The conflict has killed
37,000 people.
	   Police expected 30,000 protesters on Friday, and Kurdish groups
have announced protests for Sunday in several cities around
Germany.
	   Ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and murder charges in Turkey,
where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested Nov. 12 when he
arrived at the Rome airport aboard a flight from Moscow.
	   A Rome court freed him last Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant
because Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to
countries where they face the death penalty. The decision enraged
many in Turkey who consider Ocalan their most-wanted criminal.
Protesters have burned Italian clothes and cars and launched
boycotts against Italian products.
	   For now, Ocalan is under police surveillance at a Rome villa.
Judges have ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give
Germany time to mull over extradition. Germany, as well as the
other countries in the European Union, does not have the death
penalty.
	   Germany has two arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one
for a single murder charged in 1990 and another issued last
weekend. German media reports say the new, broader charges include
``liquidation of a string of dissidents'' in Germany in the 1980s
and a string of arson attacks in 1993. The attacks led Germany to
ban the PKK as a terrorist group the same year.
	   The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany, Mehmet
Tanriverdi, has asked the German government to help reach a
political settlement in Turkey on the question of Kurdish autonomy.
He also says Ocalan should be given asylum in Italy and be free to
travel in Europe.

Singapore's cost-cutting measures may boost Japanese investments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's cost-cutting package introduced
this week may boost Japanese investments in the city-state, a
Japanese business official said Friday.
	   Takashi Imai, head of the influential Keidanren, Japan
Federation of Economic Organizations, told reporters the measures
will attract interest from the business community in Japan.
	   Singapore has begun a wide-reaching program to cut business
costs by about 10.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.3 billion),
which should make the city-state more competitive and interesting
to investors.
	   Imai, chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., said the rebate on capital
goods investments for hi-tech industries was especially attractive.
	   Direct investments from Japan and the rest of east Asia last
year increased by an 150 billion yen (dlrs 1.2 billion) to 750
billion yen (dlrs 6.1 billion), with most of it engaged in Korea,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
	   Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong met earlier Friday with
Imai and other Japanese businessmen.
	   Goh called for more Japanese investments in those Southeast
Asian nations that have responded well to economic restructuring
and reform, Singapore TV reported.

Italy's justice minister suggests international tribunal to try
</HEADLINE>
Kurdish leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's justice minister on Friday suggested
resolving a diplomatic dispute over the fate of Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan by setting up an international tribunal in
Italy to try Ocalan.
	   Both Germany and Turkey have issued arrest warrants for Ocalan,
who is charged with terrorism. But Germany doesn't want him and
Italy's laws prohibit it from extraditing someone to a country
where they face the death penalty, as is the case with Ocalan in
Turkey.
	   This means Italy is stuck with the rebel leader and must decide
whether to accept his request for political asylum.
	   On Thursday, Italy's foreign minister contended Italy couldn't
grant Ocalan asylum because he cannot be considered a victim of
persecution.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema is still hopeful that Germany will ask
for his extradition and says Italy won't make a decision on the
asylum request until Dec. 22, when Germany's warrant expires.
	   Germany has repeatedly said it won't seek extradition because
the move is likely to spark violence between its 2 million Turks
and 400,000 Kurds.
	   Ocalan was arrested upon his arrival in Rome two weeks ago on a
flight from Moscow. He was detained in a military hospital for a
week and then transferred to a Rome villa where he is under police
surveillance while he awaits a decision from the Interior Ministry
on his asylum request.
	   Turkey is furious over Italy's refusal to extradite Ocalan, its
No. 1 fugitive, and has launched demonstrations and boycotts of
Italian goods.
	   On Thursday Turkey's caretaker government tuned down its tone
and invited Italy's premier to attend a Champions League soccer
game in Istanbul Wednesday.
	   Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto, member of a Communist party
that wants to grant Ocalan asylum, was quoted in the Repubblica
daily as saying an international tribunal ``would be an opportunity
for Ocalan to explain his position to the entire international
community.''
	   Diliberto said the European Union would oversee the tribunal to
``guarantee impartiality.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

Central banker forecasts low Hungarian inflation for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Inflation in Hungary will drop to
single digits next year for the first time since 1987 unless
Western European economic growth slows sharply, the chief central
banker said Friday.
	   ``This can come about if economic growth is 4 percent to 5
percent, and the current account deficit does not exceed 2 billion
dollars,'' Gyoergy Suranyi said.
	   Inflation for 1998 is predicted at around 15 percent.
	   Suranyi said it's too early to consider phasing out the
crawling-peg devaluation system for the Hungarian forint. Under the
system, the central bank devalues the forint by 0.7 percent
monthly, against currencies including the dollar and the German
mark.
	   Suranyi emphasized that Hungary needs to maintain strict
monetary policy to encourage sustainable economic growth.

Nigeria establishes petroleum watchdog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The Nigerian government is establishing a
high-level monitoring team to track the illegal sale of gasoline
and other petrol byproducts.
	   The Federal Petroleum Monitoring Unit, under the direct
supervision of the military, will soon be in operation, the
government announced Friday.
	   The new body will replace an earlier task force which had proved
ineffective in curbing the profiteering black market sale of fuel,
said Maj. Gen. Yunana Nom, the chief of training services at the
defense ministry.
	   Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producing
states, it is faced with chronic fuel shortages due to a mix of
corruption, theft, neglect and mismanagement. To fill the gap,
profiteers sell smuggled fuel at vastly inflated prices.
	   The monitoring team will oversee all aspects of petroleum
marketing and sales in Nigeria and will have the power to
investigate related crimes, Nom said.
	   ``We wish to appeal to all Nigerians to bear with the government
as we seek some effective solutions to the current crisis,'' Nom
said.
	   Nigeria's four oil refineries are all idle due to disrepair,
while the country is forced to import processed fuel.
	   Throughout the country, petrol stations are running dry and
motorists are desperately searching for alternative sources of
gasoline.
	   Many people have resorted to buying fuel on the black market,
sold in glass bottles at up to a thousand times the regular price
of 12 cents a liter.
	   Nigeria's endemic poverty further exacerbates the problem, with
people living in the oil-rich Niger River delta stealing oil from
pipeline facilities.
	   An estimated 700 people died last month when oil from a leaking
pipeline erupted into flames. The victims were scavenging for
spilled oil.
	   The current fuel crisis has become politically charged with the
opposition Nigeria Labor Congress warning the ruling military
government not to hike petrol prices.
	   ``We call on the federal government to drop the idea
forthwith,'' said Congress Chairman Godwin Workeh.
	   Hints about a possible fuel price hike came from new military
leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who recently said the increases
were necessary and could be introduced as early as next year.
	   One of the reasons for the proposed increase is the cheap price
of Nigerian gasoline compared to its neighbor countries.
Inexpensive Nigeria fuel is often smuggled across land borders,
depriving Nigeria of the gasoline and worsening the shortage.

Germany to discuss aerospace merger with France during summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany prefers a three-way merger of the
European aerospace industry, including France and Britain, and will
advise French officials during a summit next week, a source said
Friday.
	   However, the source said if Britain and Germany come to an
agreement before France is ready, Germany would insist that the
``door be held open'' for French participation later.
	   The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger to compete with the Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advance
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.
	   Germany's assurance that the French can join in at a later date
should bolster France's efforts to be included in the joint
European industry.
	   The two sides will discuss the issue at a German-French summit
to be held Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 in Potsdam. German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac, French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, as well as finance ministers and economics ministers
will attend the summit.
	   The French government earlier this year announced it would merge
Aerospatiale with Matra Hautes Technologies and float a portion of
the merged company on the stock market. That would bring the
government's stake in the merged company to below 50 percent,
although that figure could be reduced.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Shaun Pollock took two more
wickets for only three more runs and South Africa bolwed out the
West Indies for 261 before lunch Friday, the second day of their
first test.
	   Pollock, whose morning spill destroyed the top order of West
Indies on Thursday, finished with five for 54 to clean up the
tailend as well, and South Africa replied with 53 for one before
the first break at Wanderers Stadium.
	   Allan Donald took the remaining West Indies wicket and with
Pollock dismissed the Caribbean tourists for only 12 more runs, as

	   The day had its high moment for the West Indians as well.
Courtney Walsh equalled Malcolm Marshall's team record with his
376th test wicket, getting Adam Bacher caught behind for one.
Bacher fell after South Africa had put up only 10, another
disappointing opening partnership for the host.
	   The last reasonable start to an innings for South Africa came in
March this year, against Sri Lanka, when Gary Kirsten and Gerhardus
Liebenberg put on 89.
	   Kirsten was on 22 and Jacques Kallis 26 when the lunch break was

	   BRINDISI, Italy (AP) _ A speeding motor boat with smugglers at
the helm crashed into a dinghy filled with would-be immigrants
Friday, killing at least three people, including a baby.
	   Another four would-be immigrants were missing and feared dead.
	   Ten others managed to swim to a nearby oil platform and were
later taken ashore by the coast guard. Three of them were
hospitalized, with one reportedly in serious condition.
	   News reports said the immigrants were Albanians fleeing Kosovo,
and had left from the Albanian port of Durres during the night. The
accident occurred about 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Brindisi,
on Italy's southern coast.
	   The smugglers, who were unhurt, sped away from the scene
immediately after the collision, the reports said.
	   Authorities also detained six men after finding some 250
kilograms (550 pounds) of marijuana and 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of
hashish aboard two dinghies abandoned by the group after a police
chase.
	   Also Friday, police blocked some 240 would-be immigrants who
arrived on dinghies along the coastline of the Puglia region, at
the heel of the Italian peninsula. Three smugglers caught driving
immigrants to railway stations were arrested.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants fleeing persecution or war at
home have reached Italy's shores in recent years. The immigrants,
most of them Kurds, Northern Africans or Kosovo refugees, usually
pay smugglers huge fees for the trip.

Galatasaray eager to host Juventus

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Galatasaray's Romanian strikers on Friday
assured Juventus players of their safety during next week's
Champions League match, while police prevented anti-Italian
protests to ease down tensions.
	   ``Don't be afraid, come Zidane,'' said two Romanian strikers of
Galatasaray, Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorge Hagi, in a joint
statement published by the daily sports newspaper, Fanatik. ``We
are your guarantee.''
	   Zidane and several other Juventus players have refused to play
the match in Turkey because of anti-Italian sentiment running high
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader,
Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' Zidane said. ``I
speak only for myself, but all of my teammates think the same way.
Galatasaray-Juventus should be played in a country other than
Turkey.''
	   UEFA already has moved the game originally slated for Wednesday,
to Dec. 2.
	   Reportedly Juventus was still seeking a neutral venue but
Turkish police seem determined to reduce the tension and blocked a
group of demonstrators from reaching the Italian consulate on
Thursday.
	   On Friday, Turkey's sports ministry announced that Lennart
Johansson, president of UEFA, assured Turkish officials that the
game would be played in Istanbul next Wednesday.
	   Police had tolerated violent protests over the past week around
the country, where demonstrators set fire to a Fiat car, a
motorbike and numerous Italian flags and silk, Italian-made ties.
	   Sports minister Yucel Seckiner has also invited his Italian
counterpart Giovanna Melandri to attend the match. It was not clear
if she would accept the invitation.
	   ``We will play at home,'' said Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim.
``But if this not happens, we will topple them anywhere.''
	   Galatasaray has charged that the UEFA decision favored the
Italian team. Reports suggested that the decision by soccer's
European governing body allowed injured Juventus players time to
get back into shape.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.
	   Meantime Terim is expected to fly to Italy to watch Juventus,
which has reached the European Champions Cup final three straight
times and won once, against Bologna over the weekend.
	   Galatasaray's league match against Besiktas on Sunday has been
postponed by the soccer federation.
	   Italy objects to Ocalan's extradition as he faces death penalty
in Turkey for capital crimes.
	   Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12, is the leader of
the Kurdistan Workers Party which has been waging a guerrilla war
for autonomy in Turkey's southeast for 14 years. The conflict has
claimed nearly 37,000 lives.

Iran says Americans attacked last week were businessmen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Friday that a group of Americans
were attacked by Islamic militants last week were members of a
business delegation exploring investment opportunities.
	   The acknowledgement by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi constituted the first official description of the 13
Americans, who left the country a day after the attack Saturday.
	   They were traveling in a bus in Tehran when radicals chanting
``Death to America'' and wielding iron bars hurled stones at the
vehicle, smashing windows and injuring some of the occupants.
	   Until now, Iranian officials had maintained that the Americans
were tourists.
	   The attack is believed to have been triggered by reports in
hard-line newspapers accusing the visitors of being members of the
Central Intelligence Agency posing as tourists. U.S. officials in
Washington denied that any of the Americans were government
officials or had links to the CIA.
	   The Americans were allowed into Iran to increase pressure
against U.S. sanctions that ban American companies from investing
in Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Asefi as
saying.
	   Asefi said the Foreign Ministry initially denied the presence of
the U.S. delegation because the visit had not been coordinated with
it. He did not identify the businessmen further.
	   The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group that was dormant for
many years, claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly
after the 1979 revolution.

Sweden offers a flexible lease plan for its fighter planes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Swedish Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydov
on Friday offered Poland a few options for using or leasing
Sweden's Viggen and Gripen fighter planes to help Poland adjust to
NATO standards.
	   Sydov said Poland could lease the planes or only use them for
training pilots in Sweden and Poland. He gave no cost of the offer,
which also included training flight controllers, technicians and
mechanics.
	   Poland, one of three former Warsaw Pact countries scheduled to
join NATO in April, needs Western planes to replace the Soviet-made
MIG fighters it has been using.
	   In addition to upgrading equipment and weapons, Poland is
training its troops to meet NATO standards.
	   Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz said using the Swedish
planes for training carried no obligation to purchase the aircraft.
He said the training would allow Polish pilots to get acquainted
with NATO flight procedures.

Kurdish rebel supporters end hunger strike in Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than a dozen supporters of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan ended a nearly two-week hunger strike
Friday, a Kurdish spokesman said.
	   The hunger strike was called off to coincide with the 20th
anniversary of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
waging a battle for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, said Rojhat
Laser, a representative of the National Liberation Front of
Kurdistan, the PKK's political wing.
	   The protesters gathered in a central Athens square after
Ocalan's Nov. 12 arrest in Rome. Turkey is demanding Ocalan's
extradition from Italy, where he is seeking political asylum.
	   The PKK supporters began the hunger strike Nov. 14 to oppose the
extradition request.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in fighting between
Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels since 1984.

Iraq to reject non-weapons requests by UNSCOM

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq says it will turn down any request by
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that is unrelated to
disarmament or that jeopardizes the country's security.
	   In a television interview broadcast late Thursday, Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Baghdad also rejects the
five conditions set by U.S. President Bill Clinton after calling
off the Nov. 14 military strikes on Iraq.
	   Sahhaf said the government is committed only to a U.N.
resolution that links the removal of sanctions to a certification
by U.N. weapons inspectors that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.
	   ``This wretched person (Butler) now thinks he has the backing of
the United States of America in accordance with the points raised
by its president,'' Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq evaded the military strikes by allowing the resumption of
inspections by the United Nations Special Commission after a
two-week hiatus.
	   Sahhaf said Butler and the United States are mistaken if they
believe Iraq's decision to cooperate s gives them the right to
obtain ``a yes'' answer from Iraq to every demand.
	   But Sahhaf was quick to add that Iraq is committed to
cooperating with UNSCOM.
	   Cooperation with the inspectors was one of the five conditions
that Clinton laid out in calling off the strikes. Clinton also
demanded that Iraq should provide UNSCOM all documents it needs.
	   Soon after UNSCOM resumed its work in Iraq, Butler asked for
papers that he says are related to Iraq's biological and chemical
weapons programs.
	   Iraq says most of the documents in question do not exist and
those in its possession will not be handed over because they are
part of its national security.
	   ``Butler has resorted to a new ploy: that is the implementation
of the points made by Clinton,'' Sahhaf said.
	   He said a deal his government signed with U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan in February compels Butler and his inspectors to respect
``all of Iraq's national security concerns'' in addition to matters
related to its sovereignty.
	   The Feb. 23 pact opened presidential sites to the inspectors and
had also averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   On Friday, more U.N. inspectors arrived in Baghdad as others
went out on field trips to ensure that no illegal activities are
taking place at suspected Iraqi weapons sites.

Farmers protest against cheap imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Hundreds of trucks and heavy
equipment blocked traffic in smaller towns and villages Friday
across the Czech Republic in a protest against imports of cheap
pork from European Union countries.
	   The protest, scheduled to last two hours, was aimed at ``forcing
the government to better protect its farmers,'' Drahomir Tobias of
the Czech Agriculture Chamber told the public Czech Radio.
	   ``Prices of a number of commodities have already dropped sharply
due to the subsidized imports from abroad,'' Tobias said.
	   Farmers claim the Czech market has been flooded with cheap pork
products from abroad and most Czech pork producers will go bankrupt
if the state doesn't intervene.
	   The government Wednesday raised duties on certain pork products
from 15 percent to 40 percent, but farmers said it isn't enough.
	   ``The protests are aimed against the methods of the EU and
against importers of cheap pork,'' the chairman of the Agriculture
Chamber, Vaclav Hlavacek, said.
	   The Czech Republic has witnessed a sharp increase in pork
imports in the past two months as EU countries have lost their
Russian markets.

Ex-spy appointed new chief of arms-trading monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Russia's top
arms-trading official Friday and appointed a former KGB
intelligence officer as its new chief, the Kremlin said.
	   Yevgeny Ananyev, chief of the Rosvooruzheniye state arms-trading
monopoly since August 1997, had long been rumored to be on his way
out, blamed for a slump in Russia's weapons exports.
	   Yeltsin fired Ananyev and replaced him with Georgy Rapota, a
long-time aide to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, presidential
press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin told a news conference Friday.
	   According to the business daily Kommersant, Rapota, 54,
graduated from Moscow Bauman Technical University and in 1966
joined the KGB. During Soviet times, he worked as a KGB spy in the
United States and Finland, the newspaper said.
	   Primakov, who in 1991-1996 headed Russia's Foreign Intelligence
Service, a KGB successor agency, appointed Rapota his deputy in
1993. Earlier this year, Rapota was appointed deputy secretary of
the presidential security council, where he was in charge of
monitoring nuclear and missile non-proliferation.
	   Kommersant said Rapota's former colleagues extolled him as an
``intellectual who isn't afraid of making decisions.''
	   Rapota said Friday he would ensure the continuity of
Rosvooruzheniye's work and observe all its obligations.
	   He said he wasn't surprised by his appointment, because he had
been approached about the job some time ago, the Interfax news
agency reported.

Twenty-four people missing off Moroccan coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Twenty-four people were missing at sea
Friday off the coast of northern Morocco after the boat bringing
them to Spain sank, Spanish officials said.
	   The vessel had just set off from Tangiers late Wednesday when it
went down about a mile from that city's port, a spokesman for
Spanish maritime rescue services said.
	   At the request of Moroccan authorities, two Spanish helicopters
and a plane aided in search and rescue operations on Thursday, the
spokesman said. But on Friday the Moroccans did not ask for help,
he added.
	   Two Moroccans picked up by a Moroccan vessel after the boat sank
said another 24 people had been on the boat, the official said.
	   One body was found floating near the Tangiers port.
	   Every year thousands of people fleeing poverty try to cross the
Strait of Gibraltar or the Mediterranean from North Africa and slip
into Europe. Almost all of them are men and most are from Morocco.
Most travel in overcrowded single-motor boats, and many are
believed to drown.
	   Those caught during the trip or in Spain are repatriated.

Jiang expresses disappointment over lack of written apology

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The tortured history between Japan and China should
not be ignored in the two countries' rush to build stronger
relations, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Japanese lawmakers
Friday.
	   Jiang met with legislators the day after Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi offered a verbal apology for Japanese World War II
aggression in China _ a statement that broke no new ground in
settling grievances between the two.
	   Many conservatives in Japan are opposed to an explicit apology
to China, and some have accused Beijing of perpetuating historical
wounds that were already settled and should be forgotten.
	   But Jiang _ the first Chinese head of state to visit Japan since
World War II _ said facing the past is crucial to improved ties.
	   At a morning meeting with Japanese legislators on Friday, Jiang
touched on the issue of Japan's invasion, referring to history as a
``mirror'' that was important for the future of bilateral
relations.
	   ``China is said to take up the historical issue too often, but I
don't agree with such a view,'' Jiang was quoted by Kyodo News
agency as telling Japanese Communist Party leader Tetsuzo Fuwa.
	   In a speech at a welcoming dinner Friday night, Jiang said both
countries must understand past conflicts to move ahead.
	   ``By making history a lesson for both China and Japan, and by
preventing tragedy from being repeated, (the two countries) can
develop long-lasting friendship for the first time,'' Kyodo quoted
him as saying.
	   Tokyo took over northeast China in 1931 and then launched an
all-out invasion of China proper in 1937. Japanese troops massacred
civilians and Japanese doctors experimented on prisoners of war.
	   Obuchi's oral apology on Thursday did not go beyond a similar
statement issued in 1995. A joint written declaration included a
more ambiguously worded apology saying Tokyo was ``conscious of its
responsibility'' for suffering caused to the Chinese people.
	   Japanese media reported Jiang expressed his disappointment with
the communique by agreeing with Japanese opposition leader Naoto
Kan on Friday that it was not contrite enough.
	   The treatment offered Beijing contrasted with that afforded
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung when he came to Japan in
October. The two sides signed a joint written statement in which
Tokyo apologized directly for its 1910-1945 colonization of the
Korean peninsula.
	   ``China is sure to be upset,'' said Takehiko Yamamoto, a
professor of international politics at Waseda University. ``For
China, the first-ever visit by its head of state is an extremely
important event, and the apology was one of the main issues.''
	   It was not immediately clear why the apology for China did not
match up with the one for Korea.
	   But Japanese wartime actions in the two countries are seen
differently in Japan. While Tokyo took over and directly ruled
Korea, China was widely seen as a wartime adversary.
	   Revisionist historians and politicians claim Chinese accounts of
Japanese atrocities are overstated and are part of a campaign to
squeeze compensation and aid out of Tokyo.
	   The absence of a full expression of remorse in the joint
statement was widely interpreted as an indication Obuchi caved in
to opposition from the party's conservatives.
	   ``China is sure to come away with an impression Obuchi is unable
to control his party,'' Yamamoto said.
	   Japan is hoping that its promise of big loans to help Chinese
economic development will offset the diplomatic setback. Obuchi
offered China new loans of 390 billion yen (dlrs 3.2 billion) for
28 environmental, farming and other development projects for
1999-2000.
	   Obuchi also agreed not to support Taiwanese independence and
reassured Jiang that Japan's security arrangement with the United
States was only for defense.
	   Jiang, who arrived Wednesday, enjoyed lighter activities after
talks with lawmakers on Friday, visiting a technology exhibit put
on by the Mitsubishi Group and touring the massive Aqualine
expressway-tunnel that spans Tokyo Bay.
	   He leaves Tokyo on Saturday for visits to two northern Japanese
cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

Japanese Finance Minister Miyazawa hints he may resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the 79-year-old
party elder drafted to put together Japan's economic recovery, said
Friday that he would step down after only several months on the
job.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister who also served as finance
chief in the 1980s, said he would also quit as head of a major
faction in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
	   ``I have been telling senior members of my faction that I'm
ready to hand over my position as faction head,'' Miyazawa told
reporters. ``Once I resign, it wouldn't be appropriate to stay in
the Cabinet.''
	   It was unclear when that would happen. News reports Friday
quoted Miyazawa as having said he planned to stay put until work is
completed on Japan's 1999 fiscal year budget, expected next month.
	   But Miyazawa later told reporters he hasn't decided exactly when
he will step down as faction head. He said he will time the move so
that it doesn't affect the passage of crucial bills aimed at
jump-starting the economy.
	   ``I am well aware of the very difficult situation the Japanese
economy is now facing. Thus I will see that (my resignation) will
not cause any delay (in economic stimulus steps),'' Miyazawa said.
	   Kyodo News agency quoted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi as saying
he still hadn't been informed directly of Miyazawa's intentions.
	   Japan is battling its deepest recession since World War II. When
Obuchi took office this summer, he turned to Miyazawa for his long
experience in finance and economics.
	   Miyazawa's return as head of the powerful ministry was heralded
by some commentators.
	   Others, however, criticized the move, blaming Miyazawa for
fueling Japan's asset-inflated economic ``bubble'' in the late
1980s, the eventual collapse of which is still adversely affecting
the nation's economy.

Russia's ex-spy chief sues billionaire businessman for libel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berezovsky comment in new grafs 8-9. Improves
translation of Kovalyov quote in graf 6. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ex-chief of Russia's Federal Security Service
has filed a libel suit against a controversial business mogul for
alleging that secret agents were plotting to kill him, the former
spy said Friday.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a billionaire with close Kremlin ties, made
the accusations earlier this month in an open letter to Vladimir
Putin, the current head of the security service, known by its
Russian acronym as the FSB.
	   The service is the main successor of the Soviet KGB and employs
many of its former agents.
	   In the open letter, published by the daily Kommersant,
Berezovsky claimed that many top FSB officers share a communist
ideology and dream of undoing democratic reforms and restoring the
repressive security system employed during Soviet times.
	   Former FSB chief Nikolai Kovalyov _ one of the people Berezovsky
mentioned in the alleged plot _ adamantly denied the allegations
Friday, and said he had sued for libel, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   ``An unabashed mud-slinging campaign is being waged against law
enforcement bodies,'' Kovalyov told a news conference. ``The
professional reputation of Russia's FSB has been soiled, (the
service) has been unfairly portrayed in black.''
	   Kovalyov said he may also request that a criminal case be opened
against Berezovsky, Interfax reported.
	   Berezovsky expressed satisfaction that the matter has been taken
out in the open, Interfax reported.
	   ``It is good that Kovalyov has understood that serious issues
must be discussed in an open and civilized way,'' Berezovsky was
quoted as saying.
	   The scandal began when FSB Lt. Col. Alexander Litvinenko
reported to President Boris Yeltsin's office this spring that his
commanding officer had ordered him to kill Berezovsky.
	   The chief prosecutor's office started an investigation, then
suspended it for lack of evidence.
	   The officer who allegedly gave the order to kill Berezovsky,
Alexander Kamyshnikov, deputy head of the FSB's department for
organized crime, has denied the claims.
	   But Litvinenko again went public with the allegations, calling a
news conference last week to accuse his bosses of ordering
kidnappings, extortion and contract murders, including a plot to
kill Berezovsky.
	   Several other officers _ one of them wearing ski mask to the
news conference _ supported Litvinenko's account.
	   Following the allegations, Yeltsin ordered Putin, the FSB chief,
to look into reports of illegal FSB activities, including the
alleged plots to kill Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky was injured in 1994 when a bomb destroyed his armored
Mercedes sedan and killed his driver. The case has never been
solved.
	   Berezovsky, whose business interests range from oil to cars to
media holdings, is also executive secretary of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, a loose alliance of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

Walsh passes record in SAfrica-WIndies cricket
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later play &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Courtney Walsh has become the
most successful bowler in West Indian cricket history, taking three
wickets on the second day in the first test against South Africa at
the Wanderers Stadium Friday.
	   His success left South Africa at 138 for three at tea, chasing
the West Indies first Innings score of 261. When he had opener Adam
Bacher caught behind for one, he equaled Malcom Marshall's 375
career haul, Then, in his second spell, he removed Jacques Kallis
(53) and Darryl Cullinan (8) to claim the record for his own. His
first gesture was to salute Marshall, who was watching from the
West Indies dressing room.
	   At the crease at tea were Gary Kirsten on a well-built 57 and
Hansie Cronje on six.
	   Earlier in the day, South Africa had quickly removed the West
Indies tail, as the visitors moved from 249 for seven overnight to
261 all out. Shaun Pollock took five for 54 to be the best of the
South African bowlers.
	   South Africa replied with 53 for one before the first break at
Wanderers Stadium.
	   Allan Donald took the remaining West Indies wicket and with
Pollock dismissed the Caribbean tourists for only 12 more runs, as
they tried to build on their overnight score of 249 for seven.
	   The last reasonable start to an innings for South Africa came in
March this year, against Sri Lanka, when Kirsten and Gerhardus
Liebenberg put on 89.
	   Kirsten was on 22 and Jacques Kallis 26 when the lunch break was
called.

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2nd graf to UPDATE with Mandela having gone to wrong
site to register; EDITS 16th graf to CONFORM &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Dogged by confusion and
disorganization, election officials pressed ahead Friday with the
creation of the first voter roll to include South Africans of all
colors.
	   Even President Nelson Mandela went to the wrong registration
site, according to Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African
National Congress. He blamed election officials for sending Mandela
to the wrong place and said he would probably have to register
again.
	   People muddled their way to registration stations across five
northern provinces, home to about half the 25 million eligible
voters at the start of a three-day registration period. The other
half of the country registers Dec. 4-6.
	   Some had the wrong identity papers. Others couldn't find their
venue, published in newspapers only Friday. A few stations didn't
have enough staff to open, and difficulties with the hand-held
bar-code readers were reported.
	   But it appeared the problems were scattered, and the majority of
people at registration stations made it through in five to 10
minutes.
	   Election officials were not surprised by the problems. The
Independent Electoral Commission, up and running only 1 1-2 years
ago, has had to organize the registration with limited funds.
	   In the first all-race elections, which ended apartheid in 1994
and brought the African National Congress to power, people simply
had to show up at the polls. Establishing the voter roll is a major
step in the country's transformation from white minority rule to
true democracy.
	   ``I have seen problems this morning,'' said Johann Kriegler, the
commission's chairman. ``It's an immensely complicated exercise.
... We'll patch it up. We'll make it good before we're finished
with it,'' he told Associated Press Television News.
	   Registration was supposed to be only Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. But lack of personnel, uncertainty among people over where
to register and the large numbers of people without the proper ID
books caused the commission to spread out the process, adding a
three-day period in January and another in February.
	   The military was called out to help civil servants staff the
stations.
	   Seven air force personnel manned a venue at a lawn bowling club
in the exclusive white suburb of Johannesburg. By 9 a.m., two hours
into registration, 85 people had come through, with three turned
back because they lacked the latest generation of IDs -- which have
a bar code read by a scanner.
	   ``It's just so disorganized,'' said Gilda Lee Fritz, 47, who was
turned away. ``I'm really upset by this. I'm telling you, it's a
ploy to prevent certain people from voting.''
	   She meant whites. The vast majority of the millions of South
Africans without the bar-code IDs -- which the commission and ANC
established as a requirement to vote and register -- are white.
With the fall of apartheid, blacks rushed to replace their
restrictive apartheid-era IDs with the new ones.
	   The white-supported National Party, which denied the vote to
blacks while ruling under apartheid, says it will challenge the
bar-code ID requirement in court, saying the ANC is trying to deny
whites the vote.
	   ``I had to go get mine, so I don't see why others can't do the
same,'' said Bernard Mokhachene, a black executive who held up his
new ID while registering in the run-down, integrated neighborhood
of Yeoville.
	   Mandela said the National Party was ``entitled'' to challenge
the registration if it had reservations.
	   Surveys estimate about 5 million people lack the new IDs, but
the government put the number at about half that.
	   Elections are likely to take place next May, though no date has
been set.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq says it will turn down any request by
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that is unrelated to
disarmament or that jeopardizes its security.
	   In a television interview broadcast late Thursday, Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Baghdad also rejects the
five conditions set by U.S. President Bill Clinton in calling off
Nov. 14 military strikes on Iraq.
	   Sahhaf said the government is committed only to a U.N.
resolution that links the removal of sanctions to a certification
by U.N. weapons inspectors that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction. The U.N. sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   ``This wretched person (Butler) now thinks he has the backing of
the United States of America in accordance with the points raised
by its president,'' Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq evaded the military strikes by allowing the resumption of
inspections by the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, after
a two-week hiatus.
	   Sahhaf said Butler and the United States are mistaken if they
believe Iraq's decision to cooperate gives them the right to obtain
a ``yes'' answer from Iraq to every demand.
	   But Sahhaf was quick to add that Iraq is committed to
cooperating with UNSCOM.
	   Cooperation with the inspectors was one of the five conditions
that Clinton laid out in calling off the strikes. Clinton also
demanded that Iraq provide UNSCOM with all documents it needs.
	   Soon after UNSCOM resumed its work in Iraq, Butler asked for
papers that he says are related to Iraq's biological and chemical
weapons programs.
	   Iraq says most of the documents do not exist and those in its
possession will not be handed over to preserve national security.
	   ``Butler has resorted to a new ploy: that is the implementation
of the points made by Clinton,'' Sahhaf said.
	   He said a deal his government signed with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in February compels Butler and his inspectors to respect
``all of Iraq's national security concerns'' in addition to matters
related to its sovereignty.
	   The Feb. 23 pact opened presidential sites to the inspectors and
also averted U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   On Friday, more U.N. inspectors arrived in Baghdad as others
went out on field trips to ensure that no illegal activities are
taking place at suspected Iraqi weapons sites.

site to register; EDITS 16th graf to CONFORM
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Dogged by confusion and
disorganization, election officials pressed ahead Friday with the
creation of the first voter roll to include South Africans of all
colors.
	   Even President Nelson Mandela went to the wrong registration
site, according to Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African
National Congress. He blamed election officials for sending Mandela
to the wrong place and said he would probably have to register
again.
	   People muddled their way to registration stations across five
northern provinces, home to about half the 25 million eligible
voters at the start of a three-day registration period. The other
half of the country registers Dec. 4-6.
	   Some had the wrong identity papers. Others couldn't find their
venue, published in newspapers only Friday. A few stations didn't
have enough staff to open, and difficulties with the hand-held
bar-code readers were reported.
	   But it appeared the problems were scattered, and the majority of
people at registration stations made it through in five to 10
minutes.
	   Election officials were not surprised by the problems. The
Independent Electoral Commission, up and running only 1 1-2 years
ago, has had to organize the registration with limited funds.
	   In the first all-race elections, which ended apartheid in 1994
and brought the African National Congress to power, people simply
had to show up at the polls. Establishing the voter roll is a major
step in the country's transformation from white minority rule to
true democracy.
	   ``I have seen problems this morning,'' said Johann Kriegler, the
commission's chairman. ``It's an immensely complicated exercise.
... We'll patch it up. We'll make it good before we're finished
with it,'' he told Associated Press Television News.
	   Registration was supposed to be only Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. But lack of personnel, uncertainty among people over where
to register and the large numbers of people without the proper ID
books caused the commission to spread out the process, adding a
three-day period in January and another in February.
	   The military was called out to help civil servants staff the
stations.
	   Seven air force personnel manned a venue at a lawn bowling club
in the exclusive white suburb of Johannesburg. By 9 a.m., two hours
into registration, 85 people had come through, with three turned
back because they lacked the latest generation of IDs -- which have
a bar code read by a scanner.
	   ``It's just so disorganized,'' said Gilda Lee Fritz, 47, who was
turned away. ``I'm really upset by this. I'm telling you, it's a
ploy to prevent certain people from voting.''
	   She meant whites. The vast majority of the millions of South
Africans without the bar-code IDs -- which the commission and ANC
established as a requirement to vote and register -- are white.
With the fall of apartheid, blacks rushed to replace their
restrictive apartheid-era IDs with the new ones.
	   The white-supported National Party, which denied the vote to
blacks while ruling under apartheid, says it will challenge the
bar-code ID requirement in court, saying the ANC is trying to deny
whites the vote.
	   ``I had to go get mine, so I don't see why others can't do the
same,'' said Bernard Mokhachene, a black executive who held up his
new ID while registering in the run-down, integrated neighborhood
of Yeoville.
	   Mandela said the National Party was ``entitled'' to challenge
the registration if it had reservations.
	   Surveys estimate 5 million people lack the new IDs, but the
government put the number at about half that.
	   Elections are likely to take place next May, though no date has
been set.

Surgery on Italian striker Del Piero called a success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAIL, Colorado (AP) _ The surgeon who operated on Italian soccer
player Alessandro Del Piero's knee says the surgery was a success
and the striker should be playing again within six to eight months.
	   ``The surgery was successful and we are expecting a good
recovery,'' Dr. Richard Steadman said Wednesday after the
two-and-a-half hour operation on ligaments in Del Piero's left
knee.
	   Steadman said a complete recovery is ``certainly our goal,'' but
that right now it is ``hard to see'' whether Del Piero will return
to 100 percent.
	   The Juventus and Italian national team striker will undergo
therapy for the next six months, he said.
	   The surgery was performed at the Steadman Hawkins clinic in
Vail. Steadman has treated major knee injuries of several
professional athletes, including Italian Serie A notables Nicola
Berti and Maurizio Ganz.
	   Del Piero will remain in the hospital for two to three days and
will stay in Vail for 10 days to two weeks, Steadman said.
	   Del Piero, 24, was injured in a league game against Udinese
three weeks ago. Before the surgery, Juventus doctors said he was
expected to be sidelined for the remainder of the Italian season,
which concludes in May.
	   One of the most popular Italian players and the European
Champions Cup leading scorer last season, Del Piero said in a
recent interview that he was prepared to face a long rehabilitation
``and be back to action, stronger than before, next season.''
	   Steadman and his clinic are world renown for their specialty in
sports-related injuries, having treated former German national team
captain Lothar Matthaeus, five-time overall Alpine World Cup
champion Marc Girardelli, four-time Australian Open champion Monica
Seles, two-time women's World Cup downhill champion Picabo Street
and several prominent American baseball, basketball and football
players.

Libya complains about not being invited to African summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With France-Africa Summit

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has protested
against being left out of the French-African summit that opened in
Paris Friday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The complaint was made in a letter Gadhafi sent to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who is attending the conference, MENA said
quoting Libya's ambassador to France, Ali Treki.
	   France said it could not invite Libya and Sudan because their
countries are under U.N. sanctions.
	   This explanation ``is not convincing,'' Gadhafi wrote in the
letter, MENA said quoting Treki.
	   Gadhafi said it is surprising that Libya was ignored even though
it was an African country. But he apparently stopped short of
blaming host France. Gadhafi and Mubarak have a good relationship
and Egypt has in the past supported Libya's participation in
international meetings.
	   ``This summit cannot discuss security in Africa without Libya
and Sudan's participation,'' Treki quoted Gadhafi's letter as
saying. MENA said Treki delivered the letter to Mubarak Friday.
	   Security is the focus of the two-day summit that has drawn 49
African nations, and 34 heads of state. It was opened by French
President Jacques Chirac.
	   Libya is under a U.N. flight ban, imposed in 1992 to try to
force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988
bombing of an American airliner of Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast
killed 270 people.
	   African countries decided in June to ignore the flight ban, and
several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad and
Sudan, have defied the sanctions by flying directly to Libya.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in the capital began a three-day
crackdown on firearms and explosives Friday to ensure the upcoming
13th Asian Games will be safe.
	   Special units will be on alert around the clock to search
crime-prone areas, entertainment venues and places reported by
informers, the organizing committee said.
	   Roadblocks will be set up throughout the city and random
inspections will be carried out in various areas, it said.
Pickpocket gangs will be a special target of the action.
	   The crackdown will be carried out from Friday through Sunday.
Youngsters have been warned to refrain from playing with
firecrackers during this period.
	   The games will run Dec. 6-20.

Kosovo guerrillas free two kidnapped Yugoslavia journalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two journalists from Serbia's
state-run Tanjug news agency, abducted last month by Kosovo's
rebels, were released Friday from a guerrilla stronghold in the
strife-torn province.
	   In the presence of chief international observer William Walker,
the ethnic Albanian rebels set free reporter Nebojsa Radosevic, 32,
and photographer Vladimir Dobricic, 50, in the guerrilla stronghold
of Dragobilje in central Kosovo.
	   The two were kidnapped Oct. 18 while on assignment in the area.
	   ``We were treated well from the beginning,'' Dobricic told
waiting reporters after three men wearing black uniforms of the
Kosovo Liberation Army escorted him to waiting international
observers. ``There was no physical harassment and now we just want
to go home.''
	   Walker, who heads the Kosovo observation mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, praised the
release.
	   ``This is obviously very good news for the detainees and their
families but I think it's also good news for Kosovo,'' Walker said.
``We in the OSCE see this as a small but very important gesture _ a
confidence-building measure we hope will be taken advantage of.''
	   The KLA said it had abducted the journalists after they drove
into rebel-held territory.
	   The abduction drew condemnation from human rights and media
watchdog organizations. The International Red Cross and other
organizations pleaded for their release.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila, the
center of attention at the 20th French-African summit, cannot be
pursued for human rights violations by French courts, the Paris
Prosecutor's office ruled Friday.
	   Kabila is one of 34 leaders attending the summit of 49 African
countries that focuses on security on their strife-ridden
continent.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the Congo and other
African countries to choose ``peace and compromise'' in resolving
crises.
	   ``Conflict in Africa is caused by human action and it can be
ended by human action,'' Annan said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac officially opened the summit,
which ends Saturday, with a call for African nations to do their
own peacekeeping -- an abrupt departure from past practices that
put the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   As the meeting got underway at the Louvre Museum's convention
space, French prosecutors rejected efforts by human rights groups
to charge Kabila, saying the Congolese leader benefits from the
customary immunity accorded to exercising heads of state.
	   The French Human Rights League and the International Federation
of Human Rights Leagues -- spurred by the decision of the House of
Lords rejecting immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet -- filed complaints this week against Kabila.
	   All eyes were on Kabila, who crosses paths here with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader.
Both Rwanda and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency in the
Congo.
	   That strides could be made behind the summit scenes in resolving
the Congo crisis was a quiet hope.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
Friday he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo ``during
the month of December.''
	   And the Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared to meet
with Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila held out little hope that progress could be made at
the summit, saying a pullout of Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces
from the Congo was a precondition for substantive talks on a peace
settlement.
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France
Internationale, Kabila added that his allies, Angola and Zimbabwe,
``were not pushing (him) to negotiate.''
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks with Chirac on Saturday.
	   Chirac stressed the need for Africans to take responsibility for
settling conflicts.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of
responsibility for Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.
	   ``The reality at the end of 1998 is that a quarter of
sub-Saharan African states are in crisis,'' he said, ``in most
cases, spilling over national borders.''
	   The French president called on African nations to move forward
with a ``collective architecture of security'' with regional and
sub-regional structures assuring the lion's share of the job.
	   He added that this would not imply an ``erosion of
responsibilities'' by the United Nations or the international
community.
	   Organization of African Unity chairman Blaise Campaore of
Burkina Faso agreed that Africans must take responsibility for
their own security.
	   But the international community ``has the duty of supporting
African peace initiatives,'' as well as providing technical,
logistical and financial support, Campaore said.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Four days before a huge military
parade dedicated to Romania's national day, police engineers
defused a bomb Friday that had been placed along the parade route.
	   '' This is an unprecedented, dangerous event,'' said Gen.
Nicolae Berechet, the head of Romanian police.
	   The bomb, which had a detonating device, was found early Friday
under a bridge by two passers-by. Police did not say whether the
device was set to go off at a certain time.
	   The bomb was found in the neighborhood of the House of the
People, a giant palace built by former dictator Nicoale Ceausescu.
The building now houses Parliament and is surrounded by several
ministries.
	   The military parade was scheduled to cross the bridge heading
toward the square in front of the palace.
	   An army spokesman said the bomb could have been intended to
sabotage the country's efforts to join NATO.
	   ``When we decided to enter the alliance we knew it would not be
easy and we would have sabotage attempts,'' Alexandru Stoenscu told
the private news agency Mediafax.
	   Police spokesmen did not release any details on the kind and the
strength of the explosives contained in the bomb. They also did not
say who might have planted the bomb.
	   A special commission comprised of police and Romanian
Intelligence Service officers was set up to investigate the
incident and scour the area near the bridge, police said.
	   On Tuesday, Romanians will mark 80 years since the country was
reunited with the region of Transylvania, which had been under the
rule of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   While the reformist ruling coalition will attend anniversary
ceremonies in the capital, the nationalist opposition sharply
criticized the location of the ceremonies.
	   They prefer that the day be celebrated in the Transylvanian city
of Alba Iulia, where reunification ceremonies took place in 1918.

EU blocks German government aid to oil company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators Friday
blocked a 47 million mark (dlrs 27.6 million) government rescue
package for two oil companies in eastern Germany.
	   The subsidies to Addinol Mineraloel GmbH and Addinol Lube Oil
GmbH and Co. KG violate EU laws by threatening to distort fair
competition, the European Commission said.
	   ``The German government shall take the necessary measures to
recover the aid,'' said a statement from the EU's executive body.
	   The Commission said the aid would not secure the long-term
viability of Addinol Lube which is based in the Saxony-Anhalt
region of the former East Germany.
	   The government's rescue plan was ``much too optimistic'' the
Commission statement said.
	   Addinol Mineraloel was privatized in 1994 after the break up of
an East German state company. It filed bankruptcy proceedings in
1997 and Addinol Lube was set up as a separate company blending and
selling lubricating oils.
	   The Commission ruled a separate aid package of 22 million marks
(dlrs 13 million) for Addinol Mineraloel was compatible with EU
laws.
	   Separately, the Commission cleared a 1 billion mark (dlrs 588
million) aid package to InfraLeuna Infrastrucktur und Service GmbH
to help privatize and clear up the giant Leuna chemical site near
the city of Leipzig in Saxony-Anhalt.
	   As a condition, the Commission said the German government had to
ensure the aid measures ``do not convey profits to any of the
parties involved.''

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu quotes; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
promised a thorough review of Israel's policy in Lebanon, saying he
cut short a trip to Europe and returned home to ``make decisions.''
	   However, Netanyahu also said he would only pull Israeli troops
out of southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to
attacks by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   With Hezbollah unwilling to give such guarantees, it is unlikely
Israeli troops will redeploy any time soon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in Hezbollah ambushes in
the past 10 days, and after the latest deaths on Thursday,
Netanyahu decided to return home, skipping a visit to Spain.
	   A review of Lebanon policy, with Cabinet ministers and army
generals attending, was set for Sunday.
	   Netanyahu proposed in the past that Israel and Lebanon negotiate
an arrangement _ something short of a full-fledged peace accord _
under which Israeli troops would gradually leave Lebanon. In
exchange, the Lebanese government would take up positions in the
south and disarm Hezbollah.
	   Lebanon has repeatedly rejected the idea, saying that U.N.
Resolution 425 requires Israel to leave without conditions.
	   However, Netanyahu apparently has not given up on the idea.
	   ``The government of Lebanon, of course, has the ability to
spread out to the south and take the necessary actions,'' Netanyahu
said after his return from Britain on Friday.
	   Netanyahu said Syria and Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, were
barring Lebanon from making such an arrangement with Israel.
	   ``All this is known, but it doesn't absolve Lebanon of direct
responsibilty for what happens in its territory,'' he said.
	   Despite the dilemmas Israel is facing, Netanyahu signaled that
he would take action. ``I came to make decisions,'' he said.
	   In all, 23 Israelis have died in Lebanon this year.
	   Hezbollah, using tactics like ambushes and roadside bombs, wants
to drive Israel out of the so-called security zone Israel
established in south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   Since 1985, Israel's policy has been based on the belief that it
can only pull out its troops as part of a peace agreement with
Lebanon. However, Syria, the main power in Lebanon, is unlikely to
permit such talks until Israel withdraws from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Netanyahu is unwilling to hand back the Golan, thus making a
peace agreement with Syria or Lebanon in the near future unlikely.
	   In recent months, there have been various proposals for a
unilateral Israeli troop withdrawal, including one by Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot quoted Netanyahu as saying in
London that he did not reject out of hand Sharon's plan under which
Israel would withdraw gradually and strike at Hezbollah ``by all
means'' should there be an attack on northern Israel.
	   However, upon his return home Netanyahu appeared to be sticking
closer to Israel's long-standing policy. ``As long as we don't have
an alternative, we'll stay in Lebanon in order to defend northern
Israel,'' he said.
	   Still, the rising casualty rate is increasing Israeli popular
pressure to end Israel's occupation of south Lebanon.
	   A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated that
40 percent of Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal, compared to
only 16 percent in February 1997. The survey was conducted among
560 adults and had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.
	   A signed front-page commentary in Yediot Ahronot called on
Netanyahu to ``take an initiative,'' cut through the tangle of
Israel's involvement in Lebanon and order a pullout.

Rugova says talks on Kosovo not far off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two Yugoslav journalists freed by KLA, envoys
exchange lists of missing &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, as
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, in a step hailed by a Western official as a ``small
but very important gesture,'' ethnic Albanian rebels freed two
journalists from the Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted
Oct. 18. Western diplomats helped negotiate the two men's release.
	   Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and European
envoys for Kosovo, met in the capital Pristina to discuss the
international initiative in Kosovo. They also exchanged lists of
Serbs and Albanians gone missing in the province since the outbreak
of clashes.
	   Hill has been trying to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to
both Serbs and Albanians, but so far his ideas have been rejected
by Serbia and only cautiously supported by ethnic Albanian
politicians.
	   The two sides' positions over Kosovo are still far apart. Serbia
wants to keep the province, which it considers the cradle of its
statehood, firmly under its control. The majority ethnic Albanians
want independence.
	   But Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the Albanians' independence
movement, said at a news conference in Pristina, that ``we are not
far from political negotiations.''
	   Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some progress in
U.S.-led efforts to bring the two sides closer together. There are
fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh fighting by spring if those
efforts fail.
	   Rugova said talks ``should be well-prepared.'' He dismissed
attempts by Serbia to organize talks without international
involvement as ``a well-known show.'' Rugova said Hill supported
his stand.
	   Serbian officials earlier this week tried to push forward their
own peace plan which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia with a
form of self-rule.
	   Hill has discussed his plan with ethnic Albanian rebels, whose
support is crucial. Ethnic Albanian sources have said that Kosovo
Liberation Army representatives would present Hill soon with their
written remarks on the draft.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   In the presence of chief international observer William Walker,
the rebels on Friday set free two Tanjug journalists _ reporter
Nebojsa Radosevic, 32, and photographer Vladimir Dobricic, 50 _ in
the guerrilla stronghold of Dragobilje in central Kosovo.
	   Walker, who heads the Kosovo observation mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, praised the
release.
	   ``This is obviously very good news for the detainees and their
families but I think it's also good news for Kosovo,'' Walker said.
``We in the OSCE see this as a small but very important gesture _ a
confidence-building measure we hope will be taken advantage of.''
	   The KLA said it had abducted the journalists after they drove
into rebel-held territory.

World Food Program truck convoy attacked in Angola, two killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen ambushed a column of trucks
carrying United Nations food aid in southwestern Angola, killing
two Angolans and wounding another, the World Food Program said
Friday.
	   The attacked highlighted growing insecurity in Angola, where a
1994 peace accord between the government and the former rebel group
UNITA is unraveling amid increased clashes between the former foes.
	   The 30-vehicle convoy was carrying 400 tons of food near
Lubango, a city about 600 kilometers (360 miles) south of the
capital Luanda, on Thursday when unidentified gunmen opened fire,
the WFP said in a statement.
	   Namibian troops deployed with the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Angola were escorting the convoy and returned fire, forcing the
attackers to flee.
	   The convoy, which was carrying enough food to feed 14,000 people
for about two months, turned back to Lubango.
	   Another WFP convoy, which was heading to the coastal city of
Lobito, has not been able to leave Huambo, 500 kilometers (300
miles) south of Luanda, for the past 10 days because authorities
closed the road for security reasons.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Despite pressure from Italy, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Friday that Germany will not extradite rebel Kurdish
leader Abdullah Ocalan on terror charges.
	   Schroeder said he asked Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema for his
understanding for the German position during their meeting Friday.
Germany is concerned that extraditing Ocalan would stir unrest
among Germany's 2 million Turks _ about one-quarter of them Kurds.
	   As the politicians spoke in Bonn, thousands of Turkish Kurds
began gathering there for a rally supporting Ocalan, the leader of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a
14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The conflict has killed
37,000 people.
	   Police expected 30,000 protesters on Friday, and Kurdish groups
have announced protests for Saturday in several cities around
Germany.

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Hundreds of grieving relatives have
converged on the town of Khanna to find survivors or identify
victims of one of the worst Indian train accident in recent times,
but only 93 of the 192 bodies recovered by Friday have been
identified.
	   Most of the rest remained unclaimed, said S.P. Mehta, a general
manager of Indian Railways. Mehta said the final toll in Thursday's
collision could well surpass 200.
	   ``Many of the bodies are badly mutilated. We may never be able
to identify them,'' said A. K. Kapoor, a top official of the
government-owned railroad company who was supervising the rescue
operations.
	   Nearly 1,500 people have come from distant villages and cities
to see if their loved ones are here. Slowly, some of them moved
from one white bundle to another, gingerly lifting the sheets,
looking for a recognizable face, a familiar piece of clothing or
jewelry. Most were disappointed.
	   Relatives sobbed uncontrollably as they peeked under one shroud
after another at the local college playground, converted into a
makeshift mortuary. Bodies were laid out on slabs of ice to slow
deterioration.
	   Unclaimed corpses were expected to be cremated by the
authorities Saturday.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
come uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi and
toppled into the path of the oncoming train on parallel tracks in
pre-dawn mist Thursday.
	   Nearly 2,500 workers using giant cranes untangled piled up train
carriages to extricate the bodies. Rescuers covered their faces as
the stench of rotting flesh hung in the air.
	   No survivors have been found since midday Thursday. Officials
said 260 people were injured and about 30 were in critical
condition in four hospitals. Teams of doctors operated all night,
amputating the legs or hands of some of the victims.
	   Work speeded up after the arrival of the huge crane that could
lift an entire train car. The workers, including nearly 200
soldiers, supported the wobbly wreckage with planks of wood and
steel beams. Others used acetylene torches or crowbars.
	   The workers cleared and opened one of the two railroad tracks
after a 46-hour disruption of traffic on the busy sector, said
Mehta, speaking at the wheat-trading town of Khanna, 250 kilometers
(150 miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   The second parallel track was likely to be cleared later Friday,
Mehta said.
	   India records around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the
largest rail network under one management in the world. Most are
blamed on human error or outdated equipment.
	   Friday's newspapers said safety recommendations are often
ignored in the rush to expand the network, often to please voters.
The government-owned railroad company has added 500 trains in the
last four years.
	   The worst accident was three years ago, when two trains collided
near New Delhi, killing 358 people.
	   The Indian Express newspaper said a flashing light on the engine
and last coach of the train _ a recommendation of numerous safety
committees _ might have prevented the accident. The government has
said it has little money for better equipment.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, as
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, in a step hailed by a Western official as a ``small
but very important gesture,'' ethnic Albanian rebels freed two
journalists from the Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted
Oct. 18. Western diplomats helped negotiate the two men's release.
	   Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and European
envoys for Kosovo, met in the capital Pristina to discuss the

World Food Program truck convoy attacked in Angola, two killed

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen ambushed a column of trucks
carrying U.N. food aid in southwestern Angola, killing two Angolans
and wounding another, the World Food Program said Friday.
	   The attacked highlighted growing insecurity in Angola, where a
1994 peace accord between the government and the former rebel group
UNITA is unraveling amid increased clashes.
	   The 30-vehicle convoy was carrying 400 tons of food near
Lubango, a city about 600 kilometers (360 miles) south of the
capital, Luanda, on Thursday when unidentified gunmen opened fire,
the WFP said in a statement.
	   Namibian troops deployed with the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Angola were escorting the convoy and returned fire, forcing the
attackers to flee.
	   The convoy, which was carrying enough food to feed 14,000 people
for about two months, turned back to Lubango.
	   Another WFP convoy, which was heading to the coastal city of
Lobito, has not been able to leave Huambo, 500 kilometers (300
miles) south of Luanda, for the past 10 days because authorities
closed the road for safety reasons.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A magistrate on Friday gave the government more
time to decide whether to go ahead with extradition proceedings for
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, or let the former Chilean leader go home.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw won an extra week, until Dec. 11, to
reach a decision.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson said
he would expect Pinochet to appear in court on that date, ``subject
to any medical reports.''
	   Pinochet, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year
regime, remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he
is recovering from back surgery earlier this month.
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that
Pinochet could not claim immunity as a former head of state.

Libya complains about not being invited to African summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-France-Africa Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has protested
being left out of the French-African summit that opened in Paris on
Friday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The complaint was made in a letter Gadhafi sent to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who is attending the conference, MENA
said, quoting Libya's ambassador to France, Ali Treki.
	   Gadhafi and Mubarak have a good relationship and Egypt has in
the past supported Libya's participation in international meetings.
	   France said it could not invite Libya and Sudan because their
countries are under U.N. sanctions.
	   This explanation ``is not convincing,'' Gadhafi wrote in the
letter, MENA said.
	   Gadhafi said it is surprising that Libya was ignored, but
apparently stopped short of blaming France.
	   ``This summit cannot discuss security in Africa without Libya
and Sudan's participation,'' Treki quoted Gadhafi's letter as
saying. MENA said Treki delivered the letter to Mubarak on Friday.
	   Security is the focus of the two-day summit that has drawn
representatives from 49 African nations, and 34 heads of state. It
was opened by French President Jacques Chirac.
	   Libya is under a U.N. flight ban imposed in 1992 to try to force
Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988
bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast
killed 270 people.
	   African countries decided in June to ignore the flight ban, and
several African leaders, including the heads of Congo, Chad and
Sudan, have defied the sanctions by flying directly to Libya.

Ukraine's central bank critical of plans to loosen monetary
</HEADLINE>
policies &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank warned Friday that
the economy and the currency will collapse if the government sticks
to its plans to allow the hryvna to float freely and to raise the
projected inflation rate for 1999.
	   ``I'm afraid even to speak of what (the floating rate) could
lead to,'' Serhiy Yaremenko, chief of the National Bank's currency
control department, told the independent Ukrainian News agency.
	   ``It will cause the currency to devalue, trigger inflation and
ruin the economy,'' Yaremenko said.
	   Last week, President Leonid Kuchma spoke in favor of a floating
rate for the hryvna _ instead of the existing trading band that
limits broad fluctuations in the currency _ and for printing more
money to let the cash-poor government ease its mounting debt
burden.
	   Ukraine lacks several hundred million dollars to keep the 1998
budget deficit at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, a primary
requirement set by the International Monetary Fund for the
disbursement of a recently approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   However, the Cabinet's chronically lax tax collection and
failure to implement reforms needed to boost economic activity have
led government leaders to suggest printing money and allowing
higher inflation to avoid a deeper crisis.
	   On Wednesday, Kuchma said the inflation figure for 1999 should
be about 20 percent _ instead of the projected 7.8 percent _ and
said the Cabinet should either readjust or abandon the trading
band.
	   However, National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said Friday
the 1999 inflation target was still ``under discussion,'' and
warned that the current stability at the financial market was too
fragile to permit the looser monetary policies the government was
proposing.
	   ``We do not see any indicators of a possible deterioration, but
neither do we see any signals of improvement,'' Yushchenko told a
news conference.
	   The National Bank has stabilized the currency market in recent
weeks, maintaining the hryvna rate at around 3.43 to the U.S.
dollar, within a trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The stabilization followed two months of financial turmoil in
Ukraine caused by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   Yushchenko added that the financial situation in Russia, Belarus
and Moldova _ Ukraine's major trade partners _ continued to worsen,
which demands careful monetary policies from Ukraine.
	   ``The situation is such that we cannot let ourselves act
recklessly,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with European Union reaction

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Hundreds of trucks and heavy
equipment blocked traffic in smaller towns and villages Friday
across the Czech Republic in a protest against imports of cheap
pork from European Union countries.
	   The protest, scheduled to last two hours, was aimed at ``forcing
the government to better protect its farmers,'' Drahomir Tobias of
the Czech Agriculture Chamber told the public Czech Radio.
	   ``Prices of a number of commodities have already dropped sharply
due to the subsidized imports from abroad,'' Tobias said.
	   Farmers claim the Czech market has been flooded with cheap pork
products from abroad and most Czech pork producers will go bankrupt
if the state doesn't intervene.
	   The government Wednesday raised duties on certain pork products
from 15 percent to 40 percent, but farmers said it isn't enough.
	   ``The protests are aimed against the methods of the EU and
against importers of cheap pork,'' the chairman of the Agriculture
Chamber, Vaclav Hlavacek, said.
	   The European Commission on Friday said the government's decision
to increase the duties on pork was ``regrettable.''
	   ``We haven't been notified that they've taken any such
measures,'' the commission's spokesman, Gerard Kiely, told
journalists in Brussels, adding that the issue will be raised
Monday at a meeting between EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler and Czech Agriculture Minister Jan Fencl.
	   The Czech Republic has witnessed a sharp increase in pork
imports in the past two months as EU countries have lost their
Russian markets.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Excerpts from the anti-doping
agreement between the International Olympic Committee and
international federations approved Friday:
	   _ 1. ``The principle of the fight against doping ... must be
incorporated into a single Medical Code adopted by all the
organizations belonging to the Olympic Movement; they shall include
a definition of doping, and must lead to exemplary sanctions for
athletes and their entourage.
	   ``The definition of doping shall be essentially based on the
ascertainment of the presence or the use of prohibited substances
or methods ... if there is use of substances or methods potentially
harmful to the health of athletes and/or capable of enhancing their
sports performances.
	   ``Cases of refusal to submit to the prescribed controls,
complicity or other forms of participation in ... doping offenses,
repeat offenses, trafficking of prohibited substances and
interference in the conduct of the prescribed controls shall also
be addressed.''
	   _ 2. ``... all participants consider that, for a first offense,
the minimum sanction for major doping substances or prohibited
methods shall be a two-year suspension.
	   ``In the case of a repeat offense, the sanction shall be life
suspension.
	   ``In all cases, there will be the possibility of applying
additional sanctions or measures, such as financial penalties, ...
periodic or unannounced testing of the athlete in question, or
other forms of testing.''
	   _ 3. ``... an independent ... anti-doping agency for the entire
Olympic Movement, will be created.
	   ``This institution, under the presidency of the IOC President
... will have as its mandate, notably, to coordinate the various
programs necessary to realize its objectives that shall be defined
jointly by all parties concerned.
	   ``... consideration should be given in particular to expanding
out-of-competition testing, coordinationg research, promoting
preventive and educational actions, and harmonizing scientific and
technical standards and procedures for analyses and equipment.''
	   _ 4, ``... a new model for effective cooperation between
government authorities and sports organizations must be developed.
	   ``The harmonization of legislation on doping in sport is
indispensible at international level.''
	   _ 5. ``It is esential to lend particular attention to
prevention. It is therefore important to intensify and coordinate
doping prevention policies, particularly in the form of education
and information campaigns.''
	   _ 6. ``At international level, the IOC and the International
Federations will maintain their respective authority and
responsibility to apply doping rules in accordance with their own
procedures.
	   ``... decisions handed down at first instance, including
evaluation of results, hearing procedures, decisions regarding
sanctions and their application to athletes, will be under the
exclusive responsibility of the International Federations or,
during the Olympic Games, the IOC.
	   ``With regard to last instance appeals, the IOC and
International Federations recognize the authority of the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS), after their own procedures have been
exhausted.''
	   _ 7. ``The sports included on the Program of the Olympic Games
must be governed by International Federations which agree to comply
with the above-mentioned principles and provisions.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Courtney Walsh broke the West
Indies all-time test wicket record Friday, taking three on the
second day in the first test against South Africa to surpass
Malcolm Marshal at the Wanderers Stadium.
	   His success left South Africa at 138 for three at tea, chasing
the West Indies first innings score of 261.
	   When he had opener Adam Bacher caught behind for one, he equaled
Marshall's record of 375. After lunch in his second spell, he
removed Jacques Kallis for 53 and Darryl Cullinan for eight to
claim the record outright.
	   He acknowleged the mark by saluting Marshall, who was watching
from the West Indies dressing room.
	   At the crease at tea were Gary Kirsten on 57 and Hansie Cronje
on six.
	   Earlier in the day, South Africa quickly removed the West Indies
tail, as the visitors resumed at 249 for seven. Shaun Pollock took
two more wickets for only three runs and Allan Donald added the
other as South Africa finished off the West Indies for only 12.
	   Pollock finished with five for 54.
	   In South Africa's reply, Bacher fell after South Africa had put
up only 10, another disappointing opening partnership for the host.
	   The last reasonable start to an innings for South Africa came in
March this year, against Sri Lanka, when Gary Kirsten and Gerhardus
Liebenberg put on 89.

Tamil rebel commander says he is willing to talk peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ In a sharp change of tone, the
commander of the Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka said Friday he is ready
for peace talks to end the 15-year war, but would not give up the
Tamil demand for ``our own soil.''
	   ``We have not closed the door for peace. We are open to the
civilized method of resolving conflict through rational dialogue,''
said Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, in a statement faxed to news organizations.
	   Prabhakaran said he preferred third-party mediation, and would
not accept conditions. In the past, the government has demanded the
Tigers relinquish some weapons before talks could begin.
	   ``We aspire to live in peace fully with freedom and dignity,
without the interference of anyone, in our own soil in our
motherland, where we were born and bred,'' he said. ``We, too, are
human beings.''
	   The statement was to have been broadcast on the clandestine
Voice of Tigers radio, but the signal was apparently jammed and
could not be heard in government-held territory.
	   The moderate tone of what has become Prabhakaran's annual
address was markedly milder than last year, when he told his
followers that liberation is not a gift, but is ``achieved by
shedding blood and through hard struggle.''
	   There was no immediate reaction from the government.
	   President Chandrika Kumaratunga has proposed constitutional
changes to give more powers to local councils, including one
governing a predominately Tamil area in Sri Lanka's north and east.
	   But the rebels demand a separate homeland, accusing the
Sinhalese majority of systematic oppression of the Tamils. Tamils
comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million people and have a
language, religion and culture distinct from that of the Sinhalese.
	   The government has treated previous peaceful signals from the
Tigers with skepticism since the rebels abruptly ended a
three-month cease-fire and broke off peace talks in 1995.
	   But analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu called the speech
``healthy and encouraging,'' and said the government should respond
positively if Prabhakaran is judged to be sincere.
	   ``The issue here is, how to get it going. Who is going to start
the process,'' Saravanamuttu, of the independent Center for Policy
Alternative, told The Associated Press.
	   The speech marks the end of Hero's Week, commemorating rebel
casualties. About 57,000 people have been killed since the ethnic
conflict between the minority Tamils and the majority Sinhalese
erupted into war in 1983.
	   Prabhakaran founded the Tigers in 1976 and commands the
organization alone and unchallenged.
	   In recent weeks, both sides have shown signs of fatigue
following a ferocious battle in September for the towns of
Kilinochchi and Mankulam. The towns lie on the vital north-south
highway through rebel territory linking government-controlled
territory to the Jaffna Peninsula. The government said 535 soldiers
and 620 rebels were killed, but the casualties were believed to be
far higher.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu quotes; EDITS to TRIM. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
promised a thorough review of Israel's policy in Lebanon, saying he
cut short a trip to Europe and returned home to ``make decisions.''
	   However, Netanyahu also said he would only pull Israeli troops
out of southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to
attacks by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   With Hezbollah unwilling to give such guarantees, it is that
unlikely Israeli troops will redeploy any time soon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in Hezbollah ambushes in
the past 10 days, and after the latest deaths on Thursday,
Netanyahu decided to return home, skipping a visit to Spain.
	   A review of Lebanon policy, with Cabinet ministers and army
generals attending, was set for Sunday.
	   Hezbollah, using tactics like ambushes and roadside bombs, wants
to drive Israel out of the so-called security zone Israel
established in south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent cross-border
guerrilla attacks on northern Israel.
	   Netanyahu has proposed in the past that Israel and Lebanon
negotiate an arrangement _ something short of a full-fledged peace
accord _ under which Israeli troops would gradually leave Lebanon.
In exchange, the Lebanese government would take up positions in the
south and disarm Hezbollah.
	   Lebanon has repeatedly rejected the idea, saying that U.N.
Resolution 425 requires Israel to leave without conditions.
	   However, Netanyahu apparently has not given up on the idea.
	   ``The government of Lebanon, of course, has the ability to
spread out to the south and take the necessary actions,'' Netanyahu
said after his return from Britain on Friday.
	   Netanyahu said Syria and Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, were
barring Lebanon from making such an arrangement with Israel.
	   ``All this is known, but it doesn't absolve Lebanon of direct
responsibility for what happens in its territory,'' he said.
	   Despite the dilemmas Israel is facing, Netanyahu signaled that
he would take action. ``I came to make decisions,'' he said.
	   In all, 23 Israelis have died in Lebanon this year.
	   Since 1985, Israel's policy has been based on the belief that it
can only pull its troops out as part of a peace agreement with
Lebanon. However, Syria, the main power in Lebanon, is unlikely to
permit such talks until Israel withdraws from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Netanyahu is unwilling to hand back the Golan, thus making a
peace agreement with Syria or Lebanon in the near future unlikely.
	   In recent months, there have been various proposals for a
unilateral Israeli troop withdrawal, including one by Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot quoted Netanyahu as saying in
London that he did not reject out-of-hand Sharon's plan, under
which Israel would withdraw gradually and strike at Hezbollah ``by
all means'' should there be an attack on northern Israel.
	   However, upon his return home Netanyahu appeared to be sticking
closer to Israel's long-standing policy. ``As long as we don't have
an alternative, we'll stay in Lebanon in order to defend northern
Israel,'' he said.
	   Still, the rising casualty rate is increasing Israeli popular
pressure to end Israel's occupation of south Lebanon.
	   A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated that
40 percent of Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal, compared to
only 16 percent in February 1997. The survey was conducted among
560 adults and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent.
	   A signed front-page commentary in Yediot Ahronot called on
Netanyahu to ``take an initiative,'' cut through the tangle of
Israel's involvement in Lebanon and order a pullout.

	   The Chilean Embassy filed written arguments on Thursday with
British authorities.
	   Pinochet is receiving psychiatric care for stress-related
disorders, which his lawyers might cite in a bid to have the former
Chilean dictator found mentally unfit to stand trial, The Times
reported in Friday's editions.
	   ``He is undergoing assessment for stress and stress-related
disorders,'' The Times newspaper quoted an unidentified ``highly
placed medical source'' as saying. ``It is well documented that
elderly people frequently react badly to stress.''
	   Straw has wide discretion to decide whether to follow the House
of Lords ruling and send the Spanish extradition request through
the courts _ or to allow Pinochet to go home.
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
Allende died in the coup.

Moss carries Vikings past Cowboys 46-36
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Randy Moss can add the Dallas Cowboys to his
personal triumph list.
	   The Minnesota rookie receiver turned his three catches into a
51-yard touchdown and twin 56-yard scores to lead the Vikings to a
46-36 victory over Dallas on Thursday. He also drew a 50-yard pass
interference penalty that set up another score.
	   ``Randy only made three catches,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green
said, ``but he made big plays with each of them.''
	   Another Minnesota (11-1) victory or a Green Bay loss would wrap
up the NFC Central division title for the Vikings. They're already
the favorite to gain the home-field advantage throughout the U.S.
National Football League playoffs; their next two opponents have
losing records and their toughest remaining game is at home against
Jacksonville.
	   The Cowboys (8-4) had a four-game winning streak snapped despite
getting a career-high 455 yards from quarterback Troy Aikman.
	   In Thursday's other game, Detroit beat Pittsburgh 19-16 in
overtime.
 &UR; Lions 19, Steelers 16, OT &QC; 
	   At Pontiac, Michigan, in a game marked by a bizarre coin flip to
start overtime, Detroit escaped on a 42-yard field goal by Jason
Hanson 2:52 into the extra period.
	   On the coin flip, Jerome Bettis of Pittsburgh (7-5) called
tails. But referee Phil Luckett claimed Bettis called
``heads-tails'' and Luckett went with the first thing he heard.
	   ``That is a lie. That's a bald-faced lie,'' Bettis said.
	   After a 21-yard runback by Terry Fair, the Lions (5-7) went 41
yards in seven plays, keyed by a 28-yard pass from Charlie Batch to
Herman Moore and a face-mask call against Chris Oldham.
	   Batch finished 16-of-23 for 236 yards with a 21-yard TD pass to
Moore. Barry Sanders gained 33 yards on 20 carries but still became
just the second back in NFL history to rush for more than 15,000
yards.

Springboks aim to beat Ireland and tie All Blacks streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa aims to tie New Zealand's record of
17 test victories in a row when it faces Ireland Saturday and only
a major upset will halt the Springboks' streak.
	   A struggle against Wales was followed by a comfortable five-try
flourish against Scotland last week and now the South Africans face
probably the weakest of the Five Nations at Lansdowne Road.
	   The Springboks last loss was a 55-35 defeat by the All Blacks in
Auckland in August of last year. Since then they have beaten
Australia three times, New Zealand, France, Wales, England, Ireland
and Scotland twice, and Italy once. A victory over Ireland Saturday
and England at Twickenham next week would beat the All Blacks
record and two more wins over Italy early next season would then
take the mark to 20.
	   The game in Dublin is one of three international matches on
Saturday. England fears a heavy loss to Australia in a test at
Twickenham and Scotland expects a high-scoring victory over
Portugal in a World Cup qualifying game at Murrayfield.
	   South African coach Nick Mallett has named the same starting 15
that beat the Scots 35-10 at Murrayfield and hopes that the
fast-moving, tough tacking back row of Johan Erasmus, Bobby
Skinstad and team captain Gary Teichmann will dominate the Irish at
Lansdowne Road.
	   Fly half Henry Honiball and wings Stefan Terblanche and Pieter
Roussow also are in standout form and face an Irish team which has
six changes from the lineup that beat Romania in a World Cup
qualifying game last weekend.
	   Keith Wood returns at hooker and the Irish have made three
changes behind the scrum, with Kevin Maggs recalled at center,
Girvan Dempsey on the left wing and Conor McGuinness at scrum half.
	   It all points to a high-scoring win for the visitor.
	   That's just what England is dreading at Twickenham, especially
after last weekend's appalling performance against Italy.
	   The English were leading 16-15 and were being outplayed by the
underdog Italians at Huddersfield in a World Cup qualifying game
when center Will Greenwood relieved the tension with a solo try
near the end for a 23-15 win.
	   Although team captain Lawrence Dallaglio returns to reinforce a
pack that performed badly, Greenwood is missing from the lineup
against the Australians because of groin injury and will be
replaced by former captain Phil de Glanville.
	   ``Will and I are obviously disappointed but I have no hesitation
in bringing Phil into the starting lineup,'' said coach Clive
Woodward. ``He is a player of proven quality at international
level.''
	   Woodward has also recalled experienced winger Tony Underwood and
made three changes in a powerful pack. Whether they are capable of
outshoving a well-organized Australian eight, which includes huge
lockforwards John Eales and 6-foot-8 (2.03 meter), 266-pound (120.6
kg) Tom Bowman, remains to be seen.
	   The Australians have enough talent and power to beat the English
even at their best and will also be helped by the home team
questioning its ability to win the big games.
	   ``We must be the easiest team in the world to defend against,''
said England's assistant coach, John Mitchell, a former New Zealand
player.
	   ``I know that I would not spend too long in front of a video to
sort us out if I were an opponent. It is time we started
delivering. There has been too much talk, too many excuses and too
few results.''
	   Scotland shouldn't need such harsh words to motivate them
against comparative rugby minnow Portugal even though the
administrative structure appears to be in disarray. On Thursday
former stars John Jeffrey and Andy Irvine quit their high ranking
positions in protest at the way the Scottish Rugby Union is running
the sport in the country.
	   The Scots have put out a strong team against the Portuguese with
Gregor Townsend, normally a fly-half or center, making a rare
appearance at fullback.
	   The other team in the group is Spain who play Portugal on
Wednesday and then Scotland on Dec. 5. The top two teams from the
group qualify for next October's finals with the third going into a
playoff.

Dutch, Italian carriers sign long-term alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Italy's national carrier Alitalia SpA signed an agreement Friday
launching a long-term alliance including cargo and passenger joint
ventures.
	   The alliance, in which KLM and Alitalia are equal partners, aims
to strengthen both airlines' position in intercontinental and
European passenger and cargo routes.
	   At the alliance's official launch, KLM and Alitalia said they
don't intend to take equity positions in each other's company. The
joint ventures will be based on ``sharing of the greater part of
the revenues and costs of the carriers' route networks,'' the
airlines said in a statement.
	   KLM President Leo van Wijk said the passenger joint venture will
have an annual added value of dlrs 380 million, which it will start
generating in three years time, while the cargo one will have an
annual added value of dlrs 65 million.
	   The added value will be created in part by including increased
market share and new flights connecting Italy and the Netherlands,
Van Wijk said.
	   The joint ventures are expected to start sometime in 1999.
	   KLM, which also has a partnership deal with U.S. carrier
Northwest Airlines, said it can terminate the Alitalia alliance if
the Italian airline's privatization is not completed by June 30,
2000.

Court extend deadline for decision on Pinochet extradition until
</HEADLINE>
Dec. 11 &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: Combines urgent series, adds quote from magistrate; CORRECTS
name Insulza in graf 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A magistrate on Friday gave the government more
time to decide whether to go ahead with extradition proceedings for
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, or let the former Chilean leader go home.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw won an extra week, until Dec. 11, to
reach a decision.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson said
he would expect Pinochet to appear in court on that date, ``subject
to any medical reports.''
	   ``Obviously this is a decision which must be made and there must
be time given for proper consideration of all the representations.
It is in some respects quite a historic decision to make,''
Parkinson told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet.
	   Pinochet, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year
regime, remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he
is recovering from back surgery earlier this month.
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that
Pinochet could not claim immunity as a former head of state.
	   Chile's Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, whose government
has pressed for Pinochet's freedom, flew to London Friday to meet
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   ``I have explained to him and he understands this, that this is
a matter for the due legal process _ it's not a matter for
diplomatic negotiations,'' Cook told reporters before meeting his
Chilean counterpart.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Straw would be acting in
a quasi judicial role and would entirely responsible for the
decision.
	   ``He will not be seeking the views of Cabinet colleagues,'' said
a spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
prime minister does not expect to be consulted on this at all.''
	   The Chilean Embassy filed written arguments on Thursday with
British authorities.
	   Pinochet is receiving psychiatric care for stress-related
disorders, which his lawyers might cite in a bid to have the former
Chilean dictator found mentally unfit to stand trial, The Times
reported in Friday's editions.
	   ``He is undergoing assessment for stress and stress-related
disorders,'' The Times newspaper quoted an unidentified ``highly
placed medical source'' as saying. ``It is well documented that
elderly people frequently react badly to stress.''
	   Straw, whose department is responsible for justice issues, has
wide discretion to decide whether to follow the House of Lords
ruling and send the Spanish extradition request through the courts
_ or to allow Pinochet to go home.
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
Allende died in the coup.

Sailors go berserk after arguments at a cricket match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Some navy personnel attacked civilian
homes after an altercation with a cricketer at a match in the
southern port city of Galle, a state-run newspaper said Friday.
	   Eight civilians and three sailors were injured in Galle, 110
kilometers (65 miles) south of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, The
Observer said.
	   A Sri Lankan navy spokesman refused comment on the newspaper
report.
	   The Observer said the navy personnel attacked 75 homes in the
Pitiwella village near Galle town late Thursday after heated
arguments with a cricket player. Details were not known.
	   Hours after the match, the navy personnel, some of them in
uniform and armed, drove to the cricketer's village and went on a
rampage, the newspaper said.
	   They also stopped cars and other vehicles and beat up their
drivers, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Carlos Moya, the French Open champion,
defeated Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5 on Friday to reach the
semifinals of the ATP Tour World Championship.
	   Moya joined top-ranked Pete Sampras and Tim Henman in the last
four of the elite season-ending event and will face Henman on
Saturday.
	   In later matches, Henman played Greg Rusedski and Alex Corretja
battled Albert Costa. Corretja can clinch the last spot in the dlrs
3.5 million event if he beats Costa.
	   Sampras had a day off and an opportunity to savor his historic
achievement _ holding to the No. 1 ranking for the sixth
consecutive year.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras
said after breaking the record he held jointly with Jimmy Connors.
	   There are new milestones to achieve as well: Sampras is one
title short of the 12 Grand Slam tournaments won by Roy Emerson.
	   And there is the French Open on clay, the only one Sampras
hasn't won. ``That's the biggest challenge,'' he said.
	   Staying No. 1 for six consecutive years, Sampras said, required
a lot of hard work.
	   ``It was well worth the sacrifice,'' he said just before
champagne was poured over his head at a little ceremony. He
returned the favor, showering ATP Tour chief Mark Miles and
promoter Ion Tiriac.
	   There was also a cake representing the figure six, with a
chocolate tennis ball inside the circle.
	   ``It's an ultimate achievement, it will probably never be
broken,'' he said. ``I'm trying to stay humble through all this,
but the record speaks for itself. It's a little overwhelming.''
	   Sampras was assured of the record when Marcelo Rios of Chile,
the only player with a chance to overtake him, pulled out of the
ATP championship because of a back injury.
	   Rios trailed Sampras 33 points on the computer rankings.
	   Having won his first two round-robin matches, Sampras was
already assured a semifinal berth before he played Karol Kucera on
Thursday. A relaxed Sampras then demonstrated why he is No. 1,
crushing Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes.
	   Kucera is No. 7 and beat Sampras once in their three previous
matches this year.
	   If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the event in
1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   After Andre Agassi, Rios was the second player to pull out of
the tournament that nominally brings together the top eight players
of the year.

Rugova says talks on Kosovo not far off

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, and
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   Ibrahim Rugova said at a news conference in Pristina, the
capital of the Serbian province, that ``we are not far from
political negotiations.''
	   Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some progress in
U.S.-led efforts to bring the Serbs and ethnic Albanians closer
together. There are fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh
fighting by spring if those efforts fail.
	   Meanwhile, Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and
European envoys for Kosovo, met in Pristina.
	   Hill has been trying to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to
both sides, but so far his ideas have been rejected by Serbia and
only cautiously supported by ethnic Albanian politicians.
	   Serbia wants to keep the province, which it considers the cradle
of its state, firmly under its control. The majority ethnic
Albanians want independence. Serbia is, in turn, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown in
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others in the province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   Earlier in the week, Serbian officials tried to push forward
their own peace plan, which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia
with a form of self-rule.
	   On Friday, ethnic Albanian rebels freed two journalists from the
Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted Oct. 18. Western
diplomats helped negotiate the men's release.
	   Chief international observer William Walker, who heads the
Kosovo observation mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, praised the release.
	   ``We in the OSCE see this as a small but very important gesture
_ a confidence-building measure we hope will be taken advantage
of,'' Walker said.

Kenyan government clears Cabinet minister in political slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The government has exonerated a Cabinet
minister from responsibility for the killing of a foreign minister
eight years ago.
	   The 85-page report published Friday said Nicholas Biwott, a
confidant of President Daniel arap Moi, had nothing to do with the
slaying of Robert Ouko in 1990.
	   An investigation conducted by Scotland Yard at Moi's request
named Biwott, then industry minister, and Hezekiah Oyugi, who was
in charge of internal security, as prime suspects.
	   Biwott and Oyugi were the president's closest advisers when
Ouko's charred and mutilated body was found near his western Kenya
home in 1990. Ouko, who fought against government corruption, had
been shot once in the head.
	   Biwott is viewed as Kenya's second-most powerful man, and
currently is minister of regional cooperation. Biwott was released
from police custody in 1991 for a lack of evidence in the death of
Ouko. Oyugi died in 1992.
	   The two men also were implicated by witnesses who testified at a
commission of inquiry set up by the government in 1990 to
investigate the killing. The commission was, however, disbanded by
Moi before it finished its work.
	   Biwott and Oyugi allegedly wanted Ouko eliminated because of
differences including a dispute over government plans to revive a
stalled molasses factor in the western town of Kisumu.
	   Relatives maintain Ouko was slain as he was preparing a report
on high-level corruption, an issue over which the foreign minister
and Biwott had previously quarreled.
	   Industry Minister Francis Masakhalia said he issued the
statement on behalf of the government to end public speculation
about Ouko's killing.
	   It was not clear why the government waited eight years to
comment on the killing, for which no one was been punished.
	   A recent biography of Moi by British writer Andrew Morton blamed
the killing on Oyugi, raising the possibility that Ouko had an
affair with one of Oyugi's three wives.
	   The book was criticized by many Kenyans as a publicity stunt for
Moi, Kenya's ruler for more than two decades.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian prisoners calling hunger strike,
chief Muslim cleric in Jerusalem denying Israeli incitement
charges; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian security prisoners in two
Israeli jails have begun a hunger strike to press for their
release, the head of the prisoners' association said Friday.
	   Prisoners' relatives, meanwhile, said they would stage protest
marches Saturday in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement, Israel is to release 750
Palestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January.
	   However, most of those freed in the first stage last week were
criminals, prompting the Palestinians to complain that Israel had
violated the agreement. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had
expected all of those released to be activists of his Fatah
movement or those jailed for fighting Israeli occupation.
	   A week ago, three Fatah prisoners in Israel's Megiddo Prison
began a hunger strike, said Issa Karakeh, head of the Palestinian
Prisoners' Association. On Wednesday, 125 prisoners at Shata Prison
near the Israeli town of Beit Shean joined the fast, Karakeh said.
	   ``We received a letter that was smuggled out of Shata prison
late Thursday night informing us of the strike,'' Karakeh said.
	   The prisoners said in the note they hoped all other Palestinian
prisoners would join the hunger strike.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel.
	   Prisoner releases are an emotionally charged issue because
nearly every Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by
Israel at one time. Prisoner releases are seen as a true gauge of
whether peace agreements bring real benefits.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, Palestinians stoned
Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers after settlers blocked
Palestinian motorists from using a road near their enclave and then
marched into the Palestinian-run sector.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse the
stone-throwers and eventually escorted the group of about 20
settlers, most of them women, back into the Israeli-controlled
downtown area.
	   In Jerusalem, the chief Muslim cleric bristled at Israeli
charges that the sermons delivered in mosques in the West Bank,
Gaza and Jerusalem are often used to incite against Israel.
	   The mufti of Jerusalem, Ikrema Sabri, said in a sermon delivered
at Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, that ``as teachers
and scholars we will continue with our sermons and we will continue
with our religious duties.''
	   Friday sermons are broadcast live on the Voice of Palestine
radio station. Preachers often attack Israel for policies such as
land confiscations, home demolitions and settlement activities.
Preachers frequently call on Muslims to unite against infidels.
	   Last week, Israel and the Palestinians sat down to tackle the
issue of incitement in a committee established at the request of
Israel as part of last month's peace agreement.
	   The Palestinian Authority issued an anti-incitement decree, but
Israel said the decree was not enough.

Drug use growing in Romania; U.N. conference examines why

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ He used to play hockey. But since
Tudor Marinescu started doing heroin a few months back, he's quit
being left wing for a Bucharest club and can't hold his job down
any more.
	   ``Heroin destroys your health, your finances and your morale,''
said the 20-year-old barman who is one of a few young Romanians
seeking help for his addiction in the country's only drug treatment
clinic.
	   Marinescu is one of a growing number of drug addicts in this
former communist country _ thousands, although there are no
reliable estimates available. In the past two years the number of
people seeking treatment at the Gheorghe Marinescu hospital has
surged fivefold.
	   A United Nations-sponsored two-day conference began Friday in
Bucharest to shed light on what is an unknown and largely ignored
problem. However, prominent public figures including Romania's
first lady Nadia Constantinescu did not come, despite being
scheduled to attend.
	   ``(Politicians) are waiting for generations of Romanians to be
destroyed,'' said Dr. Christian Bellu-Bengescu, head of the drug
addiction department at the hospital. ``If one of their kids gets
hooked they'll take it seriously.''
	   Under communism which ended in 1989, drugs such as heroin and
marijuana were almost unheard of. In the past few years, Romania
has become a transit point on the Middle East to West Europe
smuggling route.
	   Druge are readily available in cities, where peer pressure and
free samples gets many teens addicted. Bellu-Bengescu said he's
mainly treating 17- and 18-year-olds, many lapsed addicts.
	   There is no government education, no videos and practically no
printed information available. Teachers attending the conference
said they desperately need information to combat a growing problem.
	   At the Gheorghe Marinescu hospital, the only treatment available
is for physical addictions. There are no day centers or medical
followup help.
	   ``You just can't give up drugs in Romania,'' said Claudiu
Seitan, 24 who's been using heroin for three years. ``We don't have
the conditions here.''

Germany submits bid to FIFA president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Less than a day after stepping up his
support for South Africa's bid to host the 2006 World Cup, FIFA
President Sepp Blatter said Friday that Germany was a ``very strong
candidate.''
	   Franz Beckenbauer, vice president of Germany's soccer
federation, handed over written confirmation of his country's
interest to Blatter at FIFA headquarters in Zurich.
	   England, Brazil, Egypt and Ghana have also officially informed
FIFA they want the finals.
	   Prospective candidates have until Dec. 31 to signal their intent
and until the end of next July to submit their full bid. FIFA's
24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   ``FIFA is very appreciative of the immense global interest being
shown in the staging of its most prestigious competition,
especially in Germany,'' Blatter said in a statement.
	   ``I am certain that the German FA (Football Association) will,
in customary fashion, prove to be a very strong candidate.''
	   But Blatter has long made it clear that he wants the finals to
be awarded to South Africa.
	   At a ceremony in Johannesburg on Thursday, he went further than
usual by declaring that FIFA had a ``responsibility'' to make sure
the tournament takes place in Africa.
	   ``I am fighting for the World Cup of 2006 to come to Africa,''
Blatter told reporters.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are both from the same continent. The 2002 finals
are being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA says this
is for the first and last time.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Russia's top
arms-trading official Friday and appointed a former KGB
intelligence officer as its new chief, the Kremlin said.
	   Yevgeny Ananyev, chief of the Rosvooruzheniye state arms-trading
monopoly since August 1997, had long been rumored to be on his way
out, blamed for a slump in Russia's weapons exports.
	   Yeltsin fired Ananyev and replaced him with Grigory Rapota, a
long-time aide to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, presidential
press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin told a news conference Friday.
	   According to the business daily Kommersant, Rapota, 54,
graduated from Moscow Bauman Technical University and in 1966
joined the KGB. During Soviet times, he worked as a KGB spy in the
United States and Finland, the newspaper said.
	   Primakov, who in 1991-1996 headed Russia's Foreign Intelligence
Service, a KGB successor agency, appointed Rapota his deputy in
1993. Earlier this year, Rapota was appointed deputy secretary of
the presidential security council, where he was in charge of
monitoring nuclear and missile non-proliferation.
	   Rapota's wife, Tatyana Samolis, served as a spokeswoman for
Primakov when he worked as intelligence chief and now is
spokeswoman for Primakov's successor, Gen. Vyacheslav Trubnikov.
	   Kommersant said Rapota's former colleagues extolled him as an
``intellectual who isn't afraid of making decisions.''
	   Gen. Yuri Kobaladze, chief spokesman for the Foreign
Intelligence Service, said Friday: ``People in the intelligence
service love Grigory Rapota very much and felt sorry when he
left,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Rapota said Friday he would ensure the continuity of
Rosvooruzheniye's work and observe all its obligations.
	   He said he wasn't surprised by his appointment, because he had
been approached about the job some time ago, the Interfax news
agency reported.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Taxis throughout Norway stood still for one
hour Friday during the funeral of a cabbie murdered by a passenger
two weeks ago.
	   Ulf Joergen Braathen, 42, was shot four times and killed in his
cab just before midnight on Nov. 15 for no apparent reason, leading
to a nationwide outcry against violence.
	   ``Your death has resulted in all of Norway becoming determined
not to allow violence to take over our daily lives,'' said Wiggo
Johansen of Oslo Taxi at the driver's funeral.
	   The murder sent a wave of anger, fear and grief through the
nation's cabbies. Many now drive with black mourning bands taped
across their white, roof-mounted taxi signs.
	   Braathen's murder became a symbol of Norwegians' concern that
senseless violence is taking root in their traditionally safe and
peaceful country of 4.4 million.
	   Citizens and political leaders joined the cabbies in shows of
outrage and grief over the killing.
	   ``We feel the protest growing inside us. We don't want a society
in which fear controls us,'' said Lutheran minister Sonja Fauske
during her eulogy for Braathen. The church, which seats about 700,
was packed, with mourners standing in the aisles and the vestibule.
	   Despite occasional problems, including robberies, Norwegian cab
drivers have generally been safe behind the wheel, with no need for
physical barriers to separate them from passengers. Now many demand
the installation of video-cameras to monitor passengers.
	   Drivers in the capital twice in the past two weeks parked their
cabs for an hour to protest violence and honor their colleague. On
Friday, the rest of the country's cabbies joined them in refusing
fares during the hour-long funeral service.
	   Two men, ages 19 and 23, were arrested and charged with
murdering Braathen.

Report could vindicate Virenque's claim of innocence, paper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Doping tests on Richard Virenque, the top cyclist
at the Festina team thrown out of the Tour de France, proved
negative, French sports daily L'Equipe said Friday.
	   A medical report made available to Virenque's advisers shows
that tests carried out on the cyclist on July 17, five days after
Tour organizers expelled Festina, ``exclude all traces of growth
hormones, anabolic steroids and corticoids or masking products,''
the paper said.
	   Though several of his Festina colleagues have admitted taking
the banned substance erythropoietin (EPO), Virenque has always
denied he took drugs to enhance his performance.
	   Next Tuesday, Patrick Keil, the Lille judge investigating the
use of banned doping substances at Festina, is to call Virenque and
two of his Festina teammates to discuss the report.
	   According to L'Equipe, which did not cite its sources, the
report says that the French cyclist had an EPO level of 4.4
micrograms per milliliter, below the 12 to 15 micrograms per
milliliter level that normally indicates EPO usage.
	   EPO is naturally produced by the body, so small traces would be
normal.

Prisoners' Association. On Wednesday, 125 prisoners at Shata Prison
near the Israeli town of Beit Shean joined the fast, Karakeh said.
	   ``We received a letter that was smuggled out of Shata prison
late Thursday night informing us of the strike,'' Karakeh said.
	   The prisoners said in the note that they hoped that all other
Palestinian prisoners would join the hunger strike.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel.
	   Prisoner releases are an emotionally charged issue because
nearly every Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by
Israel at one time. Prisoner releases are seen as a gauge of
whether peace agreements bring real benefits.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, meanwhile, Palestinians stoned
Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers after settlers blocked
Palestinian motorists from using a road near their enclave and then
marched into the Palestinian-run sector.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse the
stone-throwers and eventually escorted the group of about 20
settlers, most of them women, back into the Israeli-controlled
downtown area.
	   In Jerusalem, the chief Muslim cleric bristled at Israeli
charges that the sermons delivered in mosques in the West Bank,
Gaza and Jerusalem are often used to incite against Israel.
	   The mufti of Jerusalem, Ikrema Sabri, said in a sermon delivered
at Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, that ``as teachers
and scholars we will continue with our sermons and we will continue
with our religious duties.''
	   Friday sermons are broadcast live on the Voice of Palestine
radio station. Preachers often attack Israel for policies such as
land confiscations, home demolitions and settlement activities.
Preachers frequently call on Muslims to unite against infidels.
	   Last week, Israel and the Palestinians sat down to tackle the
issue of incitement in a committee established at the request of
Israel as part of last month's peace agreement.
	   The Palestinian Authority issued an anti-incitement decree, but
Israel said it was not enough.

Dubliner convicted of murdering crime journalist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A three-judge court on Friday convicted a
Dublin drugs dealer of murdering investigative journalist Veronica
Guerin, nearly 2 1/2 years after the reporter was gunned down
behind the wheel of her car, and sentenced him to life.
	   The judges of the Special Criminal Court accepted that Paul
``Hippo'' Ward, 34, was part of the gang that targeted Guerin for
assassination in reprisal for her reports into Dublin's criminal
underworld. His lawyers said they were considering an appeal.
	   Prosecutors admitted that Ward was not the triggerman, but said
he should be held equally liable for Guerin's murder because he
disposed of the handgun and motorcycle used by two accomplices to
ambush the 36-year-old journalist as she sat at a traffic light in
June 1996.
	   Critical to Ward's conviction was the word of fellow gang member
Charles Bowden _ the first time in the legal history of the Irish
Republic that a court has accepted uncorroborated testimony as the
basis for a conviction. Bowden was the first person to receive
state protection in a witness-protection program that authorities
introduced specifically in response to Guerin's June 1996 murder.
	   The senior judge in the special court, Justice Robert Barr, said
he and his two colleagues found Bowden's account of the planning of
Guerin's killing credible.
	   Bowden testified that he, Ward and three associates discussed
her killing; that he loaded the .357 Magnum used in the attack and
delivered it to two others; and that those two others had Ward
dispose of the motorcycle and gun.
	   The judges' ruling was highly critical of how police procured
three disputed confessions from Ward, which prosecutors had offered
as corroborating evidence for Bowden's claims.
	   Barr said the judges doubted whether Ward had confessed at all
and threw out all three of the detectives' written statements. He
said police had violated Ward's constitutional rights to due
process during their interrogations, particularly by using visits
by his mother and girlfriend to weaken him psychologically.
	   Ward, who had been behind bars since his October 1996 arrest,
remained stony and silent throughout the more than 45 minutes it
took Barr to read the judges' ruling. He had testified that he was
a member along with Bowden in a drug-dealing gang, but denied
having anything to do with Guerin's death.
	   His case was heard by the Special Criminal Court _ normally
reserved for anti-terrorist cases _ because authorities feared that
Ward's criminal friends might pose a threat to jurors.
	   His trial began last month after several months' argument as to
whether his lawyers were entitled to see police documents related
to his own alleged confessions and the terms for Bowden's agreement
to become a state-protected witness.
	   Two of Ward's alleged associates are awaiting trial for Guerin's
murder. Bowden is expected to testify against them both.
	   Brian Meehan, the brother of Ward's girlfriend, faces his murder
trial in June, while John Gilligan, the alleged boss of the gang,
is still fighting extradition from England, where he is imprisoned
on drugs-trafficking offenses.

Newspaper rules on best Dutch alternatives for Anglicisms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The word ``stalker'' has crept
stealthily into the Dutch language. Now purists say it's time to
get rid of it _ along with the rest of the English that's been
sneaking into the Low Countries' lexicon.
	   Why not call a stalker a ``dwangvolger'' _ a Dutch word that
translates into ``compulsive follower'' _ expert and armchair
linguists alike want to know.
	   While the Dutch are far from the aggressive guardians of their
language that the French have become, a recent newspaper article
asking for substitutes to widely used English words has unleashed
an avalanche of responses.
	   From ``airbag'' to ``website'' and ``aquaplaning'' to
``understatement,'' the respected daily NRC Handelsblad sought
native replacements for 40 English intruders.
	   Its appeal has touched a nerve: In two weeks, 450 linguists from
around the world sent in 11,000 suggestions. The best were
published this week.
	   As well as sending in words, some readers also felt the need to
``vent their spleen about the `unwholesome influence' of English,''
journalist and language historian Ewoud Sanders wrote.
	   The discussion even was raised in parliament recently when Rick
van der Ploeg, the state secretary for culture, was criticized for
using English words such as ``break dance'' and ``freaks'' in an
otherwise Dutch speech.
	   ``I have the feeling that the love of the Dutch language still
has some growing to do,'' observed Dick-Jan Stellingwerf of the
Protestant party Reformed Political Federation.
	   Many people speak excellent English in the Netherlands, where
schoolchildren are taught it from age 11. British and American
stations are available to most cable television viewers, and in
cinemas films are generally screened with subtitles rather than
dubbed into Dutch.
	   But words and phrases like ``junk food,'' ``pinup'' and
``name-dropping'' are increasingly cropping up in the middle of
Dutch sentences.
	   With the advent of the Internet, the flow has increased: NRC
Handelsblad readers came up with Dutch alternatives for ``home
page,'' ``hyperlink'' and ``website,'' all of which have been
downloaded directly into Dutch.
	   A French law passed in 1994, bans advertisements in any single
language except French. It also decrees that manufacturers cannot
sell goods without instructions in French and broadcasters cannot
use English words on TV and radio when French equivalents exist.
	   No such law exists in the Netherlands, and the NRC Handelsblad
is not seeking one.
	   ``For all clarity: The jury has absolutely nothing against
borrowed words generally or English words in particular,'' wrote
Sanders.
	   ``They can, for various reasons, be very useful but it is still
worthwhile looking for Dutch equivalents that roll off the tongue,
are immediately clear, don't present spelling problems and, if
necessary, are easy to conjugate.''
	   Some words, however, seem to have been here too long. The jury
evaluating the entries found no suitable translations for ``human
interest'' or ``spin-off'' among the 436 suggestions.
	   Better luck, or _ as the Dutch would say, ``success'' _ next
time.

Russian liberals unite against hard-liners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Leaders of prominent reformist groups announced
plans Friday to form a major coalition to prevent Communists from
returning to power.
	   Russian liberals have been galvanized by last week's murder of
prominent democratic lawmaker Galina Starovoitova. Her death _
coming in the wake of a scandal around anti-Semitic statements by a
Communist lawmaker, and the party's failure to censure him _ has
prompted speculation that Russia's hard-liners are growing
increasingly confident and are willing to go to great length to
achieve political domination.
	   Speculations about the Communists' involvement in the murder
have not been publicly corroborated by any evidence.
	   Several liberal leaders have called for a need of a joint front
against hard-liners. On Friday a group of prominent reformers
signed a document launching a coalition, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Members include Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister and leader
of a democratic party, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko,
ex-deputy premiers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, President
Boris Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev and several
regional governors.
	   However, Russian liberal groups have been torn apart by rivalry
in the past, and the prospects of their union remained unclear.
	   The leader of the most outspoken and consistently liberal
movement, Grigory Yavlinsky, has refused to join the coalition,
taking a maverick stand as he has done many times in the past.
	   Parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, said the
group will last ``no more than a month,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. The liberals will fight bitterly over selecting a leader
and ``as a result of it, they will all perish,'' Seleznyov
predicted.
	   The group has yet to work out a platform and select a leader,
Sysuyev said, according to ITAR-Tass.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Despite pressure from Italy, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Friday that Germany will not seek to extradite rebel
Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan on murder and terror charges.
	   Instead, Italy and Germany immediately will push for the
formation of an international court where Ocalan could be tried,
Schroeder announced after meeting with Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
	   While Italy arrested the Kurdish leader on a German warrant,
Germany is reluctant to bring him here for trial, fearing unrest
among Germany's 2 million Turks _ about one-quarter of them Kurds.
	   Schroeder pointed out that Germany has more Turkish Kurds than
any other European nation _ 400,000 _ and he asked D'Alema to
understand his position. D'Alema said he took Schroeder's concerns
seriously.
	   Even as the politicians met in Bonn, thousands of Turkish Kurds
began gathering there for a rally supporting Ocalan, the leader of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a
14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The conflict has killed
37,000 people.
	   Police expected 30,000 protesters on Friday, and Kurdish groups
have announced protests for Saturday in several cities around
Germany.
	   After the meeting, Schroeder said Germany and Italy will work
with Turkey to help it resolve the question of Kurdish autonomy at
home. ``We want a friendly, normal relations with Turkey,'' the
chancellor said.

 &UR; EDS: ADDS Moroccan delegation going to Libya grafs 9-11; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has protested
against being left out of the French-African summit that opened in
Paris Friday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The complaint was made in a letter Gadhafi sent to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who is attending the conference, MENA said
quoting Libya's ambassador to France, Ali Treki.
	   France said it could not invite Libya and Sudan because their
countries are under U.N. sanctions.
	   This explanation ``is not convincing,'' Gadhafi wrote in the
letter, MENA said quoting Treki.
	   Gadhafi said it is surprising that Libya was ignored even though
it was an African country. But he apparently stopped short of
blaming host France. Gadhafi and Mubarak have a good relationship
and Egypt has in the past supported Libya's participation in
international meetings.
	   ``This summit cannot discuss security in Africa without Libya
and Sudan's participation,'' Treki quoted Gadhafi's letter as
saying. MENA said Treki delivered the letter to Mubarak Friday.
	   Security is the focus of the two-day summit that has drawn 49
African nations, and 34 heads of state. It was opened by French
President Jacques Chirac.
	   Libya is under a U.N. flight ban, imposed in 1992 to try to
force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988
bombing of an American airliner of Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast
killed 270 people.
	   In Rabat, Morocco, on Friday, a group of former Cabinet
ministers and politicians left for Tripoli to express their support
for Libya.
	   ``This trip is a manifestation of our solidarity with the Libyan
people, since 6 million Libyans are sanctioned because of two
suspected terrorists,'' Mohammed Ziane, a former minister of human
rights, told reporters.
	   The group plans to fly to Djerba, Tunisia, from where it will
cross into Libya by road.
	   African countries voted to ignore the flight ban at an
Organization of African Unity summit in June. Subsequently several
African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad and Sudan,
have defied the sanctions by flying directly to Libya.

Rugova says talks on Kosovo not far off

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, as
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said the American-drafted proposal
for a political settlement is being revised in efforts to achieve
progress in the peace process, which he said is fast reaching a
make-or-break point.
	   Meanwhile, in a step hailed by a Western official as a ``small
but very important gesture,'' ethnic Albanian rebels freed two
journalists from the Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted
Oct. 18. Western diplomats helped negotiate the two men's release.
	   Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the U.S. and European envoys for
Kosovo, met in the capital Pristina to discuss the international
initiative in Kosovo.
	   Hill has been trying to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to
both Serbs and Albanians, but so far his ideas have been rejected
by Serbia and only cautiously supported by ethnic Albanian
politicians.
	   The two sides' positions over Kosovo are still far apart. Serbia
wants to keep the province, which it considers the cradle of its
statehood, firmly under its control. The majority ethnic Albanians
want independence.
	   But Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the Albanians' independence
movement, said at a news conference in Pristina, that ``we are not
far from political negotiations.''
	   Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some progress in
U.S.-led efforts to bring the two sides closer together. There are
fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh fighting by spring if those
efforts fail.
	   Rugova said talks ``should be well-prepared.'' He dismissed
attempts by Serbia to organize talks without international
involvement as ``a well-known show.''
	   ``I do believe we are getting to another critical moment,'' Hill
said later of continuing resistance by both sides to the current
plan.
	   ``I think everyone understands that what has been going on in
Kosovo can't continue. We've got to move on to a political
solution. I am optimistic that everyone has got that message,'' he
said.
	   Serbian officials earlier this week tried to push forward their
own peace plan which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia with a
form of self-rule.
	   Hill has discussed his plan with ethnic Albanian rebels, whose
support is crucial.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   In the presence of chief international observer William Walker,
the rebels on Friday set free two Tanjug journalists _ reporter
Nebojsa Radosevic, 32, and photographer Vladimir Dobricic, 50 _ in
the guerrilla stronghold of Dragobilje in central Kosovo.
	   Walker, who heads the Kosovo observation mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, praised the
release.
	   ``This is obviously very good news for the detainees and their
families but I think it's also good news for Kosovo,'' Walker said.
``We in the OSCE see this as a small but very important gesture _ a
confidence-building measure we hope will be taken advantage of.''
	   The KLA said it abducted the journalists after they drove into
rebel-held territory.
	   The rebels also released two local officials from Rugova's party
whom they abducted Oct. 31.

	   BRINDISI, Italy (AP) _ A speeding motor boat with smugglers at
the helm crashed into a dinghy filled with ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo on Friday, killing three would-be immigrants, including
a baby.
	   Another four of the would-be immigrants were missing and feared
dead.
	   Ten refugees managed to swim to a nearby oil platform. Italy's
coast guard later accompanied the group ashore, taking three people
who were suffering from exposure to the hospital.
	   Authorities said at least 17 ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo
were in the boat, which left from the Albanian port of Durres
overnight. The accident occurred about 35 kilometers (22 miles)
east of Brindisi, on Italy's southern coast.
	   The smugglers, who were unhurt, sped away from the scene
immediately after the collision.
	   ``We must help the immigrants when they arrive,'' said the head
of Italy's tax police, Rolando Moschini. ``The smugglers and
mobsters are the ones who must be arrested.''

Syryjczyk was first post-communist industry minister in 1st, 5th

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Tadeusz Syryjczyk, Poland's first
post-communist industry minister, was nominated Friday to become
the new transport minister after the previous one resigned over
labor influence on restructuring the state railway company.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said he asked President Aleksander
Kwasniewski to approve the nomination.
	   An adviser to Kwasniewski, who is visiting Morocco until Dec. 3,
said he expected the president to approve the appointment upon his
return.
	   Syryjczyk, 50, is a leader of the Freedom Union, a junior
partner in the Solidarity-led governing coalition.
	   A specialist in industry and computers, he was the industry
minister in Poland's first democratic government in 1989 and later
served as a government adviser.
	   Syryjczyk would succeed Eugeniusz Morawski, also of the Freedom
Union, who resigned Monday in a dispute over the influence of
organized labor in government plans to reform the heavily indebted,
inefficient state railway system.
	   Syryjczyk told the PAP state news agency Friday he would
continue the policies of Morawski, including the restructuring of
the railway company, building new roads and selling off the
national airline.
	   The government is negotiating terms of restructuring the
railway, Polskie Koleje Panstwowe, with labor unions that oppose
job losses, a significant element of the reform plan.
	   In recent years, the railway company inherited from the
communist era has been cutting train connections and increasing
ticket prices to prevent further losses.

Rugova says talks on Kosovo not far off
</HEADLINE>

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo said Friday that talks on the province might start soon, and
top international envoys pressed ahead with Western diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis.
	   Ibrahim Rugova said at a news conference in Pristina, the
capital of the Serbian province, that ``we are not far from
political negotiations.''
	   Rugova's comments indicate that there has been some progress in
U.S.-led efforts to bring the Serbs and ethnic Albanians closer
together. There are fears that Kosovo will explode in fresh
fighting by spring if those efforts fail.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said the American-drafted proposal
for a political settlement is being revised.
	   ``I do believe we are getting to another critical moment,'' Hill
said. ``I think everyone understands that what has been going on in
Kosovo can't continue. We've got to move on to a political
solution. I am optimistic that everyone has got that message.''
	   Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European envoy for Kosovo, met
in the capital, Pristina, to discuss the international initiative.
	   Hill has been trying to hammer out a peace deal acceptable to
both sides, but so far his ideas have been rejected by Serbia and
only cautiously supported by ethnic Albanian politicians.
	   Serbia wants to keep the province, which it considers the cradle
of its state, firmly under its control. The majority ethnic
Albanians want independence. Serbia is, in turn, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown in
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others in the province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   Earlier in the week, Serbian officials tried to push forward
their own peace plan, which envisages Kosovo remaining in Serbia
with a form of self-rule.
	   On Friday, ethnic Albanian rebels freed two journalists from the
Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted Oct. 18. Western
diplomats helped negotiate the men's release.
	   Chief international observer William Walker, who heads the
Kosovo observation mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, praised the release.
	   ``We in the OSCE see this as a small but very important gesture
_ a confidence-building measure we hope will be taken advantage
of,'' Walker said.
	   The rebels also released two local officials from Rugova's party
whom they abducted Oct. 31.

Twenty killed in fighting between Somali rivals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Twenty people were killed and many
others wounded in escalating fighting between rival within the same
clan in southwestern Somalia, officials said Friday.
	   Sources reached by VHF radio said battles Thursday in the
district of Sakow were the worst in 12 days of fighting, claiming
20 lives, including of some civilians.
	   Fighting broke out between the factions of the Rahanwein clan
Nov. 15 over employment with a Swedish relief agency that was
developing water supplies and health services in Sakow, 380
kilometers (240 miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu.
	   Moallimweyneh clansmen accuse rival Geladleh subclansmen of
depriving them of jobs with Swedish Church Relief, local sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Swedish Church Relief said it was not involved in the fighting
in Sakow, but had stopped working there because of violence.
	   Elders of the two groups met in Mogadishu Thursday, and agreed
to an unconditional cease-fire and talks between the sides. But
sources said fighting continued Friday.
	   On Wednesday, 15 Geladleh fighters were killed when Mallimweyneh
fighters pushed northeast of Sakow to the Qansahdhereh district,
the sources said. The first two days of fighting claimed 21 lives
and wounded 40.
	   Command of Sakow town changed hands more than once.
	   The two groups are indigenous to the Sakow district, which had
been one of the few regions of Somalia to remain quiet since rival
clans ousted President Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, then turned on
each other.
	   Somalia has since been without a central government and faction
leaders have carved the country into militia-protected fiefdoms.

Libya complains about not being invited to African summit

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has protested
being left out of the French-African summit that opened in Paris on
Friday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The complaint was made in a letter Gadhafi sent to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who is attending the conference, MENA
said, quoting Libya's ambassador to France, Ali Treki.
	   Gadhafi and Mubarak have a good relationship and Egypt has in
the past supported Libya's participation in international meetings.
	   France said it could not invite Libya and Sudan because their
countries are under U.N. sanctions.
	   This explanation ``is not convincing,'' Gadhafi wrote in the
letter, MENA said.
	   Gadhafi said it is surprising that Libya was ignored, but
apparently stopped short of blaming France.
	   ``This summit cannot discuss security in Africa without Libya
and Sudan's participation,'' Treki quoted Gadhafi's letter as
saying. MENA said Treki delivered the letter to Mubarak on Friday.
	   Security is the focus of the two-day summit that has drawn
representatives from 49 African nations, and 34 heads of state. It
was opened by French President Jacques Chirac.
	   Libya is under a U.N. flight ban imposed in 1992 to try to force
Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988
bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast
killed 270 people.
	   African countries decided in June to ignore the flight ban, and
several African leaders, including the heads of Congo, Chad and
Sudan, have defied the sanctions by flying directly to Libya.
	   In Rabat, Morocco, on Friday, a group of former Cabinet
ministers and politicians left for Tripoli to express their support
for Libya.
	   ``This trip is a manifestation of our solidarity with the Libyan
people, since 6 million Libyans are sanctioned because of two
suspected terrorists,'' said Mohammed Ziane, a former minister of
human rights.
	   The group plans to fly to Djerba, Tunisia, then cross into Libya
by road.
	   African countries voted to ignore the flight ban at an
Organization of African Unity summit in June. Subsequently several
African leaders, including the heads of Congo, Chad and Sudan, have
defied the sanctions by flying directly to Libya.

`Love Boat' in stormy waters after drug bust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ All passengers were allowed ashore Friday
from the cruise ship made famous by the ``The Love Boat''
television show after a stash of heroin was found on board.
	   The nearly 600 passengers were held on the Pacific Princess
while authorities searched the vessel. Two crew members were
arrested after police say they discovered about 25 kilograms (56
pounds) of heroin in their cabin Thursday.
	   The ship had sailed from Turkey to the port of Piraeus, about 10
kilometers (six miles) from Athens, as part of a one-week
Mediterranean cruise.
	   The Pacific Princess was used as the setting for the popular
1977-86 show ``The Love Boat'' _ where lovelorn passengers always
were able to find romance.
	   The ship, which was moved from the Pacific to the Mediterranean
in the late 1980s, should be able to continue its voyage without
delays, said a spokesman for its owner, London-based P&AMP;O Cruises.

Prime minister fires agriculture minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile fired
Agriculture Minister Dinu Gavrilescu on Friday and said Gavrilescu
would be replaced by the reform minister.
	   ``The premier decided to fire Gavrilescu because of continuous
delays in agriculture reforms,'' said government spokesman Rasvan
Popescu.
	   Gavrilescu was appointed minister after reformists won elections
in November 1996.
	   He was one of the most controversial figures in the government,
accused by media of mismanagement of state-owned farms, where tens
of thousands of animals starved to death in 1997.
	   He also failed to implement reforms that would have brought
Romania badly needed loans for agriculture.
	   Gavrilescu failed to speed up the modernization and
privatization of state-owned farms. He also was accused of not
supporting small- and medium-size entrepreneurs in the agriculture
sector. And he failed to implement several programs supported by
the World Bank.
	   Romania was once the breadbasket of the region, but agriculture
is vastly underfinanced. Farming is still done using animals
instead of tractors.
	   Vasile said he would replace Gavrilescu with Reform Minister
Ioan Muresan. Muresan, 39, is an engineer who became reform
minister in April. The Reform Ministry is responsible for
coordinating privatization.
	   The government recently announced it planned to reduce the
number of ministries in a move to speed up privatization. There
currently are 22 ministries, and several duplicate efforts,
particularly in privatization.
	   The government plans to eliminate five ministries. Among those
to be abolished is the Reform Ministry, with responsibilities
shifted to the prime minister.
	   The reshuffle needs to be approved by President Emil
Constantinescu.
	   Over the past two years, the government has been divided by
political feuds between the four political groupings.
	   There have been numerous government reshuffles, which culminated
with former Premier Victor Ciorbea resigning earlier this year.

Jordanian king says he may return home in January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein said Friday he may return home
in early January after a sixth and final round of chemotherapy
treatment for cancer.
	   It was the first time Jordanians had heard of a return date for
Hussein, 63, who has been in the United States since July 13 to
receive treatment for a non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
	   ``I expect I will return to my beloved home either in late
December or early January,'' the king said in a letter to Zeid
Rifai, speaker of the Upper House of Parliament or senate.
	   Last week the king assured his countrymen that five rounds of
chemotherapy at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, have
completely cured him. But he said he would undergo a marrow
transplant in late November to ensure that the cancer will not
recur.
	   In his letter to Rifai, which was carried by the state-run Petra
News Agency, Hussein said the operation would be carried out next
week.
	   The king said that during the transplant, he would be confined
to bed and ``not allowed to receive visitors because of the
diminished immunity level as result of chemical treatment.''
	   Petra said the letter was in response to affirmations of loyalty
expressed by both houses of Parliament last week _ a constitutional
formality if the king is out of the country for more than four
months.
	   It is the first time the king has been absent for so long since
he ascended to the throne at the age of 17 in 1953.

Tajikistan puts death toll during recent fighting at 334
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A rebellion in northern Tajikistan earlier this
month left 334 government troops and rebels dead and many more
wounded _ including 170 civilians, officials said Friday.
	   Immediately after the Nov. 4-9 fighting, led by a former army
commander in the central Asian nation, the government said about
200 people were killed.
	   On Friday, government officials in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital,
told the Interfax news agency that 114 government troops and 220
rebels were killed. They said 431 troops and 215 rebels were
wounded, and 75 rebels were taken prisoner.
	   At least 170 civilians were also wounded. The fighting cost
Tajikistan's government 5.2 billion Tajik rubles (dlrs 5.2
million), the report said.
	   Government troops crushed the rebellion after a few days of
fierce fighting in the mountainous former Soviet republic, but the
rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, and several of
his fighters remain at large.
	   They had demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all
political prisoners and bring his supporters into the government.

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Carlos Moya, who had not won an indoor
match all year until this week, reached the semifinals of the ATP
Tour World Championship when he beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5 on
Friday.
	   Moya is usually not much of a threat on indoor courts and
prefers clay, the surface on which he won the French Open, and hard
courts.
	   Although indoors, the ATP championship is played on a hard court
and Moya has done well at this elite season-ending event, reaching
the semifinals for the second consecutive year.
	   By avenging his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last year, he
ousted the Russian from the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that
nominally brings the top eight players of the year.
	   ``I was perhaps luckier in important moments,'' Moya said. ``I
had to be like a wall, put back every ball. I was mentally stronger
than last year.''
	   Moya, No. 4 in the world, joined top-ranked Pete Sampras and Tim
Henman in the last four and will face Henman on Saturday.
	   Moya's first indoor victory of the season after five defeats
came at the start of the round-robin portion, when he beat Karol
Kucera. He lost to Sampras and finished behind him in one of the
four-man groups.
	   In later matches, Henman played Greg Rusedski and Alex Corretja
battled Albert Costa. Corretja can clinch the last semifinal spot
if he beats Costa.
	   Sampras had a day off and an opportunity to savor his historic
achievement _ holding to the No. 1 ranking for the sixth
consecutive year.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras
said after breaking the record he held jointly with Jimmy Connors.
	   There are new milestones to achieve as well: Sampras is one
title short of the 12 Grand Slam tournaments won by Roy Emerson.
	   And there is the French Open on clay, the only one Sampras
hasn't won. ``That's the biggest challenge,'' he said.
	   Staying No. 1 for six consecutive years, Sampras said, required
a lot of hard work.
	   ``It was well worth the sacrifice,'' he said just before
champagne was poured over his head at a little ceremony. He
returned the favor, showering ATP Tour chief Mark Miles and
promoter Ion Tiriac.
	   There was also a cake representing the figure six, with a
chocolate tennis ball inside the circle.
	   ``It's an ultimate achievement, it will probably never be
broken,'' he said. ``I'm trying to stay humble through all this,
but the record speaks for itself. It's a little overwhelming.''
	   Sampras was assured of the record when Marcelo Rios of Chile,
the only player with a chance to overtake him, pulled out of the
ATP championship because of a back injury.
	   Rios trailed Sampras 33 points on the computer rankings.
	   Having won his first two round-robin matches, Sampras was
already assured a semifinal berth before he played Karol Kucera on
Thursday. A relaxed Sampras then demonstrated why he is No. 1,
crushing Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes.
	   Kucera is No. 7 and beat Sampras once in their three previous
matches this year.
	   If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the event in
1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   After Andre Agassi, Rios was the second player to pull out of
the tournament that nominally brings together the top eight players
of the year.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Galatasaray's Romanian strikers on Friday
assured Juventus players of their safety during next week's
Champions League match, while police prevented anti-Italian
protests to ease down tensions.
	   ``Don't be afraid, come Zidane,'' said two Romanian strikers of
Galatasaray, Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorge Hagi, in a joint
statement published by the daily sports newspaper, Fanatik. ``We
are your guarantee.''
	   Zidane and several other Juventus players have refused to play
the match in Turkey because of anti-Italian sentiment running high
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader,
Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' Zidane said. ``I
speak only for myself, but all of my teammates think the same way.
Galatasaray-Juventus should be played in a country other than
Turkey.''
	   UEFA already has moved the game originally slated for Wednesday,
to Dec. 2.
	   Reportedly Juventus was still seeking a neutral venue but
Turkish police seem determined to reduce the tension and blocked a
group of demonstrators from reaching the Italian consulate on
Thursday.
	   On Friday, Turkey's sports minister Yucel Seckiner said that
Lennart Johansson, president of UEFA, assured Turkish officials
that the game would be played in Istanbul next Wednesday.
	   ``I invite our people to behave with a common sense,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted Seckiner as saying.
	   Police had tolerated violent protests over the past week around
the country, where demonstrators set fire to a Fiat car, a
motorbike and numerous Italian flags and silk, Italian-made ties.
	   Seckiner has also invited his Italian counterpart Giovanna
Melandri to attend the match. It was not clear if she would accept
the invitation.
	   ``We two sports people should not allow terrorism, the common
enemy of our nations, to affect and tarnish the atmosphere of this
match,'' Seckiner said.
	   Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim challenged Juventus.
	   ``We will play at home,'' said Terim. ``But if this not happens,
we will topple them anywhere.''

Police recover stolen Mondrian, arrest suspected thieves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDELBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Police recovered a painting by
abstract pioneer Piet Mondrian and arrested three people suspected
of snatching it from a museum, officials said Friday.
	   The oil painting titled ``The Tree'' was stolen from the Zeeuws
Museum in this southwestern Dutch town on Sept. 25. It was found
unharmed in a house in the Belgian city of Antwerp on Thursday, a
day after police arrested two men and a woman suspected of the
theft.
	   The suspects, whose identities and nationalities were not
released, are accused of stealing the painting and demanding a
ransom for its return. They told detectives where to find the
Mondrian following their arrest in the southern Dutch city of
Heerlen.
	   In a press release issued Friday, police did not say how much
money the thieves had demanded or whether any cash had changed
hands. The museum bought the painting in 1994 for 260,000 guilders
(dlrs 138,300).
	   The 27-by-38-centimeter (11-by-15 inch) painting, created by the
Dutch master between 1908 and 1909, shows a black apple tree
against a dark blue background. The oil-on-paper attached to cloth
was neither signed nor dated.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Friday began
compiling its first all-race voter list, but confusion marred the
day and even President Nelson Mandela registered at the wrong site.
	   South Africans lined up at schools, churches and other sites to
register for the 1999 election, the first since the 1994's all-race
balloting which marked the end of apartheid.
	   In Soweto, a sprawling black township and the scene of frequent
uprisings against white rule, about 50 men and women sat quietly in
a classroom at a run-down school with broken windows, awaiting
their turn to register. Some waited as long as six hours.
	   As a woman with a baby bound to her back by a blanket stood up
to register, one man murmured: ``We don't mind waiting. For us, it
is important to vote.''
	   There was less patience in a community center in the integrated,
run-down Johannesburg neighborhood of Yeoville, where dozens of
people were turned away after being told they were in the wrong
place.
	   It was only on Friday that many of the 12.7 million potential
voters in the northern section of the country learned which
registration site they should go to. Instructions were often vague
and many sites didn't open because civil servants who were supposed
to staff them failed to appear. The southern half of the country
registers on Dec. 4-6.
	   Opposition parties blasted the government.
	   ``The chaotic start of the registration process poses a serious
threat to a free and fair election,'' said the National Party,
which ruled during apartheid.
	   Mandela went to an elementary school in Johannesburg and duly
registered in front of photographers, but later was told the
Independent Electoral Commission had directed him to the wrong
place, said Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African National
Congress. Masebe said Mandela would probably have to reregister.
	   ``I'm so sick of the muddle and disorganization of the bloody
ANC government,'' complained Barbara Durlacher, a 65-year-old white
who was told she was at the wrong site.
	   Mandela, however, beckoned whites to join the ANC and abandon
the National Party that ruled during apartheid and turned South
Africa into ``the world's polecat.''
	   He told a Foreign Correspondents Association dinner Thursday
night that the ANC needed a two-thirds majority in parliament ``to
ensure that we are not interfered with by Mickey Mouse parties who
have no commitment to democracy.'' The majority would allow the
party to independently pass legislation.
	   Election officials, soldiers and civil servants including
teachers and secretaries helped people register. Among problems
Friday:
	   _The IEC failed to set up registration stations for nearly
10,000 potential voters in areas of North West Province, the ANC
charged.
	   _The school where Mandela was supposed to have registered was
one of about 50 registration points in eastern Johannesburg which
did not open because personnel failed to arrive.
	   IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler acknowledged the problems.
	   ``It's an immensely complicated exercise,'' he said. ``We'll
patch it up. We'll make it good before we're finished with it.''
	   Elections are likely to take place next May. No date has been
set.

Gen. Wesley Clark at the end of NATO exercise in Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CERKLJE, Slovenia (AP) _ NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, thanked Slovenia on Friday for hosting a
military maneuver that the alliance held for the first time in this
former Yugoslav country.
	   Clark arrived Friday for a one-day visit to observe the
operation, code-named Exercise Cooperative Adventure Exchange 1998.
	   The exercise closed later in the day. More than 5,500 troops
from the eight member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and 10 nations of the Alliance's Partnership for Peace
program were participating in the operation.
	   Slovenia became a member of the Partnership for Peace soon after
it proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslav federation in
1991. It hopes to be invited to join the Alliance in the next round
of expansion. In summer of 1997 Hungary, Poland and the Czech
Republic were invited to join NATO.
	   Up to 1,200 Slovene soldiers participated in the exercise, which
was aimed as a rehearse for peace support operation.
	   Clark said the exercise was productive and conducted well.
	   Slovenes now expect traffic jams as more than 3,500 NATO
vehicles and thousands of troops from across Europe pull out from
its territory.

Referendum results show Albania's constitution approved

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's first post-communist
constitution was approved by an overwhelming majority of voters in
last weekend's referendum, official results showed Friday.
	   The constitution, which Western officials have said is necessary
to strengthen the Balkan nation's fragile democracy, will take
effect once a presidential decree is signed.
	   Approval had been all but guaranteed after the opposition,
locked in a power struggle with the government, urged a boycott of
the vote by its supporters.
	   But the opposition Democratic Party rejected the results of the
referendum Friday and refused to acknowledge the new Constitution.
	   Sali Berisha, the party's fiery leader, claimed that Albanians
had rejected the document and said the turnout had been 39 percent.
He didn't say how he arrived at the figure.
	   ``If this were parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party
would have won two-thirds of the votes, '' said Berisha. He invited
Albanians to celebrate the claimed victory in a rally in Tirana on
Saturday, Albania's independence day.
	   But the Central Voting Commission's announcement that more than
half of registered voters participated is a good sign for the
government, which had feared a low turnout would weaken its hold on
power and worsen the atmosphere of political uncertainty in
Albania.
	   The Central Voting Commission announced that 93 percent of those
participating in the disputed referendum voted to adopt the
constitution, with a turnout of 50.57 percent.
	   The new constitution outlines civil, democratic and human rights
in the country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in
1991.
	   But it is unlikely to bring an end to the fierce political fight
between the ruling Socialists and the opposition Democrats.
	   Only a few hours after the voting started last Sunday, both
sides claimed victory.
	   The opposition also complained about what it called ``grave
incidents'' at several polling stations, including beatings of its
commissioners. Foreign observers said they saw no such incidences
of violence.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, accused officials of local
governments supportive of the Democratic Party of manipulating
voter lists by registering dead people and emigrants.
	   Foreign observers considered Sunday's vote an improvement over
last year's parliamentary elections, marred with violence and
irregularities.
	   Due to disagreements over results from local commissions, the
Central Voting Commission announced the final result early Friday
morning a couple of hours after the legal deadline had expired.
	   Despite the efforts of the Ambassador of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, Daan Everts, the opposition
members of the Central Voting Commission refused to agree on the
final result.
	   The Deputy Chief of the Commission, Pellumb Cela, of the
Democratic Party said the turnout was no more than 39 percent.
	   Recent opposition rallies against the referendum have not
generated the intensity of those in September that resulted in two
days of rioting and forced the ouster of the prime minister. Only
2,000 people showed up at the last Democratic rally earlier this
week.

Two countries do not rule out missiles may come to Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Cyprus refused Friday to rule
out the possibility that missiles destined for the divided island
may instead be sent to Greece.
	   But Greece's premier said it was the Cypriots' ultimate decision
on whether the Russian-made S-300 missiles will be sent to the
Greek island of Crete.
	   ``There is one principle: Cyprus decides,'' Costas Simitis said
after meeting Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides. ``In this case and
any other case, the Cyprus government will decide and there will be
consultations with Greece beforehand.''
	   Cyprus may be seeking a way around its pledge to deploy the
surface-to-air missiles and avoid a direct confrontation with
Turkey, which has suggested it could strike back with its powerful
military. Greece, which has a defense pledge with Cyprus, could be
drawn into a conflict.
	   Tension on Cyprus also could harm its bid for European Union
membership. Some EU nations have strong reservations about bringing
the Cyprus dispute into their fold.
	   U.S. special Cyprus envoy Richard Holbrooke is to visit Cyprus,
Greece and Turkey next week to discuss efforts to restart talks
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot.
	   According to officials in Athens, speaking on condition of
anonymity, Greece has discussed the possibility of a Crete
deployment with the United States.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish forces invaded its
northern third to protect the Turkish minority following a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece in 1974.
	   Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops in a northern break-away
state, which is only recognized by Ankara. Greece has built a
military air base on Cyprus.
	   Clerides, who was elected promising to bring the missiles to the
island, has avoided saying anything about the missiles. Purchased
earlier this year, he has twice postponed their deployment.
	   ``As far as the defense of Cyprus is concerned, both countries
have supported and expressed the view that Greece and Cyprus have
no interest in creating tensions. Turkey has an interest in
creating tensions,'' Simitis said.
	   But it was a decision by the Greek Cypriots to play a game of
high-stakes brinkmanship with the missiles that backfired when
Turkey called their bluff.
	   Turkey just last week warned Greece that war will break out if
the missiles are deployed on the island.
	   ``Our effort is the peaceful solution. Naturally, if Turkey
carries out any threats there can be no doubt that we are ready and
will defend ourselves,'' Clerides said in his only statement after
the meeting.

Schroeder says Germany has no intention of extraditing Ocalan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder acting to ``protect the peace,'''
Justice Ministry quote re fears of unrest among Turkish Kurds. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Despite pressure from Italy, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Friday that Germany will not seek to extradite rebel
Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan on murder and terror charges.
	   Instead, Italy and Germany immediately will push for the
formation of an international court where Ocalan could be tried,
Schroeder announced after meeting with Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
	   While Italy arrested the Kurdish leader on a German warrant,
Germany is reluctant to bring him here for trial, fearing unrest
among Germany's 2 million Turks _ about one-quarter of them Kurds.
	   Schroeder pointed out that Germany has more Turkish Kurds than
any other European nation _ 400,000 _ and that he ruled out seeking
extradition to ``protect the peace.'' D'Alema said he took
Schroeder's concerns seriously and that he could not judge
questions of German internal security.
	   Even as the politicians met in Bonn, thousands of Turkish Kurds
rallied nearby to support Ocalan, the leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year war for
Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Police said 11,000 protesters gathered on Friday, and Kurdish
groups have announced protests for Saturday in several cities
around Germany.
	   After the meeting, Schroeder said Germany and Italy will work
with Turkey to help it resolve the question of Kurdish autonomy at
home. ``We want a friendly, normal relations with Turkey,'' the
chancellor said.
	   Ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and murder charges in Turkey,
where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested Nov. 12 when he
arrived at the Rome airport aboard a flight from Moscow.
	   A Rome court freed him last Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant
because Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to
countries where they face the death penalty. The decision enraged
many in Turkey who consider Ocalan their most-wanted criminal.
Protesters have burned Italian clothes and cars and launched
boycotts against Italian products.
	   For now, Ocalan is under police surveillance at a Rome villa.
Judges have ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give
Germany time to mull over extradition. Germany, as well as the
other countries in the European Union, does not have the death
penalty.
	   Germany has two arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one
for a single murder charged in 1990 and another issued last
weekend. German media reports say the new, broader charges include
``liquidation of a string of dissidents'' in Germany in the 1980s
and a string of arson attacks in 1993. The attacks led Germany to
ban the PKK as a terrorist group the same year.
	   The Justice Ministry suggested it feared similar unrest if
Ocalan were brought here for trial.
	   ``Included in the political questions are domestic issues, and
question of how and if we deal with the Kurdish question,'' Justice
Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin was quoted as saying in the
Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper said Friday.
	   The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany, Mehmet
Tanriverdi, has asked the German government to help reach a
political settlement in Turkey on the question of Kurdish autonomy.
He also says Ocalan should be given asylum in Italy and be free to
travel in Europe.

Federations warned: unite on drugs or lose Olympic status

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The message to Olympic sports is
clear: get tough on drugs or you're out.
	   Soccer, cycling and tennis were warned Friday that they risk
being dropped from the Olympics unless they comply with uniform
anti-doping rules and sanctions.
	   Those three sports expressed reservations to the package of
anti-doping measures adopted at a meeting of the International
Olympic Committee and 35 international sports federations.
	   The agreement binds federations to abide by a unified medical
code that includes a minimum two-year suspension for athletes using
steroids or other major performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Athletes caught a second time would be banned for life.
	   On top of suspensions, federations can also impose fines or
other financial penalties and require athletes to submit to
unannounced followup testing.
	   Previous IOC guidelines recommended a two-year ban as a maximum
punishment. In some cases, different federations have applied
different sanctions for the same offense.
	   The IOC wants the 28 summer and seven winter federations to
apply common rules, procedures and penalties. Olympic leaders were
intent on getting all sports to fall in line before the Feb. 2-4
world anti-doping summit in Lausanne.
	   All federations agreed, except for objections raised by the
governing bodies of soccer (FIFA), tennis (ITF) and cycling (UCI).
These were the same three sports which failed to comply fully with
previous IOC attempts to harmonize doping policy.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was confident the
three dissenting federations would sign up to the agreement before
the Febuary conference.
	   ``These three federations have reservations, but after
consulting with their governing bodies, I'm sure they will agree,''
Samaranch said.
	   Despite the warning that federations must comply or risk their
Olympic status, Samaranch carefully avoided making any ultimatums.
	   ``I think all federations will remain on the Olympic program,''
he said. ``The policy of the IOC is not to threaten the
federations.''
	   FIFA's acting general secretary, Michael Zen-Ruffinen, objected
to the two-year sanction on grounds that the penalty might not
stand up in court and because certain prohibited drugs have no
performance-enhancing benefits in sports like soccer.
	   ``We agree that there should be a common position,'' he said.
``But we want to make an exception in certain cases. We need to
clarify things and find a compromise solution.''
	   Significantly, FIFA president Sepp Blatter skipped Friday's
meeting, traveling to South Africa instead to receive an award from
Nelson Mandela.
	   ``It's getting to be ridiculous,'' softball federation president
Don Porter said. ``They (FIFA chiefs) never come to these meetings.
They're not part of the team.''
	   Samaranch said he planned to meet with Blatter on Jan. 6 to try
to find an accord.
	   The cycling federation, whose sport was damaged by revelations
of systematic doping during the Tour de France, went along with the
two-year sanction.
	   But UCI president Hein Verbruggen said the penalty won't serve
much use because it won't be accepted by the legal system.
	   ``The rules have to be in line with what is acceptable to the
courts,'' he said. ``If we go to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport, they will never give two years.''
	   Soccer, tennis and cycling all objected when track and field
chief Primo Nebiolo pushed through a last-minute rule specifying
that sports which don't comply with the accord should be dropped
from the Olympics.
	   ``That was as strong a message as they could have received,''
said John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and
a leading advocate for hardline doping policy. ``The ultimate
sanction is participation in the Olympic Games.''
	   On another key issue, the federations expressed support for the
establishment of an independent agency to coordinate anti-doping
efforts around the world.
	   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who heads the project, said the
agency could be up and running early next year with initial funding
of dlrs 25 million from Olympic television revenues.
	   On other points, the federations:
	   _ called for cooperation on doping issues between sports bodies
and government authorities
	   _ pledged to intensify doping prevention policies through
educational and promotional campaigns
	   _ agreed to refer doping disputes to the Lausanne-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport once internal appeals procedures had been
exhausted.

Zimbabwe's Price shares lead in home tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Nick Price and two South Africans shared
the lead at the half-way mark of the Zimbabwe Open golf
championship Friday.
	   Price is joined by Tjaart van der Walt and Warren Abery on 137,
seven under par, after he shot a bogey free 68 over the Royal
Harare course that he redesigned two years ago.
	   ``After some serious practice, was driving well today and only
missed one fairway _ and that by just a yard,'' Price said. ``I
actually played better than my 68 and if I could have read the
breaks on the greens I would have had a lower score.''
	   Price has won his own country's open title twice and he is the
current champion. Previous winner and fellow Zimbabwean Tony
Johnstone is on 140 and well in contention. Compatriot Mark
McNulty, a double winner, is on 144 and he might now have too much
to do.
	   Best round of the day was by Adilson da Silva, a Brazilian. His
67 put him on 141 among a group of nine players.
	   In fourth place behind the leading trio is Mark Wiltshire, one
shot further back.
	   Fifth is Darren Fitchardt on 140 after an adventurous 68 which
included an eagle, six birdies and four dropped shots.
	   Van der Walt, who finished third in the Zimbabwe Open last year
is seen as the most likely of Price's main rivals to mount a
serious challenge to the world number eight over the weekend.

Moya, Rusedski win as Sampras stays No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Rusedski crushing Henman, corrects slug &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Carlos Moya, who had not won an indoor
match all year until this week, reached the semifinals of the ATP
Tour World Championship when he beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5 on
Friday.
	   Moya is usually not much of a threat on indoor courts and
prefers clay, the surface on which he won the French Open, and hard
courts.
	   Although indoors, the ATP championship is played on a hard court
and Moya has done well at this elite season-ending event, reaching
the semifinals for the second consecutive year.
	   By avenging his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last year, he
ousted the Russian from the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that
nominally brings the top eight players of the year.
	   ``I was perhaps luckier in important moments,'' Moya said. ``I
had to be like a wall, put back every ball. I was mentally stronger
than last year.''
	   Moya, No. 4 in the world, joined top-ranked Pete Sampras and Tim
Henman in the last four and will face Henman on Saturday.
	   Moya's first indoor victory of the season after five defeats
came at the start of the round-robin portion, when he beat Karol
Kucera. He lost to Sampras and finished behind him in one of the
four-man groups.
	   Greg Rusedski, an alternate who came in when Andre Agassi pulled
out with a back injury, crushed his fellow British teammate Henman
6-2, 6-4. He now has to wait for the outcome of the last match to
see if he's qualified.
	   If Alex Corretja beats fellow Spaniard Albert Costa, Corretja
will be the fourth semifinalist. A Costa victory would allow
Rusedski to go through.
	   Sampras had a day off and an opportunity to savor his historic
achievement _ holding to the No. 1 ranking for the sixth
consecutive year.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras
said after breaking the record he held jointly with Jimmy Connors.
	   There are new milestones to achieve as well: Sampras is one
title short of the 12 Grand Slam tournaments won by Roy Emerson.
	   And there is the French Open on clay, the only one Sampras
hasn't won. ``That's the biggest challenge,'' he said.
	   Staying No. 1 for six consecutive years, Sampras said, required
a lot of hard work.
	   ``It was well worth the sacrifice,'' he said just before
champagne was poured over his head at a little ceremony. He
returned the favor, showering ATP Tour chief Mark Miles and
promoter Ion Tiriac.
	   There was also a cake representing the figure six, with a
chocolate tennis ball inside the circle.
	   ``It's an ultimate achievement, it will probably never be
broken,'' he said. ``I'm trying to stay humble through all this,
but the record speaks for itself. It's a little overwhelming.''
	   Sampras was assured of the record when Marcelo Rios of Chile,
the only player with a chance to overtake him, pulled out of the
ATP championship because of a back injury. He was replaced by
Costa.
	   Rios trailed Sampras 33 points on the computer rankings.
	   Having won his first two round-robin matches, Sampras was
already assured a semifinal berth before he played Karol Kucera on
Thursday. A relaxed Sampras then demonstrated why he is No. 1,
crushing Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes.
	   Kucera is No. 7 and beat Sampras once in their three previous
matches this year.
	   If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the event in
1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   After Andre Agassi, Rios was the second player to pull out of
the tournament that nominally brings together the top eight players
of the year.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with reaction from UEFA, Turkish soccer president
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Galatasaray's Romanian strikers on Friday
assured Juventus players of their safety during next week's
Champions League match, while police prevented anti-Italian
protests to ease down tensions.
	   ``Don't be afraid, come Zidane,'' said two Romanian strikers of
Galatasaray, Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorge Hagi, in a joint
statement published by the daily sports newspaper, Fanatik. ``We
are your guarantee.''
	   Zidane and several other Juventus players have refused to play
the match in Turkey because of anti-Italian sentiment running high
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader,
Abdullah Ocalan.
	   ``We won't go to Istanbul. It's too risky,'' Zidane said. ``I
speak only for myself, but all of my teammates think the same way.
Galatasaray-Juventus should be played in a country other than
Turkey.''
	   UEFA already has moved the game originally slated for Wednesday,
to Dec. 2.
	   Reportedly Juventus was still seeking a neutral venue but
Turkish police seem determined to reduce the tension and blocked a
group of demonstrators from reaching the Italian consulate on
Thursday.
	   UEFA General-Secretary Gerhard Aigner said on Friday that UEFA
stood by its decision that the match should take place in Turkey
Dec. 2. After a meeting with Turkish soccer federation president
Haluk Ulusoy, Aigner said the Turkish side had given all the
guarantees necessary for the match to go ahead. He said UEFA would
await final reports from Turkish security and police, but that the
situation at the moment seemed satisfactory.
	   ``We don't mix sport and politics,'' said Ulusoy. ``We like
soccer and we guarantee the match will be held in fair play. As
president I will personally go to airport to welcome Juventus
players and spectators. On the ground we need sports and nothing
else but sports,'' he said.
	   Police had tolerated violent protests over the past week around
the country, where demonstrators set fire to a Fiat car, a
motorbike and numerous Italian flags and silk, Italian-made ties.
	   Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner has also invited his Italian
counterpart Giovanna Melandri to attend the match. It was not clear
if she would accept the invitation.
	   ``We two sports people should not allow terrorism, the common
enemy of our nations, to affect and tarnish the atmosphere of this
match,'' Seckiner said.
	   Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim challenged Juventus.
	   ``We will play at home,'' said Terim. ``But if this not happens,
we will topple them anywhere.''
	   Galatasaray has charged that the UEFA decision favored the
Italian team. Reports suggested that the decision by soccer's
European governing body allowed injured Juventus players time to
get back into shape.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.
	   Meantime Terim is expected to fly to Italy to watch Juventus,
which has reached the European Champions Cup final three straight
times and won once, against Bologna over the weekend.
	   Galatasaray's league match against Besiktas on Sunday has been
postponed by the soccer federation.
	   Italy objects to Ocalan's extradition as he faces death penalty
in Turkey for capital crimes.
	   Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12, is the leader of
the Kurdistan Workers Party which has been waging a guerrilla war
for autonomy in Turkey's southeast for 14 years. The conflict has
claimed nearly 37,000 lives.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Cook's statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A magistrate on Friday gave the government more
time to decide whether to go ahead with extradition proceedings for
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, or let the former Chilean leader go home.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw won an extra week, until Dec. 11, to
reach a decision.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson said
he would expect Pinochet to appear in court on that date, ``subject
to any medical reports.''
	   ``Obviously this is a decision which must be made and there must
be time given for proper consideration of all the representations.
It is in some respects quite a historic decision to make,''
Parkinson told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet.
	   Pinochet, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year
regime, remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he
is recovering from back surgery earlier this month.
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that
Pinochet could not claim immunity as a former head of state.
	   Chile's Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, whose government
has pressed for Pinochet's freedom, flew to London Friday to meet
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
	   ``I have explained to him and he understands this, that this is
a matter for the due legal process _ it's not a matter for
diplomatic negotiations,'' Cook told reporters before meeting his
Chilean counterpart.
	   Following an hour-long meeting, Cook issued a statement saying
he had assured Insulza ``neither the original arrest nor subsequent
steps had been politically motivated.''
	   ``We both expressed our shared commitment to maintaining good
relations between our two countries,'' Cook added.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's first post-communist
constitution was approved by an overwhelming majority of voters in
last weekend's referendum, official results showed Friday.
	   The constitution, which Western officials have said is necessary
to strengthen the Balkan nation's fragile democracy, will take
effect once the president signs a decree.
	   Approval had been all but guaranteed after the opposition,
locked in a power struggle with the government, urged a boycott of
the vote.
	   But the opposition Democratic Party rejected the results and
refused to acknowledge the new Constitution, and the opposition
members of the Central Voting Commission refused to endorse the
outcome.
	   Sali Berisha, the party's fiery leader, claimed that Albanians
had rejected the document and said the turnout was 39 percent. He
didn't say how he arrived at the figure.
	   ``If this were parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party
would have won two-thirds of the votes, '' said Berisha. He invited
Albanians to celebrate at a rally in Tirana on Saturday, Albania's
independence day.
	   But the Central Voting Commission's announcement that more than
half of registered voters participated is a good sign for the
government, which had feared that a low turnout would weaken its
hold on power and worsen the atmosphere of political uncertainty in
Albania.
	   The commission announced that 93 percent of those participating
voted to adopt the constitution, with a turnout of 50.57 percent.
	   The new constitution outlines civil, democratic and human rights
in the country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in
1991.
	   But it is unlikely to bring an end to the fierce political fight
between the ruling Socialists and the opposition Democrats.
	   The opposition complained about what it called ``grave
incidents'' at several polling stations, including beatings of its
commissioners. Foreign observers said they saw no such violence.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, accused officials of local
governments supportive of the Democratic Party of manipulating
voter lists by registering the dead and people no longer living in
those communities.
	   Foreign observers considered Sunday's vote an improvement over
last year's parliamentary elections, marred with violence and
irregularities.
	   Recent opposition rallies have not generated the intensity of
those in September that resulted in two days of rioting and forced
the ouster of the prime minister. Only 2,000 people showed up at
the last Democratic rally, earlier this week.

Chrysler Canada president dies while vacationing in Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, St. Thomas (AP) _ Chrysler Canada president
Bill Glaub has died while on vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands,
only seven months after taking the helm of Canada's third-biggest
carmaker.
	   Glaub, 49, apparently suffered a heart attack Thursday while on
a beach on the island of St. Thomas, said Eugene Woods, chief
executive of the Roy Lester Schneider Hospital, on Friday.
	   He said Glaub was seen struggling in a beach chair and was taken
to the hospital. But efforts to resuscitate him failed.
	   But Chrysler Canada said it appeared that Glaub died in a
boating accident while on his honeymoon with his wife Jan in the
Caribbean.
	   An autopsy to confirm the cause of death should be completed
later Friday, Woods said.
	   Glaub was named president and chief executive in April after his
predecessor, Yves Landry, died March 15 of a heart attack.
	   The Chicago-born Glaub joined Chrysler Corp. in 1971 and held a
number of executive posts with the U.S. company. He went to the
Canadian company in Windsor, Ontario, from Rochester Hills,
Michigan.
	   Glaub took over a company that had dlrs 16.7 billion in revenue
in 1997 and employed more than 16,000 people. Last year, it made
more than 600,000 vehicles, sold 256,162 cars and trucks through
dealers in Canada, and had net profits of dlrs 115 million.

Five years after serious violence, PSG fans return to Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ In the most bitter rivalry in French
soccer, Paris Saint-Germain visits Marseille on Sunday backed by
its own fans for the first time in five years.
	   PSG supporters have been prevented from attending matches in
Marseille since an infamous match on May 29 1993.
	   After Marseille won 3-1 to clinch the French title, PSG fans
threw fireworks onto the pitch and into tribunes packed with
Marseille fans. In the trouble that followed, dozens of spectators
and police were injured, and the violence spilled into downtown
Marseille, where calm was not restored until 2 am the following
morning.
	   On Sunday, 800 PSG supporters travel to the Stade Velodrome.
	   They will be escorted by more than 500 police.
	   PSG president Charles Bietry is seeking to play down the rivalry
between the two sets of fans.
	   ``We are going to Marseille to play a match of football, not to
make war,'' he said.
	   But officials and players recognize the importance of the match.
	   Marseille fans chanted anti-PSG slogans throughout most of last
Tuesday's at Monaco, said defender Patrick Blondeau.
	   ``On the bus and leaving the stadium, the supporters reminded us
of this match,'' he said.
	   All 60,000 match tickets have already been sold.
	   Form suggests a home win.
	   Marseille heads the French standings, having lost one of 20
league and cup games this season, while PSG has lurched from one
crisis to another recently, losing to minnow Maccabi Haifa in the
Cup Winners' Cup and sacking manager Alain Giresse in the process.
	   The Paris team has lost seven and drawn five of the last 12
meetings, and hasn't won at the Stade Velodrome since 1989.
	   PSG will be without dlrs 16 million buy Jay Jay Okocha, but
Marco Simone has recovered from injury and will play.
	   Marseille coach Rolland Courbis recalls defender Cyril Domoraud
and striker Fabrizio Ravanelli.

Report: Turkish border guards kill Armenian mistaken for Kurd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Turkish border guards killed an Armenian man
crossing the border after mistaking him for a Kurdish rebel about
to commit a suicide bombing, a news report said Friday.
	   Ashot Khachatryan, 22, was killed last week trying to cross into
Turkey on foot near the town of Pashatavan, a spokesman for
Armenia's Interior Ministry told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Armenian police said the Turkish border guards told them that
when they saw the man crossing the border with his hands behind his
back they took him for a Kurd about to set of a suicide bomb. The
report gave no more details about the reason for the confusion.
	   Turkish border guards handed over Khachatryan's body, which had
been shot in the chest, to Armenian border officers, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Armenia's Interior Ministry has launched an investigation.
	   Armenia and Turkey have a long history of animosity. Turkey has
accused Armenia of harboring Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting
for autonomy in Turkey since 1984 in a war that has killed 37,000
people.

Greece fears Turkey will build nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Friday said it was worried that
Turkey could build atomic bombs if it goes ahead with a plans to
build an nuclear plant on its Mediterranean coast.
	   Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told Parliament that Greece
was opposed to the plant at Akkuyu ``because of the technology that
has been chosen, and because of the valid suspicions that we have
that Turkey could possibly use the plant to begin the procedures
for the creation of nuclear weapons.''
	   Turkey has repeatedly denied it plans to use Akkuyu for weapons
purposes and is not even sure it if will build the plant.
	   Earlier this year Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos also
warned legislators here that Turkey was planning to use Akkuyu to
make atomic bombs.

 &UR; Samaranch worried about doping in North American pro-sport &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch expressed concern Friday about what he considers lax
anti-doping controls in North American professional sport.
	   While international sports federations endorsed a single Olympic
medical code Friday and all but three agreed to a package of
measures in a united front against doping in sport, the problem of
drugs in North American pro leagues remained a touchy _ and
unresolved _ issue.
	   Samaranch was asked why North American professional athletes can
remain untested throughout the year as long as they came up clean
in Olympic competition while others must undergo regular drug
tests.
	   ``I think the rules are clear: the athletes must be clean for
the Olympic Games,'' he said at a news conference. ``The
professional leagues do not belong to the Olympic movement, they
can do whatever they want. It is, however, a bad example for
youth.''
	   Quoted separately Friday in an interview in the French Sports
daily ``L'Equipe,'' Samaranch took a stronger stance.
	   ``It's impossible for us to intervene in the professional
leagues where doping is present everywhere,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``It's a big problem. It's an American problem with a
different mentality, different habits, and champions who boast
about taking banned substances and become national heros.''
	   That was a reference to baseball slugger Mark McGwire, who set a
single season home record with 70 homers. McGwire admitted using
the muscle-building supplement androstenedione, which is legal in
major league baseball but is listed as a banned steroid by the IOC.
	   Samaranch dismissed the possibility of refusing Olympic entry to
athletes from professional leagues which don't adhere to the IOC
anti-doping agreement.
	   ``Maybe we have to consider again, but I think bit by bit, step
by step all the sports organizations will be at the same level,''
Samaranch told The Associated Press. ``But regarding things in the
United States, before taking any kind of decision we would like to
speak with the United States Olympic Committee.''
	   Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey
Federation, also showed a certain leniency towards the professional
players.
	   ``That's the way things are and it's difficult to change them,''
said Fasel. ``I've discussed it with Bob Goodenow (executive
director of the NHL Players Association), and also with certain
players who argue `I earn dlrs 10 million a year, I've injured my
knee and my boss wants me to play next Tuesday. I have to do what's
necessary to heal in time.'
	   ``It's two separate worlds,'' Fasel said. ``But it's clear that
as long as the pros participate in the Games they will have to
undergo testing and abide by our rules.''
	   The IIHF president said an exchange with the NHL's Players
Association to reach a compromise would be necessary in the near
future.
	   ``It's true our sport does have cases of anabolic steroid and
growth hormone abuse and we want to fight against it,'' said Fasel.
``With a lot of dialogue, we'll try to find a way so the NHL
protects itself a bit.
	   ``It might take a serious accident for the heads of the NHL
decide to better control doping.''

Saga Petroleum to sell Visund field stake to Gaz de France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Saga Petroleum ASA on Friday announced an
agreement to sell its 4.2 percent interest in the Norwegian Visund
oil field in the North Sea to Gaz de France for 530 million kroner
(dlrs 70.6 million).
	   Privately-owned Saga, Norway's third-largest oil company, said
the deal with French utility will be retroactive to July 1, pending
approval by the French and Norwegian governments.
	   Visund is about 160 kilometers (105 miles) off Bergen, the
largest city on Norway's west coast. Field reservoirs contain an
estimated 48.4 million cubic meters (305 million barrels) of oil
and 50 billion cubic meters (176 billion cubic feet) of natural
gas.
	   The field is operated by the Oslo-based Norsk Hydro ASA concern,
and is due to begin production in April or May 1999.

Faeroe Islands' fisheries minister convicted of raping teen-age

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The Faeroe Islands' fisheries
minister was sentenced to 10 months' jail on Friday after he was
convicted of raping a teen-age girl.
	   During his trial in the Faeroes' capital of Torshavn, John
Petersen, 50, admitted having sex with a then 17-year-old girl when
she was living in his house three years ago. However, he claimed
she consented, and insisted in court that he was not guilty of
rape.
	   It was not immediately known whether Petersen, who was on leave
pending a verdict, would step down from his government post. He
immediately appealed to a higher court in Denmark.
	   Petersen is a member of Faeroes' Premier Anfinn Kallsberg's
conservative Folkaflokkurin party. This year, he began his second
term as fisheries minister, a key government post because fish make
up 97 percent of the islands' exports.
	   The court also ordered Petersen to pay 30,000 kroner (dlrs
4,840) in damages to the young women, whose name was withheld by
Faeroese authorities.
	   The Faeroes, an 18-island archipelago midway between Iceland and
Scotland, are Danish territory but have substantial home rule.

Russian government to cut taxes, hoping to improve compliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with estimates of budget deficit, plans to
force exporters sell 75 percent of foreign-currency revenues for
rubles, other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government announced plans Friday to cut
taxes, part of its overall strategy of improving tax collections
and pumping some life into the country's moribund economy.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told government officials that
the value-added tax would be cut from 20 percent to 14 percent in
1999, and the profit tax would be cut from 35 percent to 30
percent.
	   ``These measures help expand the base for taxation,'' the
premier said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. He added that
the VAT cut should be especially popular, since it will lower the
cost of electricity and other consumer expenses.
	   The tax cuts will serve as a foundation for the government's
proposed 1999 budget, Primakov said. He said the government plans
to cut the VAT further to 10 percent in 2000.
	   Tax collection has been a major problem for the Russian
government, and critics have long said the government encouraged
tax cheating by setting its rates too high. As a result, the
government has lacked money to pay wages, provide services and
repay its debts.
	   If passed early next year, the measures may help increase
Russia's gross domestic product in the second half of 1999, and may
slow the decline in Russia's oil exports _ the country's main
revenue earner _ tax chief Georgy Boos told a news conference
Friday.
	   Next year's draft budget assumes a deficit of 94.9 billion
rubles (dlrs 5.5 billion), the Interfax news agency reported
Friday, citing the Finance Ministry. The government has given no
word on how it plans to fill the gap, and no loans from foreign
creditors are expected any time soon.
	   The International Monetary Fund froze a dlrs 22.6 billion aid
package for Russia after the country defaulted on its treasury debt
in August. The IMF does not plan to resume aide before Russia
begins implementing a sound economic plan.
	   Some economists have said Russia's short-sighted tax policy
helped set in motion the cash crunch that led to the August default
and ruble devaluation. Those actions set off a banking crisis that
plunged the country into economic turmoil.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said Friday that the
federal budget deficit will total 17.5 billion rubles (just over
dlrs 1 billion) in October through December this year. He was
speaking in Vienna, Austria.
	   The Central Bank is also pushing to require Russian exporters to
sell 75 percent of their foreign-currency earnings to the bank for
rubles _ up from the current 50 percent, Gerashchenko said. The
plan has been criticized by the Russian media as a move toward
Soviet-style currency controls.
	   ITAR-Tass reported Friday that Gerashchenko will also head a
recently established agency for restructuring the country's ailing
banks.
	   The state-controlled Agency for Restructuring Credit
Organizations will issue stabilization credits and take over stakes
in commercial banks that are scheduled for restructuring.
	   It will also oversee liquidation of troubled banks that won't
qualify for restructuring.
	   Most Russian banks have been on the brink of bankruptcy or faced
severe liquidity problems since August.

West Indians begin tightening play against South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results at end of play &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies team started
tightening its play Friday afternoon during its first test against
South Africa, restricting the home team's first innings to 217 for
six at the close of play.
	   Earlier, the West Indies had been dismissed for 261 in their
first innings at Wanderers Stadium, adding just 12 runs to their
overnight score while losing their last three wickets.
	   As the West Indies clawed their way back into the match during
second day of the test, Courtney Walsh became the leading West
Indian wicket taker as he claimed the scalp of Jacques Kallis for
53 in his second wicket of the innings. He moved to 376 test
wickets to pass Malcolm Marshall, and ended the day with another
two wickets, getting Darryl Cullinan caught down the leg side for
eight. Shaun Pollock bowled off a bottom edge for 11.
	   Kallis and Gary Kirsten rebuilt the innings with a fine
partnership of 92, and then the innings stuttered with the fall of
Kallis and Cullinan. When Kirsten (62) and Jonty Rhodes fell in
quick succession to Nixon McLean, the tourists had pulled the match
back into equilibrium, having lost the initiative on the first day
after winning the toss.
	   With Walsh and Curtly Ambrose bowling very tightly with good
support from McLean and the pitch playing increasingly unevenly,
South Africa has a lot of work to do to overhaul the West Indies
score.
	   While South African captain Hansie Cronje is at the wicket with
the depleted West Indies bowling attack, a substantial first
innings lead is still on the cards.
	   Play resumes Saturday at 10.00 a.m. (0800 GMT).

Western hostages probably killed, says top Indian security
</HEADLINE>
official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Four Westerners kidnapped in India's
troubled Kashmir state three years ago appear to have been killed,
Press Trust of India news agency quoted an Indian paramilitary
force chief as saying Friday.
	   ``I think they have been killed long time back,'' E.N. Rammohan,
chief of India's paramilitary Border Security Force, told reporters
in New Delhi.
	   This was the first time that a top Indian official has spoken
about the possibility of the hostages being killed. Until now,
government officials have said there has been no contact for more
than two years with the abductors or those kidnapped _ Donald
Hutchings of Spokane, Washington, Dirk Hasert of Erfurt, Germany,
Keith Mangan of Middlesborough, England and Paul Wells of London.
	   A little known Pakistan-based separatist group, Al Faran,
claimed responsibility for the abductions of Western tourists in
1995 and demanded the release of 21 Muslim guerrilla leaders in
exchange for the hostages.The Indian government refused, saying
that accepting such a demand would encourage more kidnappings.
	   Another American, John Childs of Simsbury, Connecticut, escaped
his captors within days of the abduction in 1995, but Norwegian
Hans Christian Ostro's beheaded body was found a month later.
	   Last year, some captured militants told Indian security forces
that that the four hostages were killed in December 1995 or January
1996. But no bodies have been found.
	   Relatives and friends of the hostages have visited Srinagar, the
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, several times since 1995 to seek
their release.
	   India accuses neighboring Pakistan of arming and training
separatists. Pakistan says it provides diplomatic and moral support
to the Kashmiri rebels.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Himalayan
territory, which now lies divided between them. Both countries
claim all of Kashmir.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Friday began
compiling its first all-race voter list, but confusion marred the
day and even President Nelson Mandela registered at the wrong site.
	   South Africans lined up at schools, churches and other sites to
register for the 1999 election, the first since the 1994 all-race
balloting which marked the end of apartheid.
	   In Soweto, a sprawling black township and the scene of frequent
uprisings against white rule, about 50 men and women sat quietly in
a classroom at a run-down school with broken windows, awaiting
their turn to register. Some waited as long as six hours.
	   As a woman with a baby bound to her back by a blanket stood up
to register, one man murmured: ``We don't mind waiting. For us, it
is important to vote.''
	   There was less patience in a community center in the integrated,
run-down Johannesburg neighborhood of Yeoville, where dozens of
people were turned away after being told they were in the wrong
place.
	   It was only on Friday that many of the 12.7 million potential
voters in the northern section of the country learned which
registration site they should go to. Instructions were often vague
and many sites didn't open because civil servants who were supposed
to staff them failed to appear. The southern half of the country
registers on Dec. 4-6.
	   Opposition parties blasted the government.
	   ``The chaotic start of the registration process poses a serious
threat to a free and fair election,'' said the National Party,
which ruled during apartheid.
	   Mandela went to an elementary school in Johannesburg and duly
registered in front of photographers, but later was told the
Independent Electoral Commission had directed him to the wrong
place, said Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African National
Congress. Mandela would register again ``at his earliest possible
convenience,'' Masebe said.
	   Others were more bitter about the foul-ups.
	   ``I'm so sick of the muddle and disorganization of the bloody
ANC government,'' complained Barbara Durlacher, a 65-year-old white
who was told she was at the wrong site.
	   Mandela, however, beckoned whites to join the ANC and abandon
the National Party that ruled during apartheid and turned South
Africa into ``the world's polecat.''
	   He told a Foreign Correspondents Association dinner Thursday
night that the ANC needed a two-thirds majority in parliament ``to
ensure that we are not interfered with by Mickey Mouse parties who
have no commitment to democracy.'' The majority would allow the
party to independently pass legislation.
	   Election officials, soldiers and civil servants including
teachers and secretaries helped people register. Among problems
Friday:
	   _The IEC failed to set up registration stations for nearly
10,000 potential voters in areas of North West Province, the ANC
charged.
	   _The school where Mandela was supposed to have registered was
one of about 50 registration points in eastern Johannesburg which
did not open because personnel failed to arrive.
	   IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler acknowledged the problems.
	   ``It's an immensely complicated exercise,'' he said. ``We'll
patch it up. We'll make it good before we're finished with it.''
	   Elections are likely to take place next May. No date has been
set.

Kremlin says heart history `taking toll' on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

reference to unusual candor by Kremlin. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A history of repeated heart attacks is ``taking
its toll'' on Russian President Boris Yeltsin, his spokesman
acknowledged Friday in some of the frankest language ever used by
the Kremlin about an incumbent leader.
	   It was the first time that a Yeltsin aide had even admitted
openly that the president had suffered a heart attack, much less
that it had compromised his health.
	   Doctors have long said that Yeltsin suffered a heart attack
during his 1996 re-election campaign, and Russian media have
reported that he has had as many as five. But Kremlin aides have
gone to great lengths to portray Yeltsin's health in the best
possible light.
	   That seemed to change Friday with the remarks by spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin at a news conference.
	   ``In 1996, the president was working through several heart
attacks while carrying out a very active election campaign,''
Yakushkin said.
	   The past ailments, combined with the ``emotional, physical and
psychological pressure endured by the president are taking its
toll,'' and make it harder for Yeltsin to overcome routine
illnesses, such as the flu, Yakushkin said.
	   Doctors and Yeltsin aides previously made a point of saying that
the frequent illnesses suffered by the 67-year old leader in the
past two years were unrelated to his heart condition.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized since Sunday, undergoing treatment
for pneumonia, the latest in a series of ailments that have raised
concerns about his ability to serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin's temperature was normal and his
condition ``satisfactory'' on Friday. But he said doctors had told
the president to stay in bed.
	   ``He's partly bed-ridden, that means he spends some time in bed,
but also moves around his room and works at the table,'' Yakushkin
said, adding that the ``president's activity has increased.''
	   ``He had several telephone conversations and considered several
important documents,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Doctors banned Yeltsin from seeing visitors, fearing they may
infect him with a flu virus going around the Russian capital,
Yakushkin said.
	   The spokesman did not comment on when Yeltsin was expected to
leave the hospital.
	   Both Yakushkin and Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg
Sysuyev continued to insist that the president was capable of
performing his duties until the end of his term.
	   Sysuyev dismissed suggestions that early presidential elections
should be held, saying that would destabilize the nation.
	   In recent weeks, several prominent Yeltsin supporters have
joined his opposition in urging him to step down early.
	   Yeltsin has rarely appeared in public in recent months, and has
said little about the country's economic crisis, the worst in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Yeltsin continues to support Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov but
recently urged his Cabinet to work faster to deal with the crisis,
Yakushkin said in an interview with Izvestia.
	   Primakov announce plans Friday to cut value-added tax and profit
taxes, part of the government's overall strategy of improving tax
collections and pumping some life into the moribund economy.

Guinea-Bissau parliament calls on president to resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's parliament on Friday
called on President Joao Bernardo Vieira to resign immediately,
according to reports.
	   The National Popular Assembly, the small West African country's
parliament, voted 69-0, with nine abstentions, for a bill stating
that lawmakers had ``no political confidence'' in Vieira, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The decision further isolates Vieira who earlier this month was
forced to sign a peace deal with a breakaway army faction to end a
five-month civil war in the former Portuguese colony of 1 million
people.
	   A Nigerian-led regional force is due to arrive later this month
to oversee implementation of the pact that calls for a national
unity government, including rebel representatives, and presidential
elections no later than March.
	   The rebels, who accused Vieira of corruption and demanded that
he step down, overran most of the small country, despite the
backing Vieira received from troops sent by neighboring Senegal and
Republic of Guinea.

Pope: Christianity's 2,000th year time for penance, forgiveness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Calling Christianity's 2,000th anniversary a
year of mercy, new decrees from Pope John Paul II offer the
faithful opportunity for forgiveness _ and say the church will seek
forgiveness as well.
	   John Paul's papal bull, being issued Sunday, upholds a
700-year-old tradition of celebrating church anniversary years, or
Jubilees, by offering ``indulgences'' _ acts of penance through
which the faithful can win forgiveness of sins.
	   For individuals, John Paul says, the penance can be as simple as
giving up smoking for a day.
	   Expanding the tradition, the pope also is inviting such acts of
atonement by nations, in the form of forgiving Third World debt,
and by the church and its clerics.
	   ``As a successor of Peter, I ask that in this year of mercy the
church, strong in the holiness that she receives from her Lord,
should kneel before God and implore forgiveness for the past and
present sins of her sons and daughters,'' John Paul writes.
	   Papal bulls are edicts of the popes, the solemnity of which are
emphasized by the use of fine paper and lead seals.
	   The Vatican released copies of the bull on Friday.
	   John Paul wants the church to enter the third millennium with a
clear conscience. He has expressed regret for some past actions of
Catholics, including the church's overall failure to do more to
help Jews against the Nazis.
	   Jewish groups and others have urged a specific recounting of
church wrongs.
	   After calling for Catholics' ``humble recognition of our
faults,'' John Paul's edict pointedly adds, ``At the same time,
there will be no lack of fair-minded people able to recognize that
past and present history also records incidents of exclusion,
injustice and persecution directed against the sons and daughters
of the church.''
	   ``May the joy of forgiveness be greater than any resentment,''
he says.
	   The papal bull also addresses Israel's claim to the entire city
of Jerusalem, a claim that the Vatican does not recognize. Church
leaders want the city's holy sites of all faiths protected by
international statute.
	   ``May the Jubilee serve to advance mutual dialogue until the day
when all of us together _ Jews, Christians and Muslims _ will
exchange the greeting of peace in Jerusalem.''
	   For individuals, the bull outlines acts of penance as simple as
volunteer work for charities, or giving up ``superfluous
consumption'' such as smoking or drinking.
	   Jubilee indulgences are a tradition going back to Pope Boniface
VIII, who marked 1300 by offering ``abundant remission and pardon
of sins'' to those who made pilgrimages to St. Peter's Basilica
that year.
	   Strapped for cash, the medieval church increasingly resorted to
taking money for indulgences _ Martin Luther's top complaints among
the famous 95 theses he nailed to a church door in Germany in 1517.
	   Excommunicated for his dissent, Luther founded Protestantism.

Annan calls on Congo to choose `peace' and `compromise'

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday called
on African leaders - especially those at war in Congo - to renounce
violence and accept compromise in the quest for peace on the
strife-torn continent.
	   Speaking at a summit of African leaders in Paris, Annan said
many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance''
and that war in Congo poses the greatest challenge for the
continent.
	   ``In the Congo, as everywhere, what is needed is for all parties
irrevocably to choose peace and compromise, turning their backs on
violence and conflict,'' Annan said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, for his part, urged African
nations to do their own peacekeeping - a departure from past
practices that put the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders are focusing on
security issues.
	   But as the summit got underway, all eyes were on Congolese
President Laurent-Desire Kabila, who crosses paths here with
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's
leader. Both Rwanda and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency
in the Congo.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention in
the wake of the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   But French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by the French
Human Rights League and the International Federation of Human
Rights Leagues, ruled Friday that Kabila cannot be pursued for
human rights violations because he benefits from the customary
immunity accorded to exercising heads of state.
	   Though concrete solutions to the Congo crisis were unlikely to
emerge from the summit, participants said they hoped for progress.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
Friday he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo ``during
the month of December.''
	   And the Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared to meet
with Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila has not been optimistic, saying a pullout of Rwandan
and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition for
substantive talks on a peace settlement.
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France
Internationale, Kabila added that his allies, Angola and Zimbabwe,
``were not pushing (him) to negotiate.''
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks with French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday.
	   The French president stressed the need for Africans to take more
responsibility for settling conflicts.
	   ``Instability is not Africa's fate. It is of course a matter of
responsibility for Africans themselves,'' Chirac said.
	   ``The reality at the end of 1998 is that a quarter of
sub-Saharan African states are in crisis,'' he said, ``in most
cases, spilling over national borders.''
	   Chirac called on African nations to move forward with plans for
regional security structures, but added this would not imply an
``erosion of responsibilities'' by the United Nations or the
international community.
	   Organization of African Unity chairman Blaise Campaore of
Burkina Faso agreed that Africans must take responsibility for
their own security.
	   But the international community ``has the duty of supporting
African peace initiatives,'' as well as providing technical,
logistical and financial support, Campaore said.

Germany submits bid to FIFA president

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to European lines to CORRECT category coding. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Less than a day after reiterating his
support for South Africa's bid to host the 2006 World Cup, FIFA
President Sepp Blatter said Friday that Germany was a ``very strong
candidate.''
	   German federation (DFB) vice president Franz Beckenbauer
submitted a formal notification of his country's interest,
personally handing to Blatter a letter at FIFA headquarters in
Zurich.
	   England, Brazil, Egypt and Ghana also have informed FIFA
officially that they want the finals.
	   Prospective candidates have until Dec. 31 to signal their intent
and until the end of July to submit their full bid documents.
FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   ``FIFA is very appreciative of the immense global interest being
shown in the staging of its most prestigious competition,
especially in Germany,'' Blatter said in a statement.
	   ``I am certain that the German FA will, in customary fashion,
prove to be a very strong candidate.''
	   But Blatter has long made it clear that he wants the finals to
be awarded to South Africa.
	   At a ceremony in Johannesburg on Thursday, he went further than
usual by declaring that FIFA had a ``responsibility'' to make sure
the tournament takes place in Africa.
	   ``I am fighting for the World Cup of 2006 to come to Africa,''
Blatter told reporters.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are both from the same continent. The 2002 finals
are being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA has said
co-hosting would be a one-time exception.

Daughter of slain Chilean general testifies in Pinochet case
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The daughter of slain Chilean general
Friday told the Spanish judge seeking to extradite Augusto Pinochet
that her father was killed after complaining that the former
dictator's regime was cracking down too hard on opponents.
	   Olga Lutz said her father, Gen. Augusto Lutz, and other generals
met with Pinochet in September 1974, a year after his coup, and
expressed concerned about the abuses committed by the secret
police, or DINA.
	   Lutz testified that Pinochet angrily told the generals: ``I am
the DINA,'' to put an end to the discussion.
	   Gen. Lutz was killed, allegedly under Pinochet's orders, soon
after the meeting and other high ranking officers were forced into
retirement, Lutz's lawyer Joan Garces said.
	   Lutz, who resides in Brussels, and Garces spoke briefly to
reporters as they came out of Judge Baltasar Garzon's office _ the
nerve center of the probe to get Pinochet extradited from Britain
on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
	   The investigation, begun in 1996, has collected evidence from
victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship during which over
3,000 people were killed or disappeared.
	   Lutz's testimony appeared to back allegations by Pinochet
opponents that the dictator was directly responsible for what went
on.
	   ``This testimony is key information regarding what was going on
among the general's after the coup,'' Garces said.
	   Lutz's father was chief of army intelligence at the time of the
coup, and named secretary to the ruling military junta two months
later.
	   His daughter also told Garzon about a meeting in June 1974 when
the worried generals pressed for guarantees of a return to
democracy within three years and urged Pinochet not to unilaterally
declare himself head of state.
	   Pinochet, whose regime lasted 17 years, was arrested at Garzon's
instigation in London while recovering from back surgery on Oct.
16.
	   Britain's highest court ruled on Wednesday that the former
despot does not have immunity and on Friday Home Secretary Jack
Straw was given until Dec. 11 to decide whether to allow
extradition proceedings to start.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Back on their home ice, Russians swept the podium
Friday in the women's event at the Cup of Russia.
	   Yelena Sokolova secured her lead after the short program to win
her second event this year. Two weeks earlier she won the Nations
Cup in Germany.
	   The 18-year-old Sokolova, a rising star in Russian skating
ranks, performed to a blues number and nailed her triple
lutz-double toe loop combination and triple loop jumps. Sokolova is
the only Russian skater to fulfill a triple-triple combination this
year.
	   Julia Soldatova was in second after Friday's skating at the Cup
of Russia, the fifth event in the International Skating Union's
Grand Prix, which features Olympic-eligible skaters and is being
held in Moscow for the first time.
	   Irina Slutskaya, 19, the 1995 world junior champion and second
to Michelle Kwan in the 1998 World Championship, dropped to third.
Japan's Yuka Kanazawa placed fourth, Laetitia Hubert of France was
fifth and Anna Rechnio of Poland was sixth.
	   ``We have achieved a new level of women skating in Russia now,''
renowned Russian coach Yelena Chaikovskaya.
	   ``There are new Olympic champions sitting here in front of
you,'' she said.
	   The Cup concludes Saturday with free skating in the men's
competition, as well as the free dance.
	   Winners receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can accumulate points from
two of the meets to qualify for the series final in St. Petersburg,
Russia, in March. The next event is NHK Trophy in Sapporo, Japan,
in December.

Olivia de Havilland gets honorary doctorate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. ALBANS, England (AP) _ She was one of the oldest
degree-winners, and probably the most glamorous.
	   Screen star Olivia de Havilland, 82, accepted an honorary
doctorate Friday from the University of Hertfordshire at graduation
ceremonies in the Abbey and Cathedral Church of St. Alban on
Friday.
	   ``You can't imagine how much it means to me to be here in this
historic cathedral and to be receiving from the University of
Hertfordshire the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters,'' she told
300 graduates, who crowded into the church with family and friends.
``For both the cathedral and the university are of special
significance to my English family, and my English family is of
special significance to me.''
	   Her cousin, Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, founded the de Havilland
aviation company, a predecessor of British Aerospace, and the
university campus in nearby Hatfield was built on land formerly
owned by the company.
	   ``When I think of all the young people here who will shortly be
receiving their degrees, I wish them three things _ courage, work
that they love and a passion for excellence,'' she said.
	   Miss de Havilland, who won Academy Awards in 1946 and 1949, now
lives in Paris.

Police seek 25-year-old Colombian in killing of U.S. agent

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Police have identified a 25-year-old
unemployed Colombian as a suspect in the slaying of a U.S. drug
agent shot through the chest during an argument outside a Bogota
discotheque.
	   Jorge Figueroa Monroy, 25, was described by witnesses as the man
who shot and killed Frank Arnold Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, early
Sunday before fleeing on a motorcycle, said Colombian police
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   They said the suspect, from a well-to-do Bogota family, was in
hiding.
	   An autopsy of the 37-year-old Drug Enforcement Administration
agent found a small amount of alcohol and no drugs in his body, the
sources said.
	   Figueroa was described by police as an unemployed regular in the
Zona Rosa entertainment district of bars and restaurants where
Moreno was killed. Authorities said they did not know exactly what
words were exchanged between the two men before the shooting or
whether Figueroa knew the victim was a DEA agent.
	   U.S. officials have said that Moreno's death was unrelated to
his job, although Colombian police said members of Figueroa's
family were being investigated for alleged money laundering.
	   A 20-year-old Colombian wounded in the neck during Sunday's
shooting died the following day. Police said it appeared that
Figueroa only fired one shot, and the bullet probably ricocheted.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Despite agreements by two far-right
parties not to compete against each other in local elections, the
extremist Republican party on Friday denied formal cooperation with
the German People's Union.
	   At best there is ``the understanding of growing readiness to
bundle our own strengths,'' said Johann Gaertner, the party's
deputy chairman.
	   Both parties, which have similar anti-foreigner policies and
slogans, did poorly in Sept. 27 national elections.
	   The DVU said this week that it would not run in the Hesse state
elections on Feb. 1 and that the Republicans had agreed not to run
in Bremen elections in June ``to avoid unnecessary competition.''

U.S. envoy says Kosovo peace process entering critical stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid signs of a diplomatic push in
Kosovo, the U.S. envoy said Friday peace process was entering a
critical stage and the top ethnic Albanian leader signaled
political negotiations would start soon.
	   Christopher Hill, the American diplomat trying to hammer out a
peace deal for Kosovo, said the U.S.-led peace efforts have picked
up speed and expressed hope they would lead to a basic solution in
foreseeable future.
	   ``I do believe we are getting to another critical moment,'' said
Hill after talks with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
provincial capital Pristina. ``The pace has really picked up.''
	   ``I see no reason why one should want to wait till the spring in
order to get a political solution,'' he added. ``The time for that
is as soon as possible and I would hope that we can do it well
before than.''
	   There have been fears that Kosovo could explode in a new round
of fighting if the solution is not reached by the time the snow
melts. Clashes earlier this year claimed hundreds of lives and
forced more than 300,000 people from their homes.
	   According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
175,000 homeless people are staying with friends or relatives,
while nearly 100,000 are sheltered in other parts of Yugoslavia and
its neighboring countries. About 65,000 people have fled the
region.
	   Hill has been trying to get the Serb government and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo agree to a draft plan for the province so they
could meet and further advance political negotiations.
	   In another sign that a diplomatic breakthrough could be in
sight, Rugova said Friday that ``we are not far from political
negotiations.''
	   Hill's plan keeps Kosovo only loosely tied to Serbia, while
moving the jurisdiction over the province to the level of Yugoslav
federation, which also includes Montenegro. The draft has been
criticized by Serbia and only cautiously greeted by
independence-minded Albanians.
	   The government earlier this week came up with a counter-plan
keeping the southern province firmly within Serbia. Hill said the
Serb plan provided ``some useful suggestions,'' which the U.S.
diplomats would try to incorporate into their version.
	   ``I think we are going to work some more on our draft and hope
that we can get the people to agree to it so that we can move
ahead,'' he said. He plans to return to Kosovo next week with the
reworked draft.
	   Hill has discussed his plan with ethnic Albanian rebels, whose
support is crucial.
	   Meanwhile, in a step hailed by a Western official as a ``small
but very important gesture,'' ethnic Albanian rebels freed two
journalists from the Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted
Oct. 18. Western diplomats helped negotiate the two men's release.
	   The KLA said it had abducted the journalists after they drove
into rebel-held territory.
	   In a meeting with Hill, Yugoslav deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic
warned ``energetic'' action against ethnic Albanian militants
unless they stop ``kidnapping and threatening lives'' in Kosovo.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.

Netanyahu cuts short trip to Europe over escalating Lebanon crisis

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
promised a thorough review of Israel's policy in Lebanon, saying he
cut short a trip to Europe and returned home to ``make decisions.''
	   However, Netanyahu also said he would only pull Israeli troops
out of southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to
attacks by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   With Hezbollah unwilling to give such guarantees, it is unlikely
Israeli troops will redeploy any time soon.
	   Hezbollah commander Sheik Nabil Kaouk warned Friday that ``any
adventure by the Israeli occupiers to try and change the status quo
in south Lebanon will serve to increase its losses.'' Karouk's
remarks appeared to offer little encouragement that an Israeli
troop withdrawal would quickly end the conflict.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The daughter of a slain Chilean general
told the Spanish judge seeking to extradite Augusto Pinochet that
her father was killed after complaining that the then-dictator was
cracking down too hard on opponents.
	   Olga Lutz said Friday that her father, Gen. Augusto Lutz, and
other generals met with Pinochet in September 1974, a year after he
took power in a coup, and expressed concerned about the abuses
committed by the secret police, or DINA.
	   Olga Lutz testified that Pinochet angrily told the generals: ``I
am the DINA,'' to put an end to the discussion.
	   Lutz was killed, allegedly on Pinochet's orders, soon after the
meeting, and other high-ranking officers were forced into
retirement, said Olga Lutz's lawyer, Joan Garces.
	   Olga Lutz, who lives in Brussels, and Garces spoke briefly to
reporters as they came out of Judge Baltasar Garzon's office _ the
nerve center of the probe to get Pinochet extradited from Britain
to face charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
	   The investigation, begun in 1996, has collected evidence from
victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship, during which, the
Chilean government says, more than 3,000 people were killed or
disappeared.
	   Olga Lutz's testimony appeared to back allegations by Pinochet
opponents that the dictator was directly responsible for what went
on.
	   ``This testimony is key information regarding what was going on
among the generals after the coup,'' Garces said.
	   Lutz's father was chief of army intelligence at the time of the
coup, and named secretary to the ruling military junta two months
later.
	   His daughter also told Garzon about a meeting in June 1974 when
the worried generals pressed for guarantees of a return to
democracy within three years and urged Pinochet not to unilaterally
declare himself head of state.
	   Pinochet, whose regime lasted 17 years, was arrested at Garzon's
instigation in London while recovering from back surgery on Oct.
16.
	   Britain's highest court ruled on Wednesday that the former
despot does not have immunity and on Friday, British Home Secretary
Jack Straw was given until Dec. 11 to decide whether to allow
extradition proceedings to start.

Jail uprising leaves three dead in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Prisoners seized control of an
overcrowded police jail in an eight-hour rebellion that left three
inmates dead, Brazilian police said Friday.
	   The uprising followed a foiled escape attempt at the First
Precinct station in Diadema, a poor industrial suburb of Sao Paulo,
police chief Mikiaki Yamamoto said.
	   Three prisoners were stabbed to death with homemade knives,
apparently in a settling of scores among inmates, he said. TV
footage showed prisoners with improvised masks milling around the
body of a victim lying in the yard.
	   The uprising ended when a judge agreed to transfer 20 prisoners,
Yamamoto said.
	   The Diadema jail was built to hold 60 prisoners but housed 209.
Overcrowding in Brazilian prisons is chronic and often breeds
violence, including 195 jail rebellions last year in the state of
Sao Paulo alone.
	   This week, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed a bill
allowing some nonviolent criminals to do community service or pay a
penalty instead of going to jail. The measure is expected to reduce
overcrowding.

Mexican towns shaken by volcano
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Residents of towns near the Popocatepetl
volcano on the outskirts of Mexico City were roused from their beds
by an explosive emission of red-hot rock, civil defense officials
reported.
	   The brief eruption late Thursday tossed glowing rock as far as 2
miles (3 kilometers) from the crater and sent out a shock wave felt
in towns 10 miles (15 kms) or more from the peak, whose name means
``Smoking Mountain'' in the Aztec Indian language.
	   ``It caused a lot of concern, since the blast was felt in towns
and villages relatively far from the crater,'' Mexico state Civil
Defense director Pedro Sesin said Friday.
	   Television footage showed families sitting outside their homes
shivering in the night air Thursday, nervously watching the
volcano.
	   ``The explosion was very intense but brief. It threw
incandescent rock from two to three kilometers (one to two miles)
from the crater,'' said Roberto Meli, director of the National
Center for the Prevention of Disasters. ``It illuminated the peak
for several moments in a red glow.''
	   Several villages near the crater got a light dusting of volcanic
ash, Sesin said. While a new plume of ash, gases and water vapor
rose from the volcano Friday, experts said it had a relatively low
ash content.
	   Experts are worried about the apparently large column of lava
building inside the 18,000-foot (5,490-meter) volcano only 50 miles
(80 kms) southeast of Mexico City.
	   ``We can't say whether the volcano has released its pressure,
since there is apparently a very large amount of magma'' inside,
Meli said.
	   While the most likely outcome is another series of gas emissions
or explosions, Meli estimates there is a 1-in-10 chance that the
volcano could erupt in lava flows.
	   There is also a remote possibility that a much larger explosion
could destroy part of the peak, Meli said.
	   About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slope and another 15
million live within 50 miles (80 kms) of it. The volcano has been
active since 1994, regularly emitting gas and steam.

European stock exchange heads meet on creating united market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with heads of eight stock exchanges expressing support
for formation of pan-European market, creation of stock alliance
committee, Stockholm lone holdout.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The heads of eight of Europe's most powerful stock
exchanges expressed support Friday for the creation of a
pan-European market, the company that runs France's stock market
said.
	   The Societe des Bourses Francaises, the SBF, which was hosting a
meeting of European stock exchange leaders in Paris, also said that
a stock alliance committee had been formed to advance the process
of creating a single European stock market.
	   ``The heads of the exchanges agreed on an agenda of further
meetings and expressed their strong commitment for the continuation
of the collective progress through the creation of an exchange
alliance committee,'' a statement by the SBF said.
	   The Paris meeting came four months after the Frankfurt and
London exchanges had announced plans for the creation of an
Anglo-German market.
	   The French criticized the Anglo-German plan at the time, but
since then Paris has been seeking a way to get in on the proposed
alliance between Frankfurt and London.
	   At Friday's meeting, only the Stockholm exchange declined to
join the stock alliance committee, a decision that was not a
surprise.
	   Even before the Paris gathering, OM Gruppen AB, which owns the
Stockholm exchange had expressed skepticism about the new
pan-European exchange, saying its profit-based corporate structure
would not be compatible with the proposed European trading floor.
	   ``The first meeting was very constructive and sets a good basis
for further progress toward the common objective of creating an
efficient and accessible pan-European market,'' the SBF statement
said.
	   In recent months, Paris and the smaller European exchanges have
realized that they will be left out if they don't join the movement
toward one big European market. The new European currency, the
euro, which begins Jan. 1, 1999, has also been a major impetus
toward the creation of a pan-European market.
	   The talks Friday were attended by the heads of the exchanges of
Paris, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid,
Stockholm and Zurich.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, at a briefing on
Thursday, told reporters that the Paris Bourse, as the stock
exchange here is known, will be joining the London-Frankfurt
alliance that had been a thorn in France's side.
	   A new European stock-market company could emerge as early as
January, he said - a surprise announcement that left Paris Bourse
officials, clearly not consulted, trying to water down the
minister's remarks.
	   The reaction reflected skepticism about cobbling together a
pan-European stock exchange any time soon.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of hardliners defied Iran's
president Friday by demonstrating their support for an attack on a
group of American visitors.
	   Demonstrations took place in three towns, including the capital,
Tehran, where the organizers, the Ansar-e-Hezbollah group, called
for the impeachment of Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, whose
ministry had granted visas to the Americans.
	   The protests came only a day after President Mohammad Khatami
had condemned the Nov. 21 attack on the Americans as a national
disgrace and ``an insult to the government.''
	   The demonstrations showed the continuing power struggle between
Khatami, a moderate reformist, and conservatives within the ruling
hierarchy. Ansar-e-Hezbollah is believed to backed by powerful
hardliners.
	   In last Saturday's attack, militants wielding iron bars and
throwing stones smashed the windows of a bus carrying 13
foreigners, mostly Americans, as it was driving through Tehran.
	   A radical Muslim group, Fedayeen Islam, claimed responsibility
for the attack, saying it was directed at ``U.S. spies'' and those
``who invited them'' _ an apparent reference to Khatami's call for
cultural exchanges between the United States and Iran.
	   In Friday's march in Tehran, the demonstrators burned 13
American flags _ one for each person on the bus.
	   The marchers also said that if another group of Americans
visited Tehran, ``it will be confronted more severely,'' the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The demonstration took place despite having been banned by the
authorities, the agency said.
	   Although hundreds took part in the Tehran demonstration, it was
not broadcast on the evening news of state television.
	   Khatami had said the Americans were tourists, but the Foreign
Ministry disclosed Friday _ before the march _ that they were
business executives who had been invited to Iran to explore
investment opportunities.
	   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said the Americans
were granted visas to increase pressure against U.S. sanctions that
ban American companies from investing in Iran.
	   ``Iran will use all possible means to increase public awareness,
as it welcomes the activities of foreign companies, including
American companies, against the U.S. sanctions,'' the agency quoted
Asefi as saying.
	   Speakers who addressed the Tehran march called on Khatami to
punish those who arranged the Americans' visit, the agency said.
	   ``Texts of the talks (with the Americans) should be published,''
one speaker said.
	   Similar demonstrations took place in the city of Mashad, 750
kilometers (470 miles) northeast of Tehran, and the town of Babol,
150 kilometers (94 miles) north of Tehran.
	   In Mashad, the protesters were said to have expressed their
``support and gratitude'' to those who attacked the Americans' bus,
witnesses contacted by telephone said.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly
after the 1979 revolution. It has imposed sanctions on Iran for its
alleged support of international terrorism.

U.S. envoy says Kosovo peace process entering critical stage

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Amid signs of a diplomatic push in
Kosovo, the U.S. envoy said Friday that the peace process was
entering a critical stage and the top ethnic Albanian leader
signaled that negotiations would start soon.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said the peace effort has picked up
speed.
	   ``I do believe we are getting to another critical moment,'' Hill
said after talks with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Rugova said, ``We are not far from political negotiations.''
	   Hill has been trying to get the Serb government and ethnic
Albanians to agree on a draft plan for the province so they can
meet and further advance political negotiations.
	   There have been fears that Kosovo could explode in a new round
of fighting if a solution is not found by the time the snow melts.
A crackdown that began in February and subsequent clashes have
claimed hundreds of lives and forced more than 300,000 people from
their homes in the Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian.
	   Serbia, itself the dominant republic in what is left of
Yugoslavia, regards Kosovo as the cradle of its culture, but many
ethnic Albanians there want independence.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, 175,000
homeless people are staying with friends or relatives, while nearly
100,000 are sheltered in other parts of Yugoslavia and neighboring
countries. About 65,000 people have fled the region.
	   Hill's plan keeps Kosovo loosely tied to Serbia, while moving
jurisdiction over the province to the level of the Yugoslav
federation, which also includes Montenegro.
	   It has been criticized by Serbia and greeted cautiously by
independence-minded ethnic Albanians.
	   Earlier this week, the government came up with a counter-plan
keeping the southern province firmly within Serbia.
	   Hill said the Serbian plan provided ``some useful suggestions,''
which the U.S. diplomats would try to incorporate into their
version. He planned to return to Kosovo next week with the reworked
draft.
	   Meanwhile, in a step hailed by a Western official as a ``small
but very important gesture,'' ethnic Albanian rebels freed two
journalists from the Yugoslav state news agency whom they abducted
Oct. 18. Western diplomats helped negotiate the men's release.
	   In a meeting with Hill, Yugoslav deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic
warned of ``energetic'' action against ethnic Albanian militants
unless they stop ``kidnapping and threatening lives'' in Kosovo.

Azerbaijani journalist sentenced for unpublished article
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ An Azerbaijani journalist was sentenced
Friday to a year and a half in a maximum-security prison for
writing an opposition-minded article _ even though it was never
published because of a censor's intervention.
	   A Baku city court found Fuad Gakhramanly guilty of calling for
violent sabotage in an article he titled ``Rally Tactics of the
Opposition.''
	   The article was confiscated by police during a search of the
Chag newspaper's editorial office on June 14 _ three weeks before
the country's authoritarian President Geidar Aliev abolished
censorship to appease western critics.
	   Gakhramanly was arrested on June 18.
	   Aliev's government has suppressed rallies by political
opponents. In one glaring case, police clubbed and beat
participants in an opposition rally on Sept. 12, injuring up to 200
protesters, according to the opposition.
	   The government says it was the protesters who beat the police.
	   On Friday, five members of opposition movements went on trial on
charges of beating 170 police officers.
	   Meanwhile, independent journalists continued a hunger strike
Friday for the third week in a row to protest police beatings and
libel suits against opposition media.
	   Following doctors' urging, some participants stopped their
strike on Friday, but new protesters took their place, said Rauf
Arifoglu, chief editor of the opposition Yeni Musavat newspaper.
	   The head of the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in
Europe, Bronislaw Geremek, who is also Poland's Foreign Minister,
expressed support for the protesters when he visited Azerbaijan for
talks with Aliev on Thursday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday
promised a thorough review of Israel's policy in Lebanon, saying he
cut short a trip to Europe and returned home to ``make decisions.''
	   However, Netanyahu also said he would only pull Israeli troops
out of southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to
attacks by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   With Hezbollah unwilling to give such guarantees, it is that
unlikely Israeli troops will redeploy any time soon.
	   Hezbollah commander Sheik Nabil Kaouk warned on Friday that
``any adventure by the Israeli occupiers to try and change the
status quo in south Lebanon will serve to increase its losses.''

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Friday began
compiling its first all-race voter list, but confusion marred the
day and even President Nelson Mandela registered at the wrong site.
	   South Africans lined up at schools, churches and other sites to
register for the 1999 election, the first since the 1994 all-race
balloting which marked the end of apartheid.
	   In Soweto, a sprawling black township and the scene of frequent
uprisings against white rule, about 50 men and women sat quietly in
a classroom at a run-down school with broken windows, awaiting
their turn to register. Some waited as long as six hours.
	   As a woman with a baby bound to her back by a blanket stood up
to register, one man murmured: ``We don't mind waiting. For us, it
is important to vote.''
	   It was only on Friday that many of the 12.7 million potential
voters in the northern section of the country learned which
registration site they should go to. Instructions were often vague
and many sites didn't open because civil servants who were supposed
to staff them failed to appear. The southern half of the country
registers on Dec. 4-6.
	   Opposition parties blasted the government.
	   ``The chaotic start of the registration process poses a serious
threat to a free and fair election,'' said the National Party,
which ruled during apartheid.
	   Mandela went to an elementary school in Johannesburg and duly
registered in front of photographers, but later was told the
Independent Electoral Commission had directed him to the wrong
place, said Thabo Masebe, spokesman for the ruling African National
Congress. Mandela would register again ``at his earliest possible
convenience,'' Masebe said.
	   There was less patience in a community center in the integrated,
run-down Johannesburg neighborhood of Yeoville, where dozens of
people were turned away after being told they were in the wrong
place.
	   ``I'm so sick of the muddle and disorganization of the bloody
ANC government,'' complained Barbara Durlacher, a 65-year-old white
who was told she was at the wrong site in Yeoville.

Angolan gov't accuses rebels of detaining U.N. staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government claimed Friday that the
former rebel group UNITA is holding 15 United Nations military
observers against their will at the group's rural headquarters.
	   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said the Security Council was
concerned about the situation, but did not confirm the government's
accusation. The rebels denied the claim.
	   In a written statement the government said UNITA was preventing
U.N. staff, who are overseeing implementation of the country's
crumbling 1994 peace pact, from leaving its central highland
strongholds Andulo and Bailundo.
	   Winhurst said the U.N. wanted to pull out the observers, but
UNITA had failed to give flight clearance for U.N. planes to land
at Andulo, citing bad weather and damage to the runway.
	   ``Every time we turn around there's another excuse ...The
excuses are less and less acceptable,'' Wimhurst said by phone from
New York, adding that the U.N. staff had not come under any threat.
	   Ten of the observers are Indian. The other five are Bulgarian,
Brazilian, Jordanian, Senegalese, and Swedish.
	   The government said last week that it had told the U.N. to
withdraw its staff from the towns because they were in a theater of
military operations.
	   Unconfirmed reports in recent days say the army has encircled
the two towns, where the UNITA leadership lives, 290 kilometers
(180 miles) south of Luanda, in preparation for an attack.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said in an interview
broadcast Friday on Luanda's Radio Eclesia that the government had
prohibited flights into Andulo, preventing the U.N. staff from
being evacuated.
	   The government, which waged a two-decade civil war against
UNITA, has accused the group of keeping an army hidden in the bush
of the vast southwest African nation and of attacking outlying
towns.

Support growing for Ireland to rejoin Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The possibility that Ireland might rejoin
the Commonwealth in recognition of its improving relations with
Britain gained support Friday from the organization's leader and
prominent Irish politicians.
	   ``Ireland is a very strong backer of democracy and it is
committed to human rights and socioeconomic development,
particularly in the developing world, and these are key commitments
in the Commonwealth,'' said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Nigerian
secretary-general of the 54-nation association of Britain and its
former colonies.
	   ``And Ireland has many friends in the Commonwealth, all of which
would want to see Ireland return, as Fiji, South Africa and
Pakistan returned,'' said Anyaoku, who will make his third visit to
Dublin Dec. 8-11.
	   Ireland withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1948 when it declared
itself a republic. That move came 26 years after it had negotiated
independence from Britain and after its decision to remain neutral
in World War II.
	   Political analysts have long considered the question of
rejoining the Commonwealth a likely card for the Irish Republic to
play if it was serious about building unity with Northern Ireland,
which has a British Protestant majority.
	   And Eamon O Cuiv, grandson of Irish statesman Eamon de Valera,
said Friday he would support Ireland's return to the Commonwealth
if it would promote closer north-south relations as envisioned in
April's peace accord for Northern Ireland.
	   ``I'm talking about this in the context of a rapidly changing
Ireland,'' said O Cuiv, a lawmaker in the party his grandfather
founded, Fianna Fail. ``Everything has changed with the Good Friday
agreement, and I think that people should look at this as it merits
and not let prejudices of the past blind their view.''
	   O Cuiv _ whose grandfather opposed the 1922 treaty with Britain
on the grounds it didn't completely sever Ireland's links with its
former master _ said most Commonwealth members today were
independent republics. ``I can't see why any republican would have
any difficulty with Ireland being a member of a free association of
nations,'' he said.
	   His comments followed Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's
statement Thursday _ while standing beside British Prime Minister
Tony Blair _ that he wouldn't stand in the way of debate on
rejoining the British institution.
	   Ahern, who leads Fianna Fail, said the Commonwealth was ``very
different'' than it was when his country left, though he stopped
short of saying he would favor a return.
	   Fianna Fail's junior partner in the current coalition
government, the Progessive Democrats, said joining the Commonwealth
was a good idea. So too did the country's traditional No. 2 party,
Fine Gael, whose founding fathers negotiated the 1922 treaty.
	   Since winning independence from Britain, Ireland has steered
clear of joining many international alliances. It is an
enthusiastic member of the United Nations and European Union, but
has resisted calls to take part in NATO, arguing this would
infringe on its neutrality.

Moya, Rusedski win as Sampras stays No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AM; Updates with quotes, recasts &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ While Pete Sampras savored his historic
achievement, Carlos Moya, the French Open champion, joined Sampras
and Tim Henman Friday in the semifinals of the ATP Tour World
Championship.
	   Moya, who had not won an indoor match all year until this week,
reached the semifinals by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5.
	   Sampras was not scheduled to play Friday and had the opportunity
to celebrate his unique accomplishment _ holding the No. 1 ranking
for the sixth consecutive year.
	   Moya is usually not much of a threat on indoor courts and
prefers clay, the surface on which he won the French Open, and hard
courts.
	   Although indoors, the ATP championship is played on a hard court
and Moya has done well at this elite season-ending event, reaching
the semifinals for the second consecutive year.
	   By avenging his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last year, he
ousted the Russian from the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that
nominally brings the top eight players of the year.
	   ``I was perhaps luckier in important moments,'' Moya said. ``I
had to be like a wall, put back every ball. I was mentally stronger
than last year.''
	   Moya, No. 4 in the world, will face Henman on Saturday.
	   Moya's first indoor victory of the season after five defeats
came at the start of the round-robin portion, when he beat Karol
Kucera. He lost to Sampras and finished behind him in one of the
four-man groups.
	   Greg Rusedski, an alternate who came in when Andre Agassi pulled
out with a back injury, crushed his fellow British teammate Henman
6-2, 6-4. He then waited for the outcome of the last match to see
if he'd qualified. Henman was already assured of a place in the
last four.
	   If Alex Corretja beat fellow Spaniard Albert Costa, Corretja
would be the fourth semifinalist. A Costa victory would allow
Rusedski to go through.
	   Either Rusedski or Corretja will face Sampras in the semifinals.
	   Sampras was assured finishing 1998 as No. 1 and breaking the
record he shared with Jimmy Connors when Marcelo Rios pulled out of
the event with a back injury.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras
said after crushing Karol Kucera 6-2, 6-1 late Thursday. Sampras
feels the record may never be broken again.
	   Other players paid tribute to Sampras.
	   ``It's amazing to be up there six years in a row,'' Moya said.
``The way he's been playing here, he's just unbeatable.''
	   ``He's proved he is the best player ever and he is playing
amazingly,'' the Spaniard said.
	   The said the record will certainly not be broken in this
generation of players. ``I don't see anyone right now who can be
No. 1 six years in a row,'' he said.
	   Rusedski said Sampras has been playing ``fabulous tennis'' here.
	   ``He looked like the No. 1 for the past 25 years easily,''
Rusedski said.
	   ``It's great to see him in the sixth year. It's going to be more
interesting if he can keep on going with that streak because he is
a great a player,'' Rusedski said.
	   ``You have to give credit to him for the way he's handled all
the pressure. he's not had the best year but he still managed to
finish No. 1, which is a tremendous result,'' he said.
	   If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the event in
1991, 1994 and the last two years.

Lawmaker fined for killing antelopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A lawmaker was detained for two days and
fined 1.6 million rupees (dlrs 37,500) by the wildlife authority
for killing two protected antelopes in a north Indian state, an
official said Friday.
	   Murad Lari, who belongs to lower caste Bahujan Samaj Party,
accompanied by his friends hunted and killed the antelopes outside
a wildlife sanctuary in Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh state
on Monday, Ram Lakhan Singh, the state's chief wildlife warden,
said.
	   The sanctuary is 670 kilometers (415 miles) southeast of New
Delhi, the Indian capital.
	   Acting on a tip, the wildlife sanctuary wardens raided the
farmhouse of a friend of Lari and found that one of the spotted
deer had been skinned and was being cooked. They also found the
carcass of the other antelope, Singh said.
	   Lari and ten of his friends were arrested and later released on
Wednesday by the wildlife department, Singh said.
	   The wildlife department said it would file a court case on
Saturday charging Lari and his friends with killing protected
antelopes. If convicted, they could jailed up to seven years.
	   Three Indian film actors and three actresses are facing trial in
northwestern Rajasthan state for allegedly killing eight antelopes
in two safaris one and a half months ago.

Angolan gov't accuses rebels of detaining U.N. staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The government claimed Friday that the
former rebel group UNITA is holding 15 United Nations military
observers against their will at the group's rural headquarters.
	   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said the Security Council was
concerned about the situation, but did not confirm the government's
accusation. The rebels denied the claim.
	   In a written statement the government said UNITA was preventing
U.N. staff, who are overseeing implementation of the country's
crumbling 1994 peace pact, from leaving its central highland
strongholds Andulo and Bailundo.
	   Winhurst said the U.N. wanted to pull out the observers, but
UNITA had failed to give flight clearance for U.N. planes to land
at Andulo, citing bad weather and damage to the runway.
	   ``Every time we turn around there's another excuse ...The
excuses are less and less acceptable,'' Wimhurst said by phone from
New York, adding that the U.N. staff had not come under any threat.
	   Ten of the observers are Indian. The other five are Bulgarian,
Brazilian, Jordanian, Senegalese, and Swedish.
	   The government said last week that it had told the U.N. to
withdraw its staff from the towns because they were in a theater of
military operations.
	   Unconfirmed reports in recent days say the army has encircled
the two towns, where the UNITA leadership lives, 290 kilometers
(180 miles) south of Luanda, in preparation for an attack.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said in an interview
broadcast Friday on Luanda's Radio Eclesia that the government had
prohibited flights into Andulo, preventing the U.N. staff from
being evacuated.
	   The government, which waged a two-decade civil war against
UNITA, has accused the group of keeping an army hidden in the bush
of the vast southwest African nation and of attacking outlying
towns.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of hard-liners defied Iran's
president Friday by demonstrating their support for an attack on a
group of American visitors.
	   Demonstrations took place in three towns, including the capital,
Tehran, where the organizers, the Ansar-e-Hezbollah group, called
for the impeachment of Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, whose
ministry granted visas to the Americans.
	   The protests came a day after President Mohammad Khatami
condemned the Nov. 21 attack as a national disgrace and ``an insult
to the government.''
	   The demonstrations showed the continuing power struggle between
Khatami, a moderate reformer, and conservatives within the ruling
hierarchy. Ansar-e-Hezbollah is believed to be backed by powerful
hard-liners.
	   In the attack, militants wielding iron bars and throwing stones
smashed the windows of a bus carrying 13 foreigners, mostly
Americans, on its way through Tehran.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly
after the 1979 revolution. It has imposed sanctions on Iran for its
alleged support of international terrorism.
	   A radical Muslim group, Fedayeen Islam, claimed responsibility,
saying it was directed at ``U.S. spies'' and those ``who invited
them'' _ an apparent reference to Khatami's call for cultural
exchanges between the United States and Iran.
	   In Friday's march in Tehran, the demonstrators burned 13
American flags _ one for each person on the bus.
	   The marchers also said that if another group of Americans visits
Tehran, ``it will be confronted more severely,'' the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The demonstration took place despite a ban, the agency said.
Although hundreds took part, the demonstration was not broadcast on
state TV's evening news.
	   Khatami said the Americans were tourists, but the Foreign
Ministry said Friday _ before the march _ that they were business
executives who had been invited to Iran to explore investment
opportunities.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said the Americans
were granted visas to increase pressure against U.S. sanctions that
ban American companies from investing in Iran.
	   ``Iran will use all possible means to increase public awareness,
as it welcomes the activities of foreign companies, including
American companies, against the U.S. sanctions,'' the agency quoted
Asefi as saying.
	   Speakers who addressed the Tehran march called on Khatami to
punish those who arranged the visit, the agency said.
	   Similar demonstrations took place in the city of Mashad, 750
kilometers (470 miles) northeast of Tehran, and the town of Babol,
150 kilometers (94 miles) north of Tehran.
	   In Mashad, the protesters were said to have expressed their
``support and gratitude'' for those who attacked the bus, witnesses
said by telephone.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Nick Price shot a bogey-free, 4-under 68
and moved into a share of the lead Friday with South Africans
Tjaart van der Walt and Warren Abery after two rounds of the
Zimbabwe Open.
	   The trio were at 7-under 137, one shot ahead of Mark Wiltshire,
who came in with a 70.
	   Abery matched Price's score for the second day while Van der
Walt shot 71 after an opening-round 66.
	   ``After some serious practice, was driving well today and only
missed one fairway _ and that by just a yard,'' Price said. ``I
actually played better than my 68 and if I could have read the
breaks on the greens I would have had a lower score.''
	   Darren Fitchardt shot a 68, including an eagle, six birdies and
four bogeys, and was alone in fifth at 139, one stroke in front of
a trio of players that included Zimbabwean Tony Johnstone.
	   Johnstone shot a 68 that left him tied with South Africans Mark
Ireland (68) and Hennie Walters (69).
	   Brazilian Adilson da Silva had a 67 and was among a group of
nine at 141.
	   Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe recoved from his opening-day 74 with a
70 and was seven shots off the pace at 144.

African leaders expected at continent-wide Congo talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ About 25 African leaders are
expected to meet in Burkina Faso next month as part of new
Africa-wide bid to broker peace in war-divided Congo, foreign
ministry officials said Friday.
	   The conference on December 16 and 17 will mark the handover of
mediation efforts by southern African countries to the continent's
premier diplomatic grouping, the Organization of African Unity, a
spokesman for Burkina Faso's foreign ministry said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Burkina Faso President Blaise Campaore is the current chairman
of the OAU.
	   Previously the Southern African Development Community, led by
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, has dominated a series of
negotiations since August to resolve the war between Congo's
government and rebels who have captured a wide swath of land in the
east.
	   The SADC efforts have been variously criticized by rebels and
the government of being impartial. Several SADC members _ Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia _ have sent troops and equipment in support of
Congo President Laurent Kabila's government, which refuses to
negotiate with the rebels.
	   It was not clear whether a rebel delegation would be attending
the December conference.
	   Chad is also supporting the government while Congo's eastern
African neighbors Uganda and Rwanda are fighting on the rebels'
side. Government forces have recently begun bombing rebel targets
in the east in an escalation of the war.
	   The December conference is expected to include delegations from
Eritrea and Ethiopia, which are engaged in a border quarrel which
has flared into fighting on several occasions this year. That
dispute could also be discussed by participants at the conference,
the foreign affairs official said.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In his most candid remarks yet on the
economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday
that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the
EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1.
	   Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation in the
pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to
boost the economy.
	   He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market
conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate cuts
toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate
countries.
	   Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and
Dec. 22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will
gauge the outlook for inflation and the European Union economy.
	   The bank, which will set monetary policy for the currency bloc,
has been under pressure from politicians to keep interest rates low
to help boost growth and create jobs. While inflation is at its
lowest levels in decades _ just 1 percent in the euro-zone _
unemployment in the 11 nations remains stubbornly high at 10.9
percent.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Train service slowed to a crawl on Friday during
the second national rail strike in a week in France. A poll showed
support for train workers' grievances remains strong but is waning.
	   About one in three long-distance trains was running Friday and
one in four regional trains, the state-run train authority, the
SNCF, said. Heavily used suburban lines were hobbled.
	   Eurostar trains to London were not affected by the strike.
	   Early Friday morning at the Gare de l'Est, travelers crowded
around revised timetables that were often incorrect.
	   ``It's going to be really difficult today,'' SNCF employee Said
Skender told a group of some 20 people gathered around an
information booth at the Gare de l''Est.
	   ``Even if the timetable says 1:00 p.m., you never know when the
train will actually leave.''
	   A few people were visibly irate, shouting at employees.
	   ``There's supposed to be minimum service,'' called out one
person waiting for a train. ``This isn't minimum service. I'm not
going to get there at all.''
	   But many travelers said they sympathized with strikers.
	   ``They know what they have to do to get people to listen to
their problems,'' said Parisian Pulal Ardobah, 35. ``It's annoying,
but I understand.''
	   A poll by the CSA firm, published in Friday's edition of the
daily Le Parisien showed that 56 percent of those sampled support
or have sympathy for strikers, compared to 25 percent who are
opposed or hostile.
	   But that is a drop from the 70 percent sympathy rating
registered during Monday's strike by rail workers in six European
countries, including France, to protest plans to open state-owned
railways to private operators in the European Union.
	   The EU said the proposed changes, which are not set to go into
effect immediately, would be limited to the freight sector.
	   The margin of error for the poll, which sampled 1,001 adults,
was not available, but with such a sampling is usually plus or
minus three percent.
	   Rail workers are protesting what they see as insufficient staff,
and are concerned about how the government will implement a plan to
cut the workweek from 39 to 35 hours.
	   A number of train drivers and ticket controllers decided to
continue the walkout Saturday, meaning more misery for passengers
this weekend.

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Rescuers using cranes and acetylene torches
to cut through the wreckage of two trains Friday have extricated
205 bodies after one of India's worst railway crashes in recent
times.
	   Police and railway officials in the wheat-trading town of
Khanna, in the northwestern state of Punjab, said the death toll
would probably rise after the last of the wreckage is cleared
Saturday.
	   Ten more passengers were feared buried in the mangled debris,
said S.P. Mehta, a general manager of Indian Railways.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi and
toppled into the path of the oncoming train on a parallel track in
pre-dawn mist Thursday.
	   No survivors have been found since midday Thursday. Officials
said 260 people were injured and about 30 were in critical
condition. Teams of doctors operated all night Thursday, amputating
the legs or hands of some of the victims.
	   Nearly 1,500 grieving relatives converged on Khanna on Friday to
find survivors or identify the dead.
	   Of the 205 bodies recovered, 123 were identified. Most of the
rest were badly mutilated and remained unclaimed, Mehta said.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's fiery opposition leader refused
to recognize the nation's first post-communist Constitution on
Friday, calling for anti-government street protests Saturday to
mark the country's upcoming independence day.
	   The constitution, which Western officials have said is necessary
to strengthen the Balkan nation's fragile democracy, will take
effect when a presidential decree is signed Saturday.
	   But Sali Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party,
said low voter turnout in last weekend's referendum showed the
document had no support, and his party would refuse to recognize
its legitimacy.
	   Albania's Central Voting Commission announced Friday that
slightly more than half of the country's registered voters
participated in the election, and an overwhelming 93 percent voted
in favor of the Constitution.
	   Approval had been all but guaranteed after the opposition,
locked in a power struggle with the government since Berisha was
ousted as president of Albania last year, urged its supporters to
boycott the vote.
	   Berisha claimed voters had rejected the Constitution and said
only 39 percent had turned out to vote. He didn't explain how he
arrived at the figure, but said the high abstention rate showed
support for his party.
	   ``If this were parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party
would have won two-thirds of the votes, '' Berisha said.
	   He called on his supporters, mainly militants from northern
Albania, to rally against the government Saturday in downtown
Tirana. Nov. 28 marks the anniversary of Albania's creation as a
state in 1912.
	   Recent opposition rallies against the referendum have not
generated the intensity of those in September, which resulted in
two days of rioting and forced the ouster of Prime Minister Fatos
Nano. Only 2,000 people showed up at a Democratic rally earlier
this week.
	   The voting commission's announcement that 50.57 percent of
registered voters participated in the referendum is a good sign for
the government, which had feared a low turnout would weaken its
hold on power and worsen the atmosphere of political uncertainty.
	   The new constitution outlines civil, democratic and human rights
in the country of 3.2 million, which emerged from communism in
1991.
	   But it is unlikely to bring an end to the fierce political fight
between the ruling Socialists and the opposition Democrats.
	   The opposition complained about what it called ``grave
incidents'' at several polling stations, including beatings of its
commissioners. Foreign observers said they saw no such violence.
	   The Socialists, meanwhile, accused local government officials
supportive of the Democrats of manipulating voter lists by
registering dead people and emigrants.
	   Foreign observers considered Sunday's vote an improvement over
last year's parliamentary elections, marred with violence and
irregularities.

	   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Serb journalists and two
ethnic Albanian politicians abducted last month by Kosovo's rebels,
were released Friday from a guerrilla stronghold in the strife-torn
province.
	   In the presence of chief international observer William Walker,
the ethnic Albanian rebels set free reporter Nebojsa Radosevic, 32,
and photographer Vladimir Dobricic, 50, both of the state-run
Tanjug news agency, in the guerrilla stronghold of Dragobilje in
central Kosovo.
	   They were kidnapped Oct. 18 while on assignment in the area.
	   The KLA agreed to release the two, following 10 days of
negotiations with international observers from the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, Walker said.
	   The rebel group also released Jakup Kastrati and Cen Desku,
members of the main ethnic Albanian political party, who had been
held since Oct. 30, Walker said. They were handed over to
international observers in Dragobilje after the two journalists
were released, he said.
	   ``This was perhaps a small, but I think very significant moment
in what has been happening in Kosovo over the past few months,''
Walker said. ``Hopefully this will be the beginning of a process by
which others who are illegally detained are released.''
	   ``We were treated well from the beginning,'' Dobricic told
waiting reporters after two hooded KLA fighters escorted him to
waiting international observers. ``There was no physical harassment
and now we just want to go home.''
	   The two journalists said they had been held in four different
places during their detention, but harbored ``no negative
feelings'' towards their captors.
	   ``With this act ... (KLA) wants to show that it respects
international war and peace conventions,'' a statement issued by
the group and carried by the independent Beta news agency said.
	   A KLA fighter who declined to give his name said the release was
an act of good will in honor of the Albanian national day on Nov.
28, which is also celebrated across the border in Albania. ``With
these actions, we show we only want to live in an independent and
free state,'' he said.
	   Walker, who heads the Kosovo observation mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, praised the
release.
	   ``This is obviously very good news for the detainees and their
families but I think it's also good news for Kosovo,'' Walker said.
``We in the OSCE see this as a small but very important gesture _ a
confidence-building measure we hope will be taken advantage of.''
	   According to the OSCE, about 870 people are missing in Kosovo,
believed held by the KLA or Serb authorities. The KLA represent
Kosovo's independence-minded ethnic Albanian majority that has been
fighting Serbs since February.
	   The abduction drew condemnation from human rights and media
watchdog organizations. The International Red Cross and other
organizations pleaded for their release.

Eberharter leads Austrian top five sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Stefan Eberharter led an Austrian sweep
of the top five places Friday in the opening super-giant slalom of
the Alpine World Cup season.
	   Eberharter, 29, continued his spectacular early-season skiing
with a run of 1 minute, 11.81 seconds _ more than a half-second
faster than runner-up Hermann Maier, the defending World Cup
overall, super-G and giant slalom champion, who finished in
1:12.33.
	   Christian Mayer came out of the second seed to finish third in
1:12.45 but relinquished the World Cup overall lead to Eberharter,
whose victory gave him 280 points and a 30-point advantage.
	   Rainer Salzgeber, another second-seeded Austrian, was fourth in
1:12.49, and Hans Knauss completed the Austrian dominance by
placing fifth in 1:12.85.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus was sixth in 1:12.89, France's Jean-Luc
Cretier placed seventh in 1:12.99, and Switzerland's Steve Locher
was eighth in 1:13.06. Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway was ninth in
1:13.07.
	   Eberharter, the Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom, won a
giant slalom last Friday in Park City, Utah, and was second to
Maier in a season-opening giant slalom last month in Soelden,
Austria.
	   The race marked the return of the World Cup skiing to Aspen,
once a regular stop, for the first time since 1995. A men's slalom
is scheduled for Saturday.

On 20th anniversary, Kurd rebel movement faces choice of fighting,
</HEADLINE>
or trying peace &QL;

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities tightened security around the
country Friday for fear of attacks timed to the 20th anniversary of
a Kurdish rebel organization, despite the rebel leader's
declaration that the group had given up armed struggle.
	   Investigators examined the wreckage left by a bomb that blew up
a bus on a road about 50 miles east of Ankara, killing four and
injuring 17 early Friday.
	   Suspicion fell on the Kurdistan Workers Party, blamed for
similar bombings in its war for Kurdish autonomy.
	   If the PKK were shown responsible, the attack stands to
discredit Abdullah Ocalan's claim this month that the rebels would
now use only peaceful means to advance the Kurdish cause.
	   On Friday, authorities posted extra police and military at
airports, military posts and ammunition depots.
	   Ocalan founded the PKK in 1978 to seek greater cultural rights
for Kurds, who sought official recognition as a distinct minority
and freedom to use their own language in schools and broadcasting.
	   The movement turned into a guerrilla army in 1984, launching 14
years of attacks on civilians and clashes with Turkey's army.
	   Ocalan announced a PKK change of policy shortly after his Nov.
12 arrest in Rome, where he is now awaiting a decision on his
request for political asylum.
	   ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' Ocalan said Wednesday in Rome.
	   It was not clear if Ocalan's attempts at transforming the PKK
into a political movement will be successful _ or if his guerrillas
would heed his orders from Europe.
	   In Rome, a small group of Kurds marked Friday's anniversary by
gathering in the square outside the military hospital where Ocalan
was detained for two weeks after his arrival.
	   They put up a marble plaque renaming the square ``Piazza
Kurdistan.''
	   The international attention to Ocalan's case could push Turkey
to review its Kurdish policy, which does not grant minority rights
to some 12 million Kurds.
	   Some non-Kurdish Turks believe the time has come to lift a ban
on the use of the Kurdish language.
	   ``Let them have schools, let them have television,'' Hikmet
Cetinkaya, a columnist for daily Cumhuriyet daily. ``These are
basic human rights.''
	   The fighting has claimed some 37,000 lives and stained Turkey's
human rights record, often cited by European Union countries as an
obstacle to Turkey's full membership in the 15-nation bloc.
	   The conflict also blocked the economic development of the
Kurdish-dominated southeast. Turkey's short-lived governments have
been unable to attract investment for the region.
	   Even if the rebels have changed tactics, Turkey's influential
military seems determined to keep fighting.
	   ``This struggle will be maintained in every condition,'' Gen.
Erol Tutal declared Thursday.

Moscow mayor visits Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading
presidential hopeful in Russia's next elections, toured a
Belarusian car plant and a cancer hospital Friday and conferred
with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
	   Luzhkov is making several foreign trips in an apparent bid to
raise his foreign profile. While he is extremely powerful and
popular in Moscow, he is little known outside Russia.
	   On Friday, he led a large delegation of Moscow executives on a
visit to the Minsk Autoworks and viewed Moscow-made medical
equipment at a cancer research institute in the Belarusian capital.
	   Lukashenko, who openly pines for the Soviet Union and has sought
to increase his country's ties with neighboring Russia, welcomed
the Moscow mayor.
	   ``No matter what Yuri Mikhailovich (Luzhkov) becomes, he has
always been and will remain my good friend and good comrade,''
Lukashenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   Luzhkov focused on economic ties between Moscow and Belarus.
Trade volume between the two was dlrs 2.3 billion last year and
dlrs 2 billion so far this year, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

Dublin drug dealer convicted of murdering crime reporter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES throughout with detail on judgment, witness,
comment from victim's widower
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Three judges convicted a Dublin drug
dealer Friday of murdering the investigative journalist Veronica
Guerin in a bid to silence her exposes of Ireland's criminal
underworld.
	   Paul ``Hippo'' Ward, 34, remained stony-faced as he received a
life sentence in the no-jury Special Criminal Court, which is
normally reserved for terrorist cases. The presiding judges ruled
that he had disposed of the motorcycle and .357 Magnum handgun used
by two accomplices to slay Guerin, 36, behind the wheel of her car
in June 1996.
	   Their 40-page ruling condemned the police handling of the case _
deeming three written confessions by Ward implausible, illegally
gained and inadmissable _ but accepted the uncorroborated testimony
of Ward's state-protected accomplice, Charles Bowden.
	   Reading the judgment, Justice Robert Barr called Bowden ``a
self-serving, deeply avaricious liar'' who nonetheless had offered
a devastatingly detailed account of his and Ward's roles in
Guerin's assassination.
	   Bowden, 34, is already serving a six-year sentence for drugs
trafficking and arms possession, and in isolated confinement for
his own protection. He received immunity from further prosecution
in exchange for his evidence.
	   Bowden testified that he supplied the gun and bullets used in
the attack, while Ward was given the clean-up role. He said they
both took part in wider discussions about how best to kill Guerin,
and Ward monitored police communications on a scanner to aid in the
gunmen's getaway.
	   Ward, who had been in custody since his October 1996 arrest,
readily accepted he and Bowden were part of Dublin's biggest
drug-dealing gang. But he denied any involvement in the death of
Guerin. His lawyers said Friday they intended to appeal.
	   Two other figures who featured in Guerin's reports _ John
Gilligan and Brian Meehan _ face their own trials on charges of
murdering her.
	   Meehan is already in custody in Ireland's Portlaoise prison and
due for trial in June, while the gang's alleged leader, Gilligan,
is fighting extradition from England, where is already imprisoned
on drugs-trafficking offenses. Bowden is expected to testify
against both.
	   Guerin's killing _ the first of a journalist in the Irish
Republic _ spurred authorities to launch a largely successful
crackdown on criminal networks in Dublin.
	   The government founded a witness protection program that made
Bowden its first client, gave a new Criminal Assets Bureau strong
powers to seize property owned by suspected criminals, and
committed itself to hiring more police and building more prisons.
	   Guerin had previously been shot in the leg and beaten up by
criminals angered by her reports, but rejected offers of long-term
protection by police on the grounds it would make her job more
difficult.
	   Her husband, Graham Turley, was in court for Friday's verdict
and welcomed it as demonstrating ``fair play'' by the police and
government.
	   Turley said he hoped the government would now grant police
increased powers ``to do the job they're meant to be doing. They've
had their hands tied for so long.''
	   ``I know Veronica won't rest in peace until everybody that's
meant to be behind bars is behind bars,'' Turley said.

It will be a big day for the Fluties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bill Flutie will be looking for a big victory
when the Buffalo Bills play the New England Patriots Sunday.
	   The 11-year-old boy will compete as one of five regional
finalists in the 10- to 11-year-old division of the U.S. National
Football League's Punt, Pass and Kick Championship _ a junior
skills competition, then watch as Uncle Doug tries to lead the
visiting Bills over the Patriots in an important AFC East matchup.
	   The game at Foxboro, Massachusetts, will be a homecoming for
Doug Flutie, who grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, also young
Bill's hometown. The Bills quarterback won the Heisman Trophy as
the best American college player at Boston College and played for
the Patriots for three seasons (1987-89) before spending eight
years in the Canadian Football League.
	   Flutie's play upon his return to the NFL this year is the major
reason the Bills (7-4) are tied for first in the AFC East with
Miami and the New York Jets. Flutie also is 10-0 at Foxboro
Stadium, where he played five games with Boston College and five
with the Patriots.
	   The Bills, who beat the Patriots 13-10 Nov. 15, also count on
the AFC's No. 2 rushing attack (138.5 yards), led by Antowain
Smith, who has run for 788 yards and five touchdowns.
	   The Patriots (6-5) have struggled since winning four of their
first five games, but they remained in the division title fight by
beating Miami 26-23 Monday night when Drew Bledsoe passed for 423
yards.
	   In other NFL games Sunday, Denver plays at San Diego, New
Orleans at Miami, Carolina at the New York Jets, Tennessee at
Seattle, Arizona at Kansas City, Atlanta at St. Louis, Indianapolis
at Baltimore, Jacksonville at Cincinnati, Tampa Bay at Chicago,
Philadelphia at Green Bay and Washington at Oakland.
	   The New York Giants play at San Francisco Monday night.
	   On Thanksgiving Day, Detroit beat Pittsburgh 19-16 in overtime
and Minnesota defeated Dallas 46-36.
 &UR; Broncos at Chargers &QC; 
	   John Elway and Terrell Davis, the league's top-rated passer and
leading rusher, respectively, will face the NFL's top-ranked
defense (255.7) as the Broncos look to go 12-0 with their 17th
straight victory, including the last postseason. Quarterback Craig
Whelihan has won his last two starts for the Chargers (5-6).
 &UR; Saints at Dolphins &QC; 
	   The Dolphins (7-4) are looking to rebound from their loss to the
Patriots. Miami wide receiver O.J. McDuffie has 24 catches for 314
yards in the past three games. Although the Saints (5-6) lost 31-20
to the 49ers last week, Kerry Collins passed for 328 yards and ran
for a touchdown in his second start for the team.
 &UR; Panthers at Jets &QC; 
	   Vinny Testaverde will be looking to go 8-1 as the starting
quarterback for the Jets (7-4). Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson has
caught 53 passes for 755 yards and eight touchdowns for New York.
Wide receiver Rocket Ismail has caught 53 passes for 748 yards and
six touchdowns for the Panthers (2-9).
 &UR; Oilers at Seahawks &QC; 
	   Quarterback Jon Kitna will try to go 2-0 as a starter for the
Seahawks (5-6) as a replacement for Warren Moon. The Oilers (6-5)
have the the AFC's second-leading rusher in Eddie George (1,025
yards).
 &UR; Cardinals at Chiefs &QC; 
	   The Cardinals (6-5) might be what the Chiefs (4-7) need to stop
a six-game losing streak. In their last 17 games against NFC teams,
the AFC Chiefs have won 15.
 &UR; Falcons at Rams &QC; 
	   Led by quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal
Anderson (10 touchdowns), the Falcons (9-2) are having their best
season ever, but Chandler is listed as doubtful because of ankle
and knee problems. Chandler's backup is 44-year-old Steve DeBerg.
The Rams (3-8) will be trying to snap a three-game losing streak to
the Falcons.
 &UR; Colts at Ravens &QC; 
	   Peyton Manning has thrown a touchdown pass in eight straight
games for the Colts (2-9), the most by a rookie since Joe Namath in
1965. Michael McCrary, a defensive end for the Ravens (4-7), has 33
sacks in his last 33 games.
 &UR; Jaguars at Bengals &QC; 
	   The Jaguars (8-3) need to complete a sweep of the Bengals (2-9)
to increase their AFC Central lead to two games. Jaguars running
back Fred Taylor has 10 rushing touchdowns and two receiving TDs in
the last eight games. Corey Dillon needs 119 rushing yards to
become the second Bengals player with consecutive 1,000-yard
seasons.
 &UR; Buccaneers at Bears &QC; 
	   Rookie wide receiver Jacquez Green of the Bucs (4-7) leads the
NFL with a 17.2-yard average on punt returns. Glyn Milburn of the
Bears (3-8) is third among league punt returners with a 14.4
average.
 &UR; Eagles at Packers &QC; 
	   Brett Favre of the Packers (7-4) needs 67 passing yards to join
Miami's Dan Marino (9) and Denver's John Elway (7) as the only
quarterbacks in NFL history with seven straight 3,000-yard seasons.
Wide receiver Irving Fryar of the Eagles (2-9) will be making his
100th consecutive start.
 &UR; Redskins at Raiders &QC; 
	   Matt Turk of the Redskins (2-9) leads the NFL with a 40.8-yard
net punting average. Quarterback Donald Hollas is 4-1 as a starter
for the Raiders (7-4).

Fire breaks out at Russian mine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire broke out at a mine in northern Russia on
Friday, filling a mine shaft with smoke and halting operations, a
news report said. No casualties were reported.
	   The blaze started near the main ventilation shaft of the
Oktyabrskaya mine in Vorkuta, about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles)
northeast of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The fire was extinguished Friday night. The cause and extent of
damages were unclear, the report said.
	   Russia's cash-strapped mines suffer frequent accidents because
of poor equipment and lax safety standards.

Expert says two people attacked slain Canadian teen-ager in
</HEADLINE>
Bermuda &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Multiple wounds on the body of a
Canadian teen-ager visiting Bermuda suggest that two people took
part in the attack that killed her, a well-known pathologist said
Friday.
	   Dr. Michael Baden, who testified at the O.J. Simpson trial and
helped identify the remains of the last Russian czar, was
testifying for the second day in the murder trial of Bermudean
Justis Smith.
	   Smith pleaded innocent to the premeditated murder of 16-year-old
Rebecca Middleton on July 3, 1996. The charge carries the death
sentence in this British colony, though nobody has been executed in
more than 20 years.
	   Baden told the court that two pairs of hands were needed to
inflict the kind of injuries found on the teen-ager from
Belleville, Ontario. He said two hands were needed to hold down her
arms, another to hold her head and a fourth to inflict the stab
wounds.
	   That suggested two attackers, said Baden, director of forensic
science services for the New York state police.
	   After examining the forensic report, police reports, photographs
and visiting the scene, Baden identified 40 separate injuries on
Middleton's body. These included about 17 stab wounds, superficial
cuts and blunt-force injuries.
	   Baden said the superficial wounds were inflicted before
Middleton was mortally wounded. ``These were wounds meant to cause
Rebecca Middleton to do something she didn't want to do,'' Baden
said. ``These were torture wounds.''
	   Defense lawyer John Perry has told the court he will show that
Smith's companion on the fatal night was responsible for
Middleton's death.
	   Smith was 17 when he and friend Kirk Mundy offered her a ride on
their motorcycle. Middleton's bloodied body, with 17 stab wounds,
was found hours later near a patch of woodland.
	   At his trial two years ago, Mundy, 23, testified that he had
consensual sex with Middleton and left her to go to a nearby bay to
wash up. Then, he said, he heard her scream and saw Smith attacking
her.
	   Mundy pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in the
murder and is serving a five-year sentence. Later, prosecutors
tried to charge Mundy with murder, but their attempt to re-try him
was rejected by two appeals courts.
	   Smith's trial began this week and is expected to last six weeks.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After a 7-year absence, retired soccer great
Diego Maradona returned Friday to Italy _ and to the drug scandals
that drove him from the country.
	   Maradona came off the plane at Milan's airport wearing a scarf
with the colors of Napoli, the team for which he was playing when
he was suspended for flunking a drug test in 1991.
	   Dozens of fans waving the Napoli flag were there to greet him.
	   Maradona is expected to talk in coming days with investigators
examining possible substance abuse in Italian soccer.
	   Maradona also will demand financial compensation for an
allegedly botched drug test taken during his playing days in Italy,
manager Guillermo Coppola says.
	   The Italian lab that performed the test closed last month after
accusations that it mishandled drug tests and their documentation.
The closing came during a series of investigations into drug use in
Italian soccer; findings announced so far have cited only use of
legal performance-enhancing supplements.
	   It's not known how much money Maradona, 38, is seeking.
	   A confessed cocaine addict, Maradona has always maintained his
innocence in the 1991 suspension, saying he often took his own
private tests before matches. He charged the suspension was revenge
for Argentina's victory over Italy in the 1990 World Cup
semifinals.
	   Maradona was suspended for 15 months in 1994 after testing
positive for banned stimulants while playing for Argentina's
national team during the World Cup.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities tightened security around the
country Friday for fear of attacks timed to the 20th anniversary of
a Kurdish rebel organization, despite the rebel leader's
declaration that the group had given up armed struggle.
	   Investigators examined the wreckage left by a bomb that blew up
a bus on a road about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Ankara,
killing four and injuring 17 early Friday.
	   Suspicion fell on the Kurdistan Workers Party, blamed for
similar bombings in its war for Kurdish autonomy.
	   If the PKK were shown responsible, the attack stands to
discredit Abdullah Ocalan's claim this month that the rebels would
now use only peaceful means to advance the Kurdish cause.
	   On Friday, authorities posted extra police and military at
airports, military posts and ammunition depots.
	   Ocalan founded the PKK in 1978 to seek greater cultural rights
for Kurds, who sought official recognition as a distinct minority
and freedom to use their own language in schools and broadcasting.
	   The movement turned into a guerrilla army in 1984, launching 14
years of attacks on civilians and clashes with Turkey's army.
	   Ocalan announced a PKK change of policy shortly after his Nov.
12 arrest in Rome, where he is now awaiting a decision on his
request for political asylum.
	   ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' Ocalan said Wednesday in Rome.
	   It was not clear if Ocalan's attempts at transforming the PKK
into a political movement will be successful _ or if his guerrillas
would heed his orders from Europe.
	   In Rome, a small group of Kurds marked Friday's anniversary by
gathering in the square outside the military hospital where Ocalan
was detained for two weeks after his arrival.
	   They put up a marble plaque renaming the square ``Piazza
Kurdistan.''
	   The international attention to Ocalan's case could push Turkey
to review its Kurdish policy, which does not grant minority rights
to some 12 million Kurds.
	   Some non-Kurdish Turks believe the time has come to lift a ban
on the use of the Kurdish language.
	   ``Let them have schools, let them have television,'' Hikmet
Cetinkaya, a columnist for daily Cumhuriyet daily. ``These are
basic human rights.''
	   The fighting has claimed some 37,000 lives and stained Turkey's
human rights record, often cited by European Union countries as an
obstacle to Turkey's full membership in the 15-nation bloc.
	   The conflict also blocked the economic development of the
Kurdish-dominated southeast. Turkey's short-lived governments have
been unable to attract investment for the region.
	   Even if the rebels have changed tactics, Turkey's influential
military seems determined to keep fighting.
	   ``This struggle will be maintained in every condition,'' Gen.
Erol Tutal declared Thursday.

Pinochet's fate in hands of Cabinet's law and order man
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jack Straw, the Cabinet member who will decide
whether former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet must face
extradition proceedings, is known as a rigorous defender of the
law. Just ask his son.
	   When a newspaper in January claimed that William Straw, then 17,
had sold marijuana to a reporter, his father marched him to the
nearest police station. The boy received an official warning.
	   Straw's aplomb will be sorely tested as he faces the most
difficult decision of his political career.
	   He has until Dec. 11 to decide whether Spanish magistrates will
be allowed to seek Pinochet's extradition on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture during his 17-year rule in Chile. Pinochet
was arrested Oct. 16 while staying in a London hospital.
	   If Straw blocks extradition hearings, it's likely to damage his
popularity amongst the Labor Party's rank-and-file leftists. If he
permits it to go ahead, he will face criticism for damaging
Britain's trade and political ties with Chile.
	   British law gives Straw some leeway to consider compassionate
issues _ in Pinochet's case, whether he is now too frail to stand
trial.
	   Earlier this year, Straw decided to free Roisin McAliskey, a
Northern Ireland woman who was wanted in Germany in connection with
an IRA bombing. Her supporters had said McAliskey's physical and
mental health had declined while she was in prison _ where she gave
birth to a daughter.
	   Straw, a 52-year-old barrister, became Home Secretary in Labor's
1997 national election victory.
	   With a strong line on law and order, he was a key figure in
promoting ``new Labor'' as a safe, middle-of-the-road party. And in
office, he has championed curfews for unruly youngsters and laws
clamping down on football hooligans.
	   Straw was born into a what he has called an ``economically
working class, culturally middle class'' home in Essex, a county
east of London. His father was a nonconformist conscientious
objector, his mother a teacher. He cultivated the nickname Jack at
school after one of the leaders of England's 1381 peasants' revolt.
	   Straw reached national prominence when he became the first
left-wing president of the National Union of Students in 1969,
riding the wave of anti-Vietnam protests of the 1960s which saw the
organization move sharply to the left.
	   After university Straw became a lawyer by profession, but worked
for only two years as an attorney before immersing himself
full-time in politics. He won his Parliamentary seat representing
the northwest city of Blackburn in 1979, an otherwise disastrous
election for Labor and the beginning of 18 years of Conservative
government.
	   In his early career, Straw has spent much of his energy fighting
against the far left. As a student leader he campaigned against the
Communist Party, and while in parliament in the early 1980 he
helped Labor defeat extreme left-wing factions then infiltrating
the party.

Iraqi dissident denies Americans nominated him to lead opposition

 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Iraqi dissident denied Friday that he has been
singled out by America as a potential leader of a campaign to oust
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   Adnan Al-Pachachi said the claim, made by Iraqi exiles earlier
this week, was ``an outrageous lie'' designed to embarrass him and
weaken his standing among the Iraqi people.
	   Iraqi exiles had said that, in a meeting with representatives of
16 Iraqi opposition groups in London on Tuesday, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk had proposed that Al-Pachachi lead
the initiative to oust Saddam.
	   ``Nothing of the kind has happened. Mr. Indyk has never said
anything of the kind,'' Al-Pachachi said.
	   A State department official said Friday that it was up to the
Iraqis to organize themselves and that it was not for the United
States to decide who should lead them.
	   ``That is not what the role of the United States is in this
process,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``We can neither appoint nor anoint.''
	   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press bureau in
Cairo on Wednesday, Al-Pachachi did not deny that Indyk had
proposed him to reconstruct the fragmented Iraqi opposition in
exile.
	   He told the AP: ``I think this is our last chance and we should
not lose it.''
	   Al-Pachachi said Friday that he had acted as informal chair of
discussions among the Iraqis when Indyk had left the room to permit
a free discussion. The claim that Indyk proposed him as leader of a
new opposition platform was ``malicious,'' he said.
	   ``It seems to me the object of which was to embarrass me and
perhaps to weaken my standing among the Iraqi people _ and perhaps
to weaken any claim I may have, which I don't have at all,''
Al-Pachachi said.
	   He said he has no ambition to lead the Iraqi opposition, would
not accept any nomination and that he is working to secure a change
of regime in Iraq out a sense of ``duty.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has proclaimed that Saddam's ouster
is a major U.S. goal in efforts to protect U.S. interests in the
region. The U.S. Congress has allocated dlrs 97 million aid for
Iraqi dissidents.
	   ``My own impression was that the United States was not thinking
in terms of military operations conducted by Iraqis in Iraq,'' he
said. ``But rather that, in the foreseeable future, the emphasis
would be on political, diplomatic and public relations efforts to
undermine the regime of Iraq and bring about change.''
	   Al-Pachachi said such an approach would demand a ``unified and
coherent Iraqi opposition'' and that the groups assured Indyk they
would find ways to unify what is now a fragmented and divided
opposition that lacks credibility.
	   Al-Pachachi was the foreign minister in the government that was
toppled in the 1968 military coup that brought Saddam's Baath party
to power. He later became a political adviser to the president of
the United Arab Emirates.
	   He has been involved in opposition efforts to topple Saddam
since the end of the 1991 Gulf War and is widely respected among
Iraq exiles.

Eight kangaroos mauled to death in Russian zoo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ All eight kangaroos at a zoo in southern Russia _
including six expectant mothers _ were found mauled to death in
their pen Friday, zookeepers said.
	   Officials at the Rostov-on-Don Zoo suspect the animals were
killed by attack dogs incited by their trainers, the ITAR-Tass news
agency and Russia's NTV television network reported.
	   Bloody adult kangaroo carcasses lay in the snow of the pen in
footage showed on NTV. A teary-eyed zoo worker, Marina Kilovatova,
held frozen kangaroos fetuses in her hand.
	   ``For someone who works in a zoo, their animals are like their
children,'' she said.
	   Two male adults and six female adults were killed, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   The zoo in Rostov, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) south of
Moscow, was closed while police investigate the attack.
	   Zoo officials said it would cost dlrs 50,000 to replace each of
the kangaroos, NTV reported.

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ While Pete Sampras savored his historic
achievement, Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja joined Sampras and Tim
Henman Friday in the semifinals of the ATP Tour World Championship.
	   Moya, The French Open champion who had not won an indoor match
all year until this week, reached the semifinals by beating Yevgeny
Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5.
	   Corretja reached the last four by beating fellow Spaniard Albert
Costa 6-2, 6-4.
	   Sampras was not scheduled to play Friday and had the opportunity
to celebrate his unique accomplishment _ holding the No. 1 ranking
for the sixth consecutive year.
	   Moya is usually not much of a threat on indoor courts and
prefers clay, the surface on which he won the French Open, and hard
courts.
	   Although indoors, the ATP championship is played on a hard court
and Moya has done well at this elite season-ending event, reaching
the semifinals for the second consecutive year.
	   By avenging his semifinal loss to Kafelnikov last year, he
ousted the Russian from the dlrs 3.5 million tournament that
nominally brings the top eight players of the year.
	   ``I was perhaps luckier in important moments,'' Moya said. ``I
had to be like a wall, put back every ball. I was mentally stronger
than last year.''
	   Moya, No. 4 in the world, will face Henman on Saturday. Henman
is the first Briton to reach the semifinals in this event. Sampras
plays Corretja.
	   Moya's first indoor victory of the season after five defeats
came at the start of the round-robin portion, when he beat Karol
Kucera. He lost to Sampras and finished behind him in one of the
four-man groups.
	   Greg Rusedski, an alternate who came in when Andre Agassi pulled
out with a back injury, crushed his fellow British teammate Henman
6-2, 6-4.
	   Rusedski's hopes of making the semis vanished when Corretja
cruised past Costa. The two are friends and spent some time
together in the past couple of weeks playing golf and skiing.
	   ``I just wanted to put the ball in the court because he was
playing so badly,'' Corretja said. ``The good thing for me was that
he hasn't played in 25 days.
	   Sampras was assured finishing 1998 as No. 1 and breaking the
record he shared with Jimmy Connors when Marcelo Rios pulled out of
the event with a back injury. Rios was replaced by Costa.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras
said after crushing Karol Kucera 6-2, 6-1 late Thursday. Sampras
feels the record may never be broken again.
	   Other players paid tribute to Sampras.
	   ``It's amazing to be up there six years in a row,'' Moya said.
``The way he's been playing here, he's just unbeatable.''
	   ``He's proved he is the best player ever and he is playing
amazingly,'' the Spaniard said.
	   The said the record will certainly not be broken in this
generation of players. ``I don't see anyone right now who can be
No. 1 six years in a row,'' he said.
	   Rusedski said Sampras has been playing ``fabulous tennis'' here.
	   ``He looked like the No. 1 for the past 25 years easily,''
Rusedski said.
	   ``It's great to see him in the sixth year. It's going to be more
interesting if he can keep on going with that streak because he is
a great a player,'' Rusedski said.
	   ``You have to give credit to him for the way he's handled all
the pressure. he's not had the best year but he still managed to
finish No. 1, which is a tremendous result,'' he said.
	   If Sampras wins this tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the event in
1991, 1994 and the last two years.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday called
on African leaders - especially those at war in Congo - to renounce
violence and accept compromise in the quest for peace on the
strife-torn continent.
	   Speaking at a summit of African leaders in Paris, Annan said
many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance''
and that war in Congo poses the greatest challenge for the
continent.
	   ``In the Congo, as everywhere, what is needed is for all parties
irrevocably to choose peace and compromise, turning their backs on
violence and conflict,'' Annan said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, for his part, urged African
nations to do their own peacekeeping - a departure from past
practices that put the burden on France and other Western nations.
	   Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace
conference in central Africa's Great Lakes region.
	   Annan and Chirac spoke at the opening ceremony of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders are focusing on
security issues.
	   But as the summit got underway, all eyes were on Congolese
President Laurent-Desire Kabila, who crosses paths here with
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's
leader. Both Rwanda and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency
in the Congo.
	   Kabila's presence in France has been the focus of attention in
the wake of the decision by Britain's House of Lords rejecting
immunity for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   But French Prosecutors, responding to complaints by the French
Human Rights League and the International Federation of Human
Rights Leagues, ruled Friday that Kabila cannot be pursued for
human rights violations because he benefits from the customary
immunity accorded to exercising heads of state.
	   Though concrete solutions to the Congo crisis were unlikely to
emerge from the summit, participants said they hoped for progress.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
Friday he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo ``during
the month of December.''
	   And the Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared to meet
with Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila has not been optimistic, saying a pullout of Rwandan
and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition for
substantive talks on a peace settlement.
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France
Internationale, Kabila added that his allies, Angola and Zimbabwe,
``were not pushing (him) to negotiate.''
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks with French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said there had been
some progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his adversaries,
with each of the parties presenting their views.
	   ``That at least allows one to look directly at the problems,
which is a beginning,'' Colonna said.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, will be allowed to
visit Australia in January.
	   Australian Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock refused Adams a
visa in 1996 citing his association with the Irish Republican Army.
The IRA had resumed its terror campaign in Britain at the time.
	   Ruddock said Friday his department has now granted Adams a visa,
following the significant advances toward achieving peace in the
troubled British province.
	   ``Australia looks to Mr. Adams and to Sinn Fein to shoulder
their full responsibility with all other parties to ensure rapid
progress in the peace process,'' Ruddock said.
	   In a statement, Adams welcomed the decision and said he would
visit in the new year,'' Adams.
	   The statement said Adams planned ``to promote internationally
and to the substantial Irish community in Australia the need for
the speedy and full implementation of the Good Friday peace
agreement.'' It said Adams would likely stay in Australia for at
least a week.
	   Irish community leader Dennis O'Flynn welcomed the decision,
noting that Adams had already been received in the White House and
is also accepted in Britain.

On 20th anniversary, Kurd rebel movement faces choice: fighting, or

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities tightened security around the
country Friday for fear of attacks timed to the 20th anniversary of
a Kurdish rebel organization, despite the rebel leader's
declaration that the group had given up armed struggle.
	   Investigators examined the wreckage left by a bomb that blew up
a bus on a road about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Ankara,
killing four and injuring 17 early Friday. Suspicion fell on the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, blamed for similar bombings in its
war for Kurdish autonomy.
	   PKK responsibility would discredit Abdullah Ocalan's
announcement this month that the rebels would now use only peaceful
means to advance the cause of Turkey's Kurds.
	   On Friday, authorities posted extra police and military at
airports, military posts and ammunition depots.
	   Ocalan founded the PKK in 1978 to seek greater cultural rights
for Kurds, who sought official recognition as a distinct minority
and freedom to use their own language in schools and broadcasting.
	   The movement turned into a guerrilla army in 1984, launching 14
years of attacks on civilians and clashes with Turkey's army.
	   Ocalan announced a PKK change of policy shortly after his Nov.
12 arrest in Rome, where he is now awaiting a decision on his
request for political asylum.
	   ``We want to do things like the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Northern Ireland,'' Ocalan said Wednesday in Rome.
	   It was not clear if Ocalan's attempts at transforming the PKK
into a political movement will be successful _ or if his guerrillas
would heed his orders from Europe.
	   Turkish intelligence has reported that Ocalan's move away from
the region has badly hurt the PKK in terms of logistics and in the
command line, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Friday.
	   Ocalan left Syria, where he had been in hiding for years, after
Turkey threatened military action against Damascus if it did not
end its support to the rebels.
	   In Rome, Kurds marked Friday's anniversary by erecting a marble
plaque outside the military hospital where Ocalan had been detained
after his arrest.
	   The plaque proclaimed the piazza's new name to be ``Piazza
Kurdistan.''
	   The international attention to Ocalan's case could push Turkey
to review its Kurdish policy, which does not grant minority rights
to some 12 million Kurds.
	   Some non-Kurdish Turks believe the time has come to lift a ban
on the use of the Kurdish language, at least.
	   ``Let them have schools, let them have television,'' Hikmet
Cetinkaya, a columnist for daily Cumhuriyet daily. ``These are
basic human rights.''
	   The fighting has claimed some 37,000 lives and stained Turkey's
human rights record, often cited by European Union countries as an
obstacle to Turkey's full membership in the 15-nation bloc. The
conflict also blocked the economic development of the poor,
Kurdish-dominated southeast.
	   Even if the rebels have changed tactics, Turkey's influential
military seems determined to keep fighting.
	   ``This struggle will be maintained in every condition,'' Gen.
Erol Tutal declared Thursday.

	   The mystery of his death has drawn attention even outside the
tight-knit world of hackers, largely because it touches the
techno-wizardry of beating encryption codes and offers a glimpse
into the murkier side of the trade. Spies and criminals need
talented hackers, too, as espionage and black market goods become
increasingly high tech.
	   Boris' friends wonder if he had become a threat to someone on

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Back on their home ice, Russians swept the podium
Friday in the women's event at the Cup of Russia.
	   Yelena Sokolova secured her lead after the short program to win
her second event this year. Two weeks earlier she won the Nations
Cup in Germany.
	   The 18-year-old Sokolova, a rising star in Russian skating
ranks, performed to a blues number and nailed her triple
lutz-double toe loop combination and triple loop jumps. Sokolova is
the only Russian skater to fulfill a triple-triple combination this
year.
	   Julia Soldatova was in second after Friday's skating at the Cup
of Russia, the fifth event in the International Skating Union's
Grand Prix, which features Olympic-eligible skaters and is being
held in Moscow for the first time.
	   Irina Slutskaya, 19, the 1995 world junior champion and second
to Michelle Kwan in the 1998 World Championship, dropped to third.
Japan's Yuka Kanazawa placed fourth, Laetitia Hubert of France was
fifth and Anna Rechnio of Poland was sixth.
	   ``We have achieved a new level of women skating in Russia now,''
renowned Russian coach Yelena Chaikovskaya. ``There are new Olympic
champions sitting here in front of you.''
	   Russians were the first in pairs as well. World champions Yelena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze secured their success in the
short program to win the event.
	   Tamara Moskvina, their coach, is also coaching American pair
Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, who held third in the competition.
	   ``Yes, I'm coaching Russians and Americans, but it's like an
adopted child: Do you make a distinction between your own and a new
one?'' she asked reporters.
	   ``Definitely there's a competition between them, but on the ice
... they are alone. It's up to them.''
	   Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China moved from the fifth place to
the second.
	   Russian World ice dance champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov are leading in the ice dances after the original dance,
the waltz. They made their season debut two weeks ago to win the
Nations Cup in Germany.
	   The Cup concludes Saturday with free skating in the men's
competition, as well as the free dance.
	   Winners receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can accumulate points from
two of the meets to qualify for the series final in St. Petersburg,
Russia, in March. The next event is NHK Trophy in Sapporo, Japan,
in December.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After a seven-year absence, Diego Maradona
returned Friday to Italy _ and to the drug scandals that drove him
from the country.
	   Maradona stepped off the plane at Milan's airport wearing a
scarf with the colors of Napoli, the team for which he was playing
when he tested positive for cocaine in 1991.
	   Dozens of fans waving the Napoli flag were there to greet him.
	   Maradona is expected to talk in coming days with investigators
examining possible doping in Italian soccer.
	   Maradona also will demand financial compensation for an
allegedly botched drug test taken during his playing days in Italy,
his personal manager Guillermo Coppola says.
	   The Italian lab that performed the test closed last month after
accusations that it mishandled drug tests and their documentation.
The closing came during a series of investigations into drug use in
Italian soccer. Findings announced so far have cited only use of
legal performance-enhancing supplements.
	   It's not known how much money Maradona, 38, is seeking.
	   A confessed cocaine addict, Maradona has always maintained his
innocence in the 1991 suspension, saying he often took his own
private tests before matches. He charged the suspension was revenge
for Argentina's victory over Italy in the 1990 World Cup
semifinals.
	   Maradona twice was suspended for 15 months for doping
violations.
	   The first for the positive cocaine test in April 1991, which was
followed later that month by an arrest on cocaine charges in Buenos
Aires. When the suspension expired, he refused to return to Napoli
and was transfered, with heavy FIFA prodding, to Sevilla in the
Spanish first division.
	   He played less than a full season there before he returned the
Argentine first division and Newell's Old Boys.
	   At the 1994 World Cup, he was hit with his second doping
suspension, this time for test positive to what FIFA called a
``cocktail'' of stimulants.
	   When that suspension expired he attempted several comebacks with
his old club, Boca Juniors _ and even coaching stints with
Argentine clubs Deportivo Mandiyu and Racing, but never played more
than occasionally.

Mexican towns shaken by volcano

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Residents of towns near the Popocatepetl
volcano on the outskirts of Mexico City were roused from their beds
by an explosive emission of red-hot rock, civil defense officials
reported.
	   The brief eruption late Thursday tossed glowing rock as far as 2
miles (3 kilometers) from the crater and sent out a shock wave felt
in towns 10 miles (15 kms) or more from the peak, whose name means
``Smoking Mountain'' in the Aztec Indian language.
	   ``It caused a lot of concern, since the blast was felt in towns
and villages relatively far from the crater,'' Mexico state Civil
Defense director Pedro Sesin said Friday.
	   Television footage showed families sitting outside their homes
shivering in the night air Thursday, nervously watching the
volcano.
	   ``The explosion was very intense but brief. It threw
incandescent rock from two to three kilometers (one to two miles)
from the crater,'' said Roberto Meli, director of the National
Center for the Prevention of Disasters. ``It illuminated the peak
for several moments in a red glow.''
	   Several villages near the crater got a light dusting of volcanic
ash, Sesin said. While a new plume of ash, gases and water vapor
rose from the volcano Friday, experts said it had a relatively low
ash content.
	   Experts are worried about the apparently large column of lava
building inside the 18,000-foot (5,490-meter) volcano only 50 miles
(80 kms) southeast of Mexico City.
	   ``We can't say whether the volcano has released its pressure,
since there is apparently a very large amount of magma'' inside,
Meli said.
	   While the most likely outcome is another series of gas emissions
or explosions, Meli estimates there is a 1-in-10 chance that the
volcano could erupt in lava flows.
	   There is also a remote possibility _ about one chance in 100 _
that a much larger explosion could destroy part of the peak, Meli
said.
	   About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slope and another 15
million live within 50 miles (80 kms) of it. The volcano has been
active since 1994, regularly emitting gas and steam.
	   Meanwhile, the Colima volcano about 300 miles (480 kms)
southwest of Mexico City showered ash on communities as far away as
13 miles (20 kms) from the peak, local media reported. That
volcano, one of Mexico's most active, began erupting again earlier
this month, forcing the evacuation of two nearby villages.
	   The Colima Volcano or Volcan de Fuego _ ``The Volcano of Fire''
_ continues to emit a slow, semi-molten stream of lava that now
reaches about a quarter of a mile (one-half kilometer) from the
crater.

Russian TV holds contest on naming international space station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ What would you call a 16-nation, dlrs 40 billion
international space station? Orchestra? Mommy? Armageddon?
	   Those were just a few of the suggestions gathered so far by a
Russian television network holding a contest to name the new space
creature. Perhaps not surprisingly, plenty of the ideas reflected
the country's current turmoil _ and Russians' often cynical sense
of humor.
	   Individual modules of the international space station have
names. Russia kicked off the project with last week's launch of the
Zarya, or Sunrise, module. NASA will be following with the Unity
module on Dec. 3.
	   But putting a tag on the whole thing has proved a thorny issue,
as the nations involved have different ideas of what would be
appropriate. For now, the station is stuck with the inelegant
acronym ISS.
	   The contest run by the TV-6 television station has given
ordinary Russians a chance to have a say in the matter, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday. The station received several
thousand suggestions within the first day of the contest.
	   The most popular has been ``Starovoitova'' _ after Galina
Starovoitova, a liberal lawmaker and one of the few prominent women
in Russian politics, whose slaying last week shocked and galvanized
the nation.
	   Many callers suggested names highlighting the U.S.-Russian
partnership in the project, such as Duet or Tandem _ apparently
oblivious to the other participants in the space station _ or the
more pertinent Orchestra, Constellation or Accord.
	   Other ideas: Galileo, Columbus, Adam or Eve, or Yuri Gagarin,
after the first man in space, a Russian cosmonaut.
	   But Russian space officials object to any name that suggests a
beginning or a first, pointing out that their country has been
flying space stations since Salyut 1 in 1971. And naming the
station after a person goes against the Japanese tradition, which
objects to giving human names to inanimate objects.
	   Other names proposed in television contest included Mommy and
the House of Good, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Pessimists piped in with Armageddon, Babylon, and even Ivan
Susanin _ after a 17th century Russian who offered to show foreign
invaders the way to the czar's camp, but instead led them to drown
in a swamp and died together with them.
	   TV-6 plans to send the proposals to Russia's space agency, which
will offer its picks to international agencies, which still hope to
come up with a livelier name than ISS.

European stock exchange heads meet on creating united market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in 4th graf with details on issues to be discussed at
further meetings. Tightens. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The heads of eight of Europe's most powerful stock
exchanges expressed support Friday for creating a pan-European
market, the company that runs France's stock market said.
	   The Societe des Bourses Francaises, the SBF, which hosted a
meeting of European stock exchange leaders in Paris, also said a
stock alliance committee had been formed to advance the process of
creating a single European stock market.
	   ``The heads of the exchanges agreed on an agenda of further
meetings and expressed their strong commitment for the continuation
of the collective progress through the creation of an exchange
alliance committee,'' a statement by the SBF said.
	   The issues to be discussed at future meetings are expected to
include the days on which a united exchange would operate,
technology, harmonization of rules, the ways that stocks would be
listed and valued.
	   The Paris meeting came four months after the Frankfurt and
London exchanges had announced plans for the creation of an
Anglo-German market.
	   The French criticized the Anglo-German plan at the time, but
since then Paris has been seeking a way to get in on the proposed
alliance between Frankfurt and London.
	   At Friday's meeting, only the Stockholm exchange declined to
join the stock alliance committee, a decision that was not a
surprise.
	   Even before the Paris gathering, OM Gruppen AB, which owns the
Stockholm exchange had expressed skepticism about the new
pan-European exchange, saying its profit-based corporate structure
would not be compatible with the proposed European trading floor.
	   ``The first meeting was very constructive and sets a good basis
for further progress toward the common objective of creating an
efficient and accessible pan-European market,'' the SBF statement
said.
	   In recent months, Paris and the smaller European exchanges have
realized that they will be left out if they don't join the movement
toward one big European market. The new European currency, the
euro, which begins Jan. 1, 1999, has also been a major impetus
toward the creation of a pan-European market.
	   The talks Friday were attended by the heads of the exchanges of
Paris, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid,
Stockholm and Zurich.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, at a briefing on
Thursday, told reporters that the Paris Bourse, as the stock
exchange here is known, will be joining the London-Frankfurt
alliance that had been a thorn in France's side.
	   A new European stock-market company could emerge as early as
January, he said - a surprise announcement that left Paris Bourse
officials, clearly not consulted, trying to water down the
minister's remarks.
	   The reaction reflected skepticism about cobbling together a
pan-European stock exchange any time soon.

Murder or suicide? The mysterious death of a computer hacker

	   BERLIN (AP) _ He was a gifted computer whiz _ one of the best,
one who'd made the jump from illegal tinkering to the legitimate,
potentially lucrative business of making codes crack-proof from
hackers like himself.
	   But when Boris Floriciz was found hanging from a tree in a
Berlin park on Oct. 22, his belt around his neck and his feet
dragging the ground, it drew attention even outside the tight-knit
world of hackers.
	   His friends wonder whether he was caught up in the murkier side
of the trade _ one of spies, espionage and black-market criminals.
Was it suicide, as police suspect? Or homicide?
	   At 26, Floriciz seemed headed for a great future. He'd just
finished his computer science degree. International firms sought
him as a consultant. He was happy, say his friends, who cannot
believe he would take his own life.
	   Floriciz's friends wonder if he had become a threat to someone
on the wrong side of the business, leading to his death.
	   ``That was not a personal decision,'' Andy Mueller-Maguhn, a
friend and fellow member of the Chaos Computer Club said. ``For
sure not. That was murder.''
	   From childhood, Floriciz looked destined to be an engineer. He
was always taking things apart to see how they worked. ``Radios,
television, clocks, the lawn mower _ nothing was safe from him,''
his father told Stern magazine.
	   He disassembled a telephone booth to get at computer data
inside. He was the first hacker to crack the microchips on Deutsche
Telekom telephone cards, used at pay phones in Germany. His
homemade card reloaded as the credit ran out.
	   After getting caught in 1995 and sentenced to probation,
Floriciz ``felt the need to draw the line,'' said Mueller-Maguhn.
	   He joined Chaos, a 10-year-old group of computer devotees, and
he went back to college, earning his diploma in September by
developing a scrambler to encode telephone calls on high-speed,
digital lines.
	   German media reports say Floriciz also was working on cracking
decoders for pay television _ a booming business spreading across
Europe. One of the key players is Robert Murdoch, whose digital
broadcasting research firm NDS Ltd. contacted Floriciz two years
ago about being a code-design consultant.
	   ``He was an exceptionally talented engineer,'' said Margot
Field, spokeswoman at the firm's London headquarters. NDS wanted to
hire him but couldn't move forward because Floriciz hadn't yet
graduated or completed his compulsory military service. The firm's
last contact with him was in June.
	   NDS apparently wasn't the only one interested in Floriciz.
	   His father says Floriciz talked several times about being
approached by people he suspected worked for spy agencies, which
are believed to have mined the hacker world for talent in the past.
	   Just a few months ago, Germany's spy agency tried to hire a
hacker to get secrets out of Iran's military computers, the Chaos
club said. But the contact vanished when the hacker got Chaos
involved.
	   Floriciz may also have attracted black marketeers of counterfeit
chips for telephone cards and mobile phones. Deutsche Telekom
estimates it loses millions of dollars each year from counterfeit
cards. And industry officials worry that TV decoder chips offer
gangsters even bigger profits on the black market.
	   Money wasn't a lure for Floriciz, his friends say. He preferred
to post his research on the Internet for all to see _ and use.
	   ``It was all the same to him if others raked in the bucks from
what he developed,'' one friend, Daniel, told Stern. ``The main
thing for him was that he had proven what he was great at.''
	   Mueller-Maguhn says Floriciz's open attitude about his work
might have threatened those who didn't want competitors horning in
on their business.
	   ``He had lots of jobs, but he didn't want to become a slave of
one company,'' he said. ``Maybe that was a problem.''
	   Floriciz left his mother's apartment on Oct. 17 at about 2 p.m.
She didn't think he'd be gone long, because he didn't take his
laptop computer.
	   He never came back. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered.
	   A passerby found his body five days later. His phone, keys, ID
card and money were with him, evidence police say points to
suicide. No sign of a struggle. Nothing stolen. No drugs.
	   Detectives are waiting for test results _ fingerprint fragments
or chemical traces _ before making a final determination.
	   The Chaos Computer Club is putting together its own report,
which it plans to release at its annual convention Dec. 27-29 in
Berlin. Already, the death notice on the club's Web site states
what Floriciz's friends believe happened:
	   ``The circumstances under which he disappeared and his
extraordinary capabilities lead us to the conclusion that he became
a homicide victim.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican was elected Friday
as co-president of the Socialist International for Latin America
and the Caribbean, in a vote that independence advocates hailed as
a show of support for their cause.
	   At a meeting in Geneva of the global organization representing
160 social democratic parties, Sen. Ruben Berrios was chosen to
replace former Dominican leader Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, said
Fernando Martin, vice president of the Puerto Rican Independence
Party that Berrios leads. Pena Gomez died of cancer in May.
	   Martin said the election of Berrios ``constitutes a way of
honoring and supporting the cause of our independence.''
	   He said it came at an important time, when the United States is
reconsidering its relationship with the Caribbean island it
conquered 100 years ago in the Spanish-American War.
	   Puerto Ricans vote Dec. 13 on a referendum on whether they want
to join the U.S. union, become independent or retain the
commonwealth status that makes them a kind of colony of the United
States. Though the vote is not binding, President Bill Clinton has
asked the U.S. Congress to give the results serious consideration.
	   In the last referendum in 1994, commonwealth narrowly beat out
statehood and fewer than 5 percent of votes went to independence.
	   The Socialist International currently includes 13 of the 15
governing parties in Western Europe and those governing leading
Latin America countries such as Mexico and Brazil.

Hunger striking kidnappers transferred to hospital in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Seven convicted kidnappers on an
11-day hunger strike were transferred to a hospital Friday amid
concerns for their health, authorities said.
	   The kidnappers _ four Chileans, two Argentines and a Brazilian _
are demanding the court reconsider their sentences in the 1989
kidnapping of supermarket magnate Abilio Diniz.
	   Another Chilean, who had been part of the group behind the
kidnapping, was transferred to the hospital earlier in the week.
	   Last Friday, two Canadians who belonged to the group, David
Spencer and Christine Lamont, took advantage of a prisoner transfer
treaty between Canada and Brazil and were flown to a Vancouver
prison. No such treaty exists between Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
	   The kidnappers have lost an average 18 pounds (8 kilograms)
since they began their hunger strike and one of the Chileans is
suffering from a kidney infection as well, said a Sao Paulo prison
department worker who declined to be identified.
	   The Chileans and Argentines are demanding that they be returned
to their native countries and the Brazilian is demanding a pardon.
	   The court agreed to reconsider the kidnapper's sentences last
April after the kidnappers went on a 16-day hunger strike. But a
lack of movement on the matter led the kidnappers to re-start the
hunger strike.

Western oil companies threaten to pull out of Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Several major Western oil companies warned Friday
they would reduce their operations in Russia because taxes are too
high, a news report said.
	   Viktor Mashinsky, deputy chair of parliament's economic policy
committee, said after a meeting with Western oil executives that
the companies were planning to suspend their operations in Russia
pending revision of the tax system, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Executives from Occidental Petroleum, Shell, British Gas,
British Petroleum, Conoco and Total met in Moscow on Friday with
officials from Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry, Economics
Ministry and State Tax Service, Mashinsky said.
	   Occidental has already announced plans to pull out of a joint
venture in Russia's northern Komi republic.
	   Mashinsky suggested appointing a committee of Russian and
Western oil executives to draft alternative tax legislation for
Russia.
	   The report came the same day the Russian government approved a
tax reform package designed to relieve the tax burden on domestic
producers, including the country's huge oil companies.
	   It was unclear whether the oil executives' comments came before
or after the government's decision.
	   Russia's oil exports _ the country's largest source of
hard-currency revenues _ have been hit hard by falling world crude
prices and the country's latest economic crisis.

Iraq asks inspectors to clarify issues but attacks U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq reacted positively to several
requests by the U.N. weapons inspector to resolve outstanding
issues but rejected other U.N. demands and alleged that deadly VX
nerve agent was planted on an Iraqi warhead to discredit Baghdad.
	   The Iraqis didn't indentify who may have been responsible for
planting the nerve agent on the warhead fragment, taken from Iraq
last May. But they intimated that it was either the United States
or the weapons inspectors themselves.
	   In three letters to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler,
Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi responded to
Butler's questions about his country's chemical weapons and missile
programs _ including its efforts to produce VX gas.
	   The responses reflected Baghdad's determination to comply with
inspectors' requests that it deems legitimate in its quest for a
declaration of Iraqi disarmament, the key condition for lifting a
debilitating economic embargo.
	   But they also reflected continued defiance on issues Baghdad
feels it has already answered or are outside the mandate of U.N.
inspectors.
	   Last week, Butler sent Iraq three letters seeking papers and
detailed information about its weapons of mass destruction in one
of the first major tests of Baghdad's Nov.14 pledge to resume full
cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, have resumed their own monitoring.
	   In the letters Friday, al-Qaisi asked UNSCOM to help Iraq
investigators look into three unresolved issued that Butler had
cited.
	   Al-Qaisi asked that teams be sent to investigate the fate of 155
millimeter shells filled with mustard gas, to verify the disposal
of R-400 aerial bombs equipped for chemical and biological agents,
and to look at pits where special warheads were stored.
	   At the same time, however, he refused to hand over
Iraqi-produced missile engine components extracted from the Tigris
River canal for analysis, saying Butler's request was not justified
``on technical or scientific grounds.''
	   ``The letters are being studied,'' U.N. inspectors' spokesman
Ewen Buchanan.
	   The chief weapons inspector also had asked Iraq in a Nov. 19
letter for an explanation of the presence of decayed VX nerve agent
on missile warhead fragments tested at a U.S. Army laboratory in
June, and on chemical residues found in one fragment tested at a
French laboratory that could be from VX or other nerve agents.
	   Al-Qaisi alleged that the nerve agent was planted on the warhead
fragment in order to discredit Baghdad's efforts to comply with
U.N. mandates.
	   ``The incontrovertible facts are that Iraq never produced VX in
stable form and never filled VX in warheads,'' al-Qaisi said. ``At
the same time, it is also an incontrovertible fact that Iraq filled
three aerial bombs of 500 caliber in 1988 for compatibility tests,
with the results that the VX degraded within a short period.''
	   He said that because those were the only VX tests, there was no
way that fragments from Al-Hussein missile warheads could be
contaminated with VX at any time.
	   ``The straightforward answer from Iraq's point of view, is that
the contamination could not but have been the result of a
deliberate act of tampering with the first set of samples taken out
from Iraq to the United States on May 8, 1998,'' al-Qaisi said.
	   He claimed that UNSCOM took the sample fragments to the United
States for testing over Baghdad's protests.
	   Butler said he had to send the fragments to the U.S. Army
laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland, because it was the only facility
that could guarantee results in 30 days, which he said was an Iraqi
condition for allowing the fragments to be removed.
	   The Iraqis did comply with Butler's request for the results of
their own tests on missile fragments taken in July 1998.
	   Al-Qaisi said a 42-page report, dated Sept. 10, was sent
Thursday to UNSCOM's Monitoring and Verification Center in Baghdad.
He did not disclose the results.
	   In its first response to Butler's requests, Iraq last week
accused him of asking for documents that don't exist or aren't
relevant to UNSCOM's work. Baghdad also insisted that it handed
over all documents on its biological weapons program _ which Butler
calls ``a black hole'' _ in 1995.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Gloria Fuertes, Spain's most popular author
of poetry for children, died in hospital Friday from lung cancer.
She was aged 80.
	   Fuertes, born in Madrid in 1918, was admitted to hospital
earlier this week with serious respiratory problems. She had been
diagnosed as having lung cancer two months ago, national radio
said.
	   Spanish Nobel literature prizewinner Camilo Jose Cela described
Fuertes as ``one of the most solid voices of Spanish poetry of all
time.''
	   Fuertes published more than a dozen books of songs and poems for
children, her first, `La Isla Ignorada '(The Unknown Island)
appearing in 1950. She also presented a very popular children's
program for Spanish national television, ``Un Globo, Dos Globos,
Tres Globos '' (One Balloon, Two Balloons, Three Balloons) in the
1970s.
	   In 1960 she was given a Fullbright scholarship and taught
Spanish Literature in Bucknell University in Pennsylvania up to
1963, the national news agency Efe said.
	   She is to be buried in Madrid on Saturday. It was not
immediately known if she had any surviving relatives.

Iraq to reject non-weapons requests by UNSCOM

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq says it will turn down any request by
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that is unrelated to
disarmament or that jeopardizes the country's security.
	   In a television interview broadcast late Thursday, Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Baghdad also rejects the
five conditions set by U.S. President Bill Clinton after calling
off the Nov. 14 military strikes on Iraq.
	   Sahhaf said the government is committed only to a U.N.
resolution that links the removal of sanctions to a certification
by U.N. weapons inspectors that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.
	   ``This wretched person (Butler) now thinks he has the backing of
the United States of America in accordance with the points raised
by its president,'' Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq evaded the military strikes by allowing the resumption of
inspections by the United Nations Special Commission after a
two-week hiatus.
	   Sahhaf said Butler and the United States are mistaken if they
believe Iraq's decision to cooperate s gives them the right to
obtain ``a yes'' answer from Iraq to every demand.
	   But Sahhaf was quick to add that Iraq is committed to
cooperating with UNSCOM.
	   Cooperation with the inspectors was one of the five conditions
that Clinton laid out in calling off the strikes. Clinton also said
that Iraq must turn over all relevant documents; accept all U.N.
resolutions regarding its weapons of mass destruction; resolve all
outstanding issues raised by the inspectors and give them
unfettered access to sites.
	   Soon after UNSCOM resumed its work in Iraq, Butler asked for
papers that he says are related to Iraq's biological and chemical
weapons programs.
	   Iraq says most of the documents in question do not exist and
those in its possession will not be handed over because they are
part of its national security.
	   ``Butler has resorted to a new ploy: that is the implementation
of the points made by Clinton,'' Sahhaf said.
	   He said a deal his government signed with U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan in February compels Butler and his inspectors to respect
``all of Iraq's national security concerns'' in addition to matters
related to its sovereignty.
	   The Feb. 23 pact opened presidential sites to the inspectors and
had also averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   On Friday, more U.N. inspectors arrived in Baghdad as others
went out on field trips to ensure that no illegal activities are
taking place at suspected Iraqi weapons sites.

Couples says golf's money is `peanuts' compared to baseball
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ For a lot more money, Fred Couples
would be really friendly with golf fans.
	   Give him the dkrs 87.5 million the New York Yankees baseball
team are paying Bernie Williams over seven years and Couples would
walk outside the ropes, smile and wave in between shots.
	   ``I'd go to tournaments and hold hands,'' he said Friday.
	   Instead, Couples, Greg Norman, defending champion Tom Lehman and
Mark O'Meara have to settle for the dlrs 1 million at stake in the
Skins Game beginning Saturday at Rancho La Quinta Country Club.
	   This year, Couples has earned more than dlrs 1.6 million, a
career best, with two victories in 17 tournaments. He played a
limited schedule that allowed him to rest an ailing back.
	   ``I feel like I had a great, great year,'' he said. ``In other
sports, it's peanuts. It's ridiculous an owner can pay somebody
dlrs 90 million for seven years.''
	   Couples figures it costs him thousands of dollars to travel to
the Masters and the British Open.
	   ``You've already spent dlrs 12,000 or dlrs 20,000 before you
even hit a first putt and everyone wants you to smile and have a
good time,'' he said.
	   So Couples is very happy to see the PGA Tour boosting prize
money to dlrs 131 million in 1999, an increase of dlrs 35 million.
	   ``Golf has really taken off,'' he said. ``I honestly think that
we deserve it.''
	   Couples, in his 17th year on Tour, recalled Jack Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer earning less than dlrs 100,000 a year when they ruled
golf.
	   ``I've got to be honest, if I played 18 or 19 years and averaged
dlrs 200,000 or dlrs 300,000 or dlrs 400,000 a year, I think it
would be a long, long career,'' he said.
	   The Skins Game, in its 16th year, is the richest ever. This
year's purse is up 67 percent over the dlrs 600,000 offered last
year when Lehman won 10 skins worth dlrs 300,000 to set a Skins
rookie record.
	   ``It was pretty amazing (what Lehman did),'' said O'Meara, who
won five skins and dlrs 240,000 to finish second last year.
``That's probably going to happen this year. You've got to make a
lot of birdies and make them at the right time.''
	   Lehman had six birdies in shooting an unofficial 61 in the
18-hole tournament played over two days.
	   ``There's pressure, excitement and fun,'' said Lehman, who has
earned dlrs 1 million this season despite not winning a tournament.
``The course kind of lends itself to a lot of aggressive play.''
	   Each of the first six holes on the 7,011-yard, par-71 course
will be worth dlrs 25,000. Holes 7-12 will be worth dlrs 50,000,
holes 13-17 are worth dlrs 70,000, while the 18th hole is worth
dlrs 200,000.
	   Couples withdrew from last year's Skins because of the death of
his father. He's always done well in the event, winning twice and
leading the Skins money list with dlrs 1.1 million and skins won
(38) in five previous appearances.
	   ``What you need to do is make as many birdies as you can,'' he
said. ``The first day you try to get in position to win a skin. The
second day ... you get this rush, you need to make (putts) just to
keep going. The pressure mounts quite a bit.''
	   Norman is in the early stages of a comeback from shoulder
surgery. He won his own Shark Shootout tournament last month in his
first event since being sidelined nearly seven months. He earned
dlrs 200,000 in two previous Skins appearances, the last in 1992.

Reputed chief of Quebec's Hells Angels acquitted in prison guard

killings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The man who police say is the leader of Quebec's
Hells Angels was acquitted Friday on charges that he ordered the
killings of two prison guards.
	   The verdict, after two days of jury deliberations, was greeted
by whoops of joy from Hells Angels members and supporters who
gathered at the Montreal courthouse in a show of solidarity for
Maurice ``Mom'' Boucher.
	   The case against Boucher, 45, hinged on testimony from Stephane
Gagne, 28, who admitted being a part of two-man hit teams that shot
prison guards Diane Lavigne and Pierre Rondeau in separate attacks
last year.
	   Gagne said the attacks were ordered by Boucher as part of a
campaign to intimidate the criminal justice system.
	   Many Hells Angels have been arrested in the Montreal area in the
past several years as police tried to counter a tit-for-tat war
with a rival motorcycle gang, the Rock Machine, for control of
Quebec's illegal drug trade.
	   More than 50 people have been killed in gang-related bombings
and shootings in the area since 1994, including an 11-year-old boy
killed by a car bomb.
	   During Boucher's trial, chief prosecutor Jacques Dagenais
presented documents on the structure of the Hells Angels, as well
as telephone conversations he said confirmed Boucher as the
mastermind behind the attacks on the guards.
	   However, Judge Jean-Guy Boilard told jurors they should convict
Boucher only if they believed Gagne, who admitted to past lies and
double-crosses.
	   Boucher, who awaited trial in an otherwise empty and highly
secure wing of a women's prison, said nothing as he walked out of
the courtroom after the verdict. He was met by celebrating friends,
then left in a station wagon waiting outside.

	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ With Stefan Eberharter leading the way,
Austria reasserted the dominance it displayed all last season,
sweeping the top five places Friday in the opening super-G of the
1998-99 World Cup ski season.
	   Eberharter, 29, continued his spectacular early-season skiing
with a run of 1 minute, 11.81 seconds _ more than a half-second
faster than runner-up Hermann Maier, the defending World Cup
overall, super-G and giant slalom champion who finished in 1:12.33.
	   Christian Mayer came out of the second seed to finish third in
1:12.45 but relinquished the World Cup overall lead to Eberharter,
whose 100-point victory gave him a 280-250 advantage.
	   Rainer Salzgeber, another second-seeded Austrian, was fourth in
1:12.49, and Hans Knauss completed the Austrian dominance by
placing fifth in 1:12.85.
	   Eberharter, the Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom, won a
giant slalom last Friday in Park City, Utah, and was second to
Maier in a season-opening giant slalom last month in Soelden,
Austria.
	   Winless in his World Cup career until he captured a
season-ending giant slalom last March, Eberharter now has won three
of his last four starts.
	   ``I made a mistake on top and that made me angry,'' Eberharter
said. ``After that, I had a perfect race.
	   ``It was a very difficult super-G, maybe the most difficult we
will have this season. Hermann is the champion from last year, so
he is the man to beat. Today, I was the lucky one.''
	   Austrian men also swept the first five places in a World Cup
downhill at Beaver Creek last December and claimed the top four
spots four other times in leading the men's and women's teams to a
record 13,566 points.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus was sixth in 1:12.89, France's Jean-Luc
Cretier placed seventh in 1:12.99, and Switzerland's Steve Locher
was eighth in 1:13.06. Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway was ninth in
1:13.07.
	   Casey Puckett was the top American, placing 12th in 1:13.34 in
his first World Cup super-G race.
	   His brother, Chris Puckett, missed the race. Puckett suffered a
hairline fracture of his right tibia when he fell during training
on Thursday.
	   Both Maier and Mayer professed to be amazed at their second- and
third-place finishes.
	   ``I had the wrong skis,'' Maier said. ``I had skis for soft
snow, but it was icy up there. I made a lot of mistakes. It was the
roughest race of my whole career. Second place is like a victory
for me. What I did, it's unbelievable.''
	   Mayer said he hoped to finish in the top 10 of the race. ``Top
three is amazing to me,'' he said. ``I had trained only two days
for super-G. I think this is the most difficult super-G I've ever
skied in.''
	   Aspen, once a regular stop on the World Cup circuit, is the site
of World Cup races for the first time since 1995. A men's slalom
will be contested here on Saturday.

Dortmund and Hertha win again in Bundesliga
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund and Hertha Berlin continued
their march up the Bundesliga table Friday by sweeping to another
victory.
	   Dortmund, with Lars Ricken setting up the first two goals, slid
past Eintracht Frankfurt 3-1 in front of 67,000 spectators at
Westfalenstadium.
	   Berlin, a force at home in Olympiastadium, won an away match for
the first time this season. Sixten Veit scored in the 5lst and
striker Michael Preetz four minutes later.
	   Dortmund, with midfielders Andreas Moeller and Thomas Haessler
finally harmonizing together, remained in fifth place. Berlin rose
to sixth as both closed a huge gap with the teams above them in the
table.
	   Dortmund, winning it's sixth straight at home, is now just two
points back of fourth-place Kaiserslautern, which plays Sunday.
Berlin is four back.
	   Ricken crossed to Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat in the 14th
minute, who punched in a short goal.
	   Although Ralf Weber equalized for Frankfurt in the 53rd minute,
Ricken dropped a long pass in the path of Bachirou Salou 10 minutes
later and Moeller added the final score in the 75th.
	   Berlin came into the match having dealt first place Bayern
Munich a 1-0 loss last week, a victory that finally turned the
Bundesliga into a race.
	   But Rostock, winless in seven matches, dominated at home in a
foggy stadium until Berlin stunned them with the two quick goals.
Egypt's Yassar Radwan gave the port club a late consolation goal.

led her country to a domination of the event in this Rocky Mountain
resort.
	   Goetschl, 23, blazed down the soft course, which has been
covered in new snow the past two days, in a time of one minute
36.12 seconds.
	   Italy's Isolde Kostner was second with a time of 1:36.43.
	   Goetschl's Austrian teammate Alexandra Meissnitzer finished
third in a time of 1:36.64. Austrians took three of the top six
placings.
	   The win was a first for Goetschl at Lake Louise, where she
finished third last year.
	   It was her third first-place downhill finish.

	   SIACUALAYA, Honduras (AP) _ After Hurricane Mitch's flood waters
washed away their crops and tools, residents of the isolated jungle
village of Siacualaya could do little more than wait for help to
arrive.
	   They waited for the food that would allow them to feed their
children, the seeds that would let them become self-sufficient
again and the tools to rebuild the thatched-roof huts destroyed in
the storm.
	   Four weeks later, they are still waiting. Despite massive
international aid for hurricane victims, little has trickled down
to the Miskito Indians who live in Siacualaya _ pronounced
shak-wah-LIE-uh _ and other tiny, remote villages along the Cruta
River deep in the northeastern Honduran jungle.
	   The only assistance the village has received came Thursday, when
a public health worker, Carol Enrique Figueroa Peri, gave villagers
chlorine and taught them how to use it to purify river water.
	   ``All the food is in the cities. Here, nothing. And here the
people are suffering most,'' Figueroa said.
	   Officials in the provincial capital, Puerto Lempira, say
villagers will soon receive their first food shipment. They said
aid has been delayed by a lack of supplies and transportation
problems.
	   Few roads exist in the province. The capital can be reached only
by air or sea and villages like Siacualaya are accessible only by
small boat and, in some cases, by helicopter.
	   Private organizations have delivered aid to the Miskito region,
but the mayor for the area, Ismael Curbelo, said they are not
coordinating deliveries with his office, and some villages have
been left with nothing.
	   Residents say they need enough food to carry them over until
they can plant and harvest their own crops _ a process that could
take three months if they get seeds right away and longer if they
don't. Even the fish have stopped biting in the rivers, residents
say.
	   ``The people are going to die of hunger,'' said Demetria Perez.
	   Perez's tone was more of resignation than desperation. The
Miskito Indians are used to hardship. Honduras is one of the
poorest countries in the hemisphere, and the Miskito region is one
of the poorest parts of the country.
	   The area where she lives never had electricity, telephone
service or water wells. Residents live off their crops and the
river. Little money ever changes hands. They speak their own
language and have little contact with the rest of the country. A
trip to the nearest hospital, in Puerto Lempira, can take days in a
dugout canoe, the main form of transportation.
	   Hurricane Mitch has made life even harder. The storm, which
officials say killed more than 7,000 people in Honduras alone,
killed only seven in the province that includes the Miskito region,
Gracias a Dios _ Spanish for ``Thanks to God.''
	   But about two-thirds of the province's 55,000 residents were
affected by the storm, many with their homes damaged or destroyed.
In Siacualaya and other villages, most residents fled to shelters
in other communities where they have received aid.
	   Hundreds more, though, refused to leave, not wanting to abandon
their houses and the farm animals that survived the flood.
	   Village residents say they have run out of the rice and beans
that are the staple of their diet and are eating mostly filipitas,
a banana-like fruit that Figueroa said is low in nutrition. They
said they will soon run out of the filipitas as well and may have
to slaughter the last of their pigs and chickens.
	   Health problems are also growing. Many Miskitos suffer from
diarrhea after drinking water from a now contaminated river. The
thick mud on the banks provides a breeding ground for
disease-carrying mosquitos. And with many homes destroyed, several
families are crowded into each house, speeding the spread of
respiratory ailments and other contagious illnesses.
	   In Tikiuraya, a community near Siacualaya, Honduran nurse
McDowell Granwell attends to patients from 12 communities. With no
doctors around, he treats the sick as best he can and teaches them
about the importance of using chlorine in water.
	   But he knows there are limits to what he can do. Compounding the
health problems is the malnutrition, exacerbated since Hurricane
Mitch, which lowers the body's defenses.
	   ``It's really difficult,'' he said. ``The villagers are asking
me 'When is the help going to get here?'''

	   LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) _ Norway's Bjarte Engen Vik had jumps
of 99 and 95.5 meters Friday, earning a more than one minute head
start in Saturday's 10-kilometer cross-country ski in a World Cup
Nordic combined event.
	   Russian Dmitri Zinitzyn, who had jumps of 98.5 and 93 meters,
will start second behind Engen Vik, 66 seconds behind and 15
seconds ahead of World Cup leader Hannu Manninen of Finland.
	   Engen Vik had jumps of 99 and 99.5 meters.
	   ``This was two very good jumps, and best of the season for me.
It's going to be great fun in the cross country competition
Saturday, and I hope to place first,'' Engen Vik told Norwegian
news agency NTB.

	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ With Stefan Eberharter leading the way,
Austria reasserted the dominance it displayed all last season,
sweeping the top five places Friday in the opening super-G of the
1998-99 World Cup ski season.
	   Eberharter, 29, continued his spectacular early-season skiing
with a run of 1 minute, 11.81 seconds _ more than a half-second
faster than runner-up Hermann Maier, the defending World Cup
overall, super-G and giant slalom champion who finished in 1:12.33.
	   Christian Mayer came out of the second seed to finish third in
1:12.45 but relinquished the World Cup overall lead to Eberharter,
whose 100-point victory gave him a 280-250 advantage.
	   Rainer Salzgeber, another second-seeded Austrian, was fourth in
1:12.49, and Hans Knauss completed the Austrian dominance by
placing fifth in 1:12.85.
	   Eberharter, the Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom, won a
giant slalom last Friday in Park City, Utah, and was second to
Maier in a season-opening giant slalom last month in Soelden,
Austria.
	   Winless in his World Cup career until he captured a
season-ending giant slalom last March, Eberharter now has won three
of his last four starts.
	   ``I made a mistake on top and that made me angry,'' Eberharter
said. ``After that, I had a perfect race.
	   ``It was a very difficult super-G, maybe the most difficult we
will have this season. Hermann is the champion from last year, so
he is the man to beat. Today, I was the lucky one.''
	   Austrian men also swept the first five places in a World Cup
downhill at Beaver Creek last December and claimed the top four
spots four other times in leading the men's and women's teams to a
record 13,566 points.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus was sixth in 1:12.89, France's Jean-Luc
Cretier placed seventh in 1:12.99, and Switzerland's Steve Locher
was eighth in 1:13.06. Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway was ninth in
1:13.07.
	   Casey Puckett was the top American, placing 12th in 1:13.34 in
his first World Cup super-G race.
	   His brother, Chris Puckett, missed the race. Puckett suffered a
hairline fracture of his right tibia when he fell during training
on Thursday.
	   Both Maier and Mayer professed to be amazed at their second- and
third-place finishes.
	   ``I had the wrong skis,'' Maier said. ``I had skis for soft
snow, but it was icy up there. I made a lot of mistakes. It was the
roughest race of my whole career. Second place is like a victory
for me. What I did, it's unbelievable.''
	   Mayer said he hoped to finish in the top 10 of the race. ``Top
three is amazing to me,'' he said. ``I had trained only two days
for super-G. I think this is the most difficult super-G I've ever
skied in.''
	   Aspen, once a regular stop on the World Cup circuit, is the site
of World Cup races for the first time since 1995. A men's slalom
will be contested here on Saturday.

Murder or suicide? The mysterious death of a computer hacker

	   BERLIN (AP) _ He was a gifted computer whiz _ one of the best,
one who'd made the jump from illegal tinkering to the legitimate,
potentially lucrative business of making codes crack-proof from
hackers like himself.
	   But when Boris Floriciz was found hanging from a tree in a
Berlin park on Oct. 22, his belt around his neck and his feet
dragging the ground, it drew attention even outside the tight-knit
world of hackers.
	   His friends wonder whether he was caught up in the murkier side
of the trade _ one of spies, espionage and black-market criminals.
Was it suicide, as police suspect? Or homicide?
	   At 26, Floriciz seemed headed for a great future. He'd just
finished his computer science degree. International firms sought
him as a consultant. He was happy, say his friends, who cannot
believe he would take his own life.
	   Floriciz's friends wonder if he had become a threat to someone
on the wrong side of the business, leading to his death.
	   ``That was not a personal decision,'' Andy Mueller-Maguhn, a
friend and fellow member of the Chaos Computer Club said. ``For
sure not. That was murder.''
	   From childhood, Floriciz looked destined to be an engineer. He
was always taking things apart to see how they worked. ``Radios,
television, clocks, the lawn mower _ nothing was safe from him,''
his father told Stern magazine.
	   He disassembled a telephone booth to get at computer data
inside. He was the first hacker to crack the microchips on Deutsche
Telekom telephone cards, used at pay phones in Germany. His
homemade card reloaded as the credit ran out.
	   After getting caught in 1995 and sentenced to probation,
Floriciz ``felt the need to draw the line,'' said Mueller-Maguhn.
	   He joined Chaos, a 10-year-old group of computer devotees, and
he went back to college, earning his diploma in September by
developing a scrambler to encode telephone calls on high-speed,
digital lines.
	   German media reports say Floriciz also was working on cracking
decoders for pay television _ a booming business spreading across
Europe. One of the key players is Rupert Murdoch, whose digital
broadcasting research firm NDS Ltd. contacted Floriciz two years
ago about being a code-design consultant.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq says it will turn down any request by
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that is unrelated to
disarmament or that jeopardizes the country's security.
	   In a television interview broadcast late Thursday, Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf also said he rejected conditions
set by U.S. President Bill Clinton after the United States called
off military strikes on Iraq on Nov. 14.
	   The White House replied that the conditions set out by Clinton
were not new, but a reiteration of Iraq's longstanding commitments
	   Iraq evaded the military strikes by allowing the resumption of
inspections by the United Nations Special Commission after a
two-week hiatus.
	   Sahhaf said his government was committed only to a U.N.
resolution that links the removal of sanctions to a certification
by U.N. weapons inspectors that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.
	   ``This wretched person (Butler) now thinks he has the backing of
the United States of America in accordance with the points raised
by its president,'' Sahhaf said.
	   Cooperation with the inspectors was one of the five conditions
that Clinton laid out in calling off the strikes. Clinton also said
that Iraq must turn over all relevant documents; accept all U.N.
resolutions regarding its weapons of mass destruction; resolve all
outstanding issues raised by the inspectors and give them
unfettered access to sites.
	   White House spokesman P. J. Crowley, speaking to reporters in
Washington, said the conditions are not new.
	   ``Quite simply, we expect Iraq to cooperate with UNSCOM and
comply fully with all relevant Security Council resolutions.'' he
said.
	   Soon after UNSCOM resumed its work in Iraq, Butler asked for
papers that he says are related to Iraq's biological and chemical
weapons programs.
	   Iraq says most of the documents in question do not exist and
those in its possession will not be handed over because they are
part of its national security.
	   ``Butler has resorted to a new ploy: that is the implementation
of the points made by Clinton,'' Sahhaf said.
	   He said a deal his government signed with U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan in February compels Butler and his inspectors to respect
``all of Iraq's national security concerns'' in addition to matters
related to its sovereignty.
	   Sahhaf said Butler and the United States are mistaken if they
believe Iraq's decision to cooperates gives them the right to
obtain ``a yes'' answer from Iraq to every demand.
	   The Feb. 23 pact opened presidential sites to the inspectors and
had also averted U.S. and British air strikes.
	   On Friday, more U.N. inspectors arrived in Baghdad as others
went out on field trips to ensure that no illegal activities are
taking place at suspected Iraqi weapons sites.

Portugal and Indonesia to meet again on autonomy for East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Indonesia and Portugal are moving closer
to an agreement to give East Timor wide-ranging autonomy and will
meet again in February, a U.N. envoy said Friday.
	   Ambassador Jamsheed Marker said two days of talks this week,
which he called very constructive and businesslike, focused on the
formal responses of the Portuguese and Indonesian governments to an
autonomy proposal submitted by the United Nations in October.
	   ``We have presented a very elaborate autonomy proposal to both
the governments. They have to have time to study it,'' he said.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it the following year. The United Nations and Portugal do
not recognize Indonesia's claim to East Timor.
	   In August, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his
Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama agreed to set aside the difficult
issue of the final status of East Timor and enter into discussions
on possible wide-ranging autonomy.
	   Indonesia wants autonomy to be final _ but East Timorese
pro-independence groups are demanding a referendum to decide the
territory's future.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to break the
longstanding deadlock over East Timor, said he wasn't disappointed
that an autonomy agreement would not be reached by the end of the
year, as Alatas and Gama had hoped.
	   ``I think we've gone a long way towards the autonomy process.
These are very complicated and difficult matters,'' Marker said.
``I think we have some very sound proposals, and that they will
find a positive response, hopefully from all sides.''
	   He said he had not set a deadline for an agreement.
	   During this week's talks, ``the various areas of autonomy were
extensively discussed and the two sides now have a better
understanding of each other's positions on specific issues,'' he
said.
	   Indonesian representative Nugroho Wisnumurti and Portugese
delegate Fernando Neves also finalized the text of the agreement to
establish diplomatic interest sections between their governments,
the U.N. envoy said.
	   To advance the process towards an early agreement on autonomy,
Marker said he plans to visit Indonesia on Dec. 16. He was in
Portugal two weeks ago and also met representatives of the East
Timorese resistance to inform them of progress in the talks and
ensure that their views were channeled into the three-way talks.
	   Marker said a U.N. official will travel to Indonesia and East
Timor next week to continue intensified consultations with East
Timorese leaders.
	   The next round of talks with senior officials will take place
from Feb. 1-5, preceded by a meeting of a smaller working group
which will tackle economic issues related to autonomy, Marker said.

Dissident's trial sets off demonstration in Havana

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Dissidents protesting the trial of an independent
journalist were surrounded by shouting government supporters
outside a Havana courthouse on Friday, setting off a rare street
disturbance in the heart of the Cuban capital.
	   Reporters saw at least five people, apparently all dissidents,
carried away by police during the incident in front of the
Capitolio, Cuba's former capital building.
	   The 20-minute disturbance was one of the most public outbursts
in Havana since a clash between thousands of Communist Party
militants and protesters near Havana's Malecon waterfront in 1994.
	   About a dozen dissidents had came to support Mario Viera, 59,
the head of the tiny and unauthorized Cuba Verdad press agency. He
was to go on trial Friday on charges of defaming a government
official in an article posted over the Cubanet Internet site.
	   Apparently attracted by the television cameras focused on Viera,
supporters behind him began loudly chanting the Christian ``Our
Father'' prayer. One shouted, ``Long Live Mario, who defends the
liberty of Cubans.''
	   That rapidly attracted government supporters, some shaking,
apparently with rage. ``I am a Cuban! I am a revolutionary!'' Marta
Ofelia Cuallo Portuondo shouted at the dissidents and television
crews.
	   Other people walked up _ one carrying a Cuban flag _ and began
shouting at the dissidents. ``Viva Fidel!'' cried one man.
	   One man lurched out and slapped at Norberto Miranda of the small
College of Pedagogues organization, then chased Miranda down the
street.
	   Police and dozens of onlookers followed and journalists saw
police take away Miranda, one of them kicking him. Others were
removed as well.
	   Jose Dionisio Peraza, a Foreign Ministry official, had filed a
complaint charging that Viera had defamed him with an article,
``Morality in Underwear,'' ridiculing his statements before a
conference in Rome on a proposed international criminal court.
	   Viera said that Peraza insisted that the court be independent,
but that Cuban courts themselves ``are neither independent nor
impartial.'' Cuban officials insist that their courts are both.
	   The Cuban Foreign Ministry on Thursday distanced itself from the
case, saying it was a private affair between Peraza and Viera.
	   Viera's attorney, Jose Angel Izquierdo, said Friday evening that
the trial had been postponed following the demonstration. He said
he hoped it could take place by the year's end.
	   If convicted, Viera said he could receive one year in prison,
with an additional six months if he refuses to retract his
statement.
	   Viera said he lost his job as an agronomist in 1988 because of
his political beliefs, and was twice imprisoned on charges of
trying to leave the country illegally without a required permit,
for one year in 1991 and for two in 1994.

Iraq reacts positively to some U.N. demands, rejects others
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 3 with White House comments; inserts dropped
word in graf 12 &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq reacted positively to several
requests by the U.N. weapons inspector to resolve outstanding
issues but rejected other U.N. demands and alleged that deadly VX
nerve agent was planted on an Iraqi warhead to discredit Baghdad.
	   The Iraqis didn't identify who may have been responsible for
planting the nerve agent on the warhead fragment, taken from Iraq
last May. But they intimated that it was either the United States
or the weapons inspectors themselves.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said: ``The VX
findings were validated by a distinguished panel of international
experts. We stand by these findings. Any suggestion that we
tampered with those findings is absolutely false.''
	   In three letters to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler,
Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi responded to
Butler's questions about his country's chemical weapons and missile
programs _ including its efforts to produce VX gas.
	   The responses reflected Baghdad's determination to comply with
inspectors' requests that it deems legitimate in its quest for a
declaration of Iraqi disarmament, the key condition for lifting a
debilitating economic embargo.
	   But they also reflected continued defiance on issues Baghdad
feels it has already answered or are outside the mandate of U.N.
inspectors.
	   Last week, Butler sent Iraq three letters seeking papers and
detailed information about its weapons of mass destruction in one
of the first major tests of Baghdad's Nov.14 pledge to resume full
cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, have resumed their own monitoring.
	   In the letters Friday, al-Qaisi asked UNSCOM to help Iraq
investigators look into three unresolved issued that Butler had
cited.
	   Al-Qaisi asked that teams be sent to investigate the fate of 155
millimeter shells filled with mustard gas, to verify the disposal
of R-400 aerial bombs equipped for chemical and biological agents,
and to look at pits where special warheads were stored.
	   At the same time, however, he refused to hand over
Iraqi-produced missile engine components extracted from the Tigris
River canal for analysis, saying Butler's request was not justified
``on technical or scientific grounds.''
	   ``The letters are being studied,'' said U.N. inspectors'
spokesman Ewen Buchanan.
	   The chief weapons inspector also had asked Iraq in a Nov. 19
letter for an explanation of the presence of decayed VX nerve agent
on missile warhead fragments tested at a U.S. Army laboratory in
June, and on chemical residues found in one fragment tested at a
French laboratory that could be from VX or other nerve agents.
	   Al-Qaisi alleged that the nerve agent was planted on the warhead
fragment in order to discredit Baghdad's efforts to comply with
U.N. mandates.
	   ``The incontrovertible facts are that Iraq never produced VX in
stable form and never filled VX in warheads,'' al-Qaisi said. ``At
the same time, it is also an incontrovertible fact that Iraq filled
three aerial bombs of 500 caliber in 1988 for compatibility tests,
with the results that the VX degraded within a short period.''
	   He said that because those were the only VX tests, there was no
way that fragments from Al-Hussein missile warheads could be
contaminated with VX at any time.
	   ``The straightforward answer from Iraq's point of view, is that
the contamination could not but have been the result of a
deliberate act of tampering with the first set of samples taken out
from Iraq to the United States on May 8, 1998,'' al-Qaisi said.
	   He claimed that UNSCOM took the sample fragments to the United
States for testing over Baghdad's protests.
	   Butler said he had to send the fragments to the U.S. Army
laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland, because it was the only facility
that could guarantee results in 30 days, which he said was an Iraqi
condition for allowing the fragments to be removed.
	   The Iraqis did comply with Butler's request for the results of
their own tests on missile fragments taken in July 1998.
	   Al-Qaisi said a 42-page report, dated Sept. 10, was sent
Thursday to UNSCOM's Monitoring and Verification Center in Baghdad.
He did not disclose the results.
	   In its first response to Butler's requests, Iraq last week
accused him of asking for documents that don't exist or aren't
relevant to UNSCOM's work. Baghdad also insisted that it handed
over all documents on its biological weapons program _ which Butler
calls ``a black hole'' _ in 1995.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK _ Stocks rose Friday in a shortened post-Thanksgiving
session, lifting the Nasdaq market back to record levels, as a
sudden spurt of merger activity continued with word of talks
between Exxon and Mobil. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
18.80 points to 9,333.08, about 41 points below the new record of
9,374.27 set on Monday. While a few days late, the Nasdaq composite
index joined the Wall Street's renewed assault on record terrain,
jumping more than 30 points to top its previous best close of
2,014.50, set back on July 20. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. confirmed Friday
that they are talking about a possible merger that would create the
world's largest oil company, but said no deal has been reached yet.
Reports surfaced this week that Exxon was negotiating to buy Mobil,
which has a current market value of about dlrs 61 billion. A
combination of the two _ the nation's largest oil and gas companies
_would leapfrog Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. as the world's
biggest energy company and would also surpass General Motors Corp.
as the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. In a short joint
statement, Mobil and Exxon said they could not guarantee a deal
would be reached. They declined further comment. (US-EXXON-MOBIL)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany prefers a three-way merger of the
European aerospace industry, including France and Britain, and will
advise French officials during a summit next week, a source said
Friday. However, the source said, if Britain and Germany come to an
agreement before France is ready, Germany would insist that the
``door be held open'' for French participation later. The big
European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace, British
Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March to seek a
merger to compete with the Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Daimler-Benz
Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advance talks on a two-way
alliance. (GERMANY-AEROSPACE MERGER)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Alusuisse-Lonza Group Ltd (Algroup),
Switzerland's biggest aluminum group, and Germany's Viag industrial
concern announced Friday they would merge. The deal, rumored for a
week, will create a group with an estimated 53 billion German marks
(dlrs 31 billion) in annual sales and 40 billion marks (dlrs 23.5
billion) in market value. The new holding company will be based in
Viag's headquarters in the southern German city of Munich. Some
2,500 jobs _ two percent of the 127,000 workforce _ will be lost
over three years, mainly through early retirement.
(SWITZERLAND-GERMANY-METAL MERGER)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The heads of eight of Europe's most powerful stock
exchanges expressed support Friday for the creation of a
pan-European market, the company that runs France's stock market
said. The Societe des Bourses Francaises, the SBF, which was
hosting a meeting of European stock exchange leaders in Paris, also
said that a stock alliance committee had been formed to advance the
process of creating a single European stock market. The Paris
meeting came four months after the Frankfurt and London exchanges
had announced plans for the creation of an Anglo-German market.
(FRANCE-EURO STOCK MARKET)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In his most candid remarks yet on the
economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday
that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the
EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1. Despite an area-wide
survey that suggested ``a moderation in the pace of growth,''
Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to boost the economy.
He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market conditions
as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate cuts toward the 3.3
percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries. Duisenberg,
who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 22
meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the
outlook for inflation and the EU economy. (GERMANY-CENTRAL BANK)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Italy's national carrier Alitalia SpA signed an agreement Friday
launching a long-term alliance including cargo and passenger joint
ventures. The alliance, in which KLM and Alitalia are equal
partners, aims to strengthen both airlines' position in
intercontinental and European passenger and cargo routes. At the
alliance's official launch, KLM and Alitalia said they don't intend
to take equity positions in each other's company. The joint
ventures will be based on ``sharing of the greater part of the
revenues and costs of the carriers' route networks,'' the airlines
said in a statement. (NETHERLANDS-KLM-ALITALIA)

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton on Friday answered the
81 questions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee, asserting
he told the truth about Monica Lewinsky to a grand jury and in a
sworn deposition. ``That testimony was not false and misleading,''
he said. The furor over his alleged attempts to conceal his
relationship with the former White House intern ``long ago ceased
to be primarily a legal or political issue,'' the president said,
calling it instead a painful personal saga. Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde has indicated he wants the committee to finish its work
on impeachment the week of Dec. 7 and the full House could then
meet the following week to vote, if necessary, on Clinton's fate.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq reacted positively to several
requests by the U.N. weapons inspector to resolve outstanding
issues but rejected other U.N. demands and alleged that deadly VX
nerve agent was planted on an Iraqi warhead to discredit Baghdad.
The Iraqis didn't identify who may have been responsible for
planting the nerve agent on the warhead fragment, taken from Iraq
last May. But they intimated that it was either the United States
or the weapons inspectors themselves. The responses reflected
Baghdad's determination to comply with inspectors' requests that it
deems legitimate in its quest for a declaration of Iraqi
disarmament, the key condition for lifting a debilitating economic
embargo. But they also reflected continued defiance on issues
Baghdad feels it has already answered or are outside the mandate of
U.N. inspectors. (UN-IRAQ)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Authorities tightened security around the
country Friday for fear of attacks timed to the 20th anniversary of
a Kurdish rebel organization, despite the rebel leader's
declaration that the group had given up armed struggle.
Investigators examined the wreckage left by a bomb that blew up a
bus on a road about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Ankara,
killing four and injuring 17 early Friday. Suspicion fell on the
Kurdistan Workers Party, blamed for similar bombings in its war for
Kurdish autonomy. If the PKK were shown responsible, the attack
stands to discredit Abdullah Ocalan's claim this month that the
rebels would now use only peaceful means to advance the Kurdish
cause. Ocalan announced a PKK change of policy shortly after his
Nov. 12 arrest in Rome, where he is now awaiting a decision on his
request for political asylum. (TURKEY-KURDS)
	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Rescuers using cranes and acetylene torches
to cut through the wreckage of two trains Friday have extricated
205 bodies after one of India's worst railway crashes in recent
times. Police and railway officials in the wheat-trading town of
Khanna, in the northwestern state of Punjab, said the death toll
would probably rise after the last of the wreckage is cleared
Saturday. Ten more passengers were feared buried in the mangled
debris, said S.P. Mehta, a general manager of Indian Railways. The
Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi and
toppled into the path of the oncoming train on a parallel track in
pre-dawn mist Thursday. (INDIA-TRAIN ACCIDENT)
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday called
on African leaders - especially those at war in Congo - to renounce
violence and accept compromise in the quest for peace on the
strife-torn continent. Speaking at a summit of African leaders in
Paris, Annan said many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture
of intolerance'' and that war in Congo poses the greatest challenge
for the continent. French President Jacques Chirac urged African
nations to do their own peacekeeping _ a departure from past
practices that put the burden on France and other Western nations.
Chirac also renewed France's call for a regional peace conference
in central Africa's Great Lakes region. (FRANCE-AFRICA SUMMIT)

	   ST. ALBANS, England (AP) _ Miss Melanie doesn't need to
matriculate to get a degree.
	   Olivia de Havilland, 82, accepted an honorary doctorate Friday
from the University of Hertfordshire at graduation ceremonies in
the Abbey and Cathedral Church of St. Albans on Friday.
	   ``You can't imagine how much it means to me to be here in this
historic cathedral and to be receiving from the University of
Hertfordshire the honorary degree of doctor of letters,'' she told
300 graduates who crowded into the church with family and friends.
``For both the cathedral and the university are of special
significance to my English family, and my English family is of
special significance to me.''
	   Her cousin, Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, founded the de Havilland
aviation company, a predecessor of British Aerospace, and the
university campus in nearby Hatfield was built on land formerly
owned by the company.
	   Even though she won her Academy Awards for ``To Each His Own''
(1946) and ``The Heiress'' (1949) and starred in such other notable
films as ``The Snake Pit,'' she will be forever remembered as
Melanie in ``Gone With The Wind.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rapper and music producer Sean ``Puff Daddy''
Combs took time out from serving up hip-hop hits to treat more than
2,000 homeless people to Thanksgiving dinner in Harlem.
	   Combs returned to the gymnasium where he once played basketball
as a child to dish out the turkey and side dishes that are
traditional for the American holiday, and said Thanksgiving is a
time to remember those less fortunate.
	   ``Being homeless is the worst thing in the world on a day like
today,'' he said. ``Hopefully, they won't be as lonely. They've got
a family, and I am part of their family.''
	   Fellow rapper Sister Souljah helped organize the dinner.
	   ``We're happy that we get a good crowd,'' she said. ``But we're
concerned about the state of affairs in the city.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Strawberry Fields may be forever, but a vigil to
John Lennon's memory has a curfew.
	   The city Parks Department says it has refused a request by his
fans to extend a 1 a.m. Central Park curfew next month on the 18th
anniversary of Lennon's murder.
	   ``We don't allow any events to go past one,'' said Parks
Department spokesman Ed Skyler. ``If you make an exception there,
you have to make an exception for everybody.''
	   Fans gather annually on Dec. 8 for a vigil in a section of the
park called Strawberry Fields to remember the 1980 slaying of
Lennon by a deranged fan outside the nearby Dakota apartment
building.
	   Fans gather shortly before 10:50 p.m. (0350 GMT of Dec. 9) _ the
time Lennon was shot _ and light candles, place photographs and
sing and listen to the ex-Beatle's songs.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ian McKellen can offer a ready rebuttal to the
recurring obituaries written about the theater.
	   ``Theater will never die, because what is special about theater
as a form of storytelling is that it's on a human scale,'' says the
59-year-old actor best know for his classical stage performances.
``It's not huge images on a massive screen, and images of people
who are dead, or who certainly are not in the room with you. Actors
on a stage ARE THERE. You're in the same space. That's why I don't
like when the spaces get too big and the voices are coming through
microphones.''
	   McKellen, who's appearing onscreen these days in ``Gods and
Monsters'' and ``Apt Pupil,'' told The Associated Press that people
will always want a more personal, intimate form of entertainment.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The widow of former pop singer and U.S.
lawmaker Sonny Bono says she's learning the hard way that she can
sometimes be ``too honest.''
	   U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, who was elected to fill her husband's House
seat last April, reiterated in an interview Friday with The
Associated Press that her husband had a prescription drug problem,
but she said she wished she never had raised the issue.
	   ``A reporter asked me a direct question and I answered it,''
Mrs. Bono said. ``In hindsight, I wish I hadn't said anything.''
	   The reporter worked for TV Guide. Its Nov. 28 issue quotes Mrs.
Bono saying painkillers contributed to her husband's death last
January, when he skied into a tree. ``What he did showed absolute
lack of judgment,'' she told the magazine.
	   Since those statements were publicized, her telephone never
stops ringing, she said during a phone interview from her parents'
home in North Carolina.

Austrians dominate opening women's World Cup downhill

<TEXT>
	   LAKE LOUISE, Alberta (AP) _ Austrian Renate Goetschl took the
first women's World Cup downhill race of the season while her
country dominated the event in this Rocky Mountain resort.
	   Goetschl, 23, blazed down the soft course, which has been
covered in new snow the past two days, in a time of one minute
36.12 seconds.
	   She said the course befuddled skiers with its flat spots. ``But
you still can't make mistakes,'' she added.
	   Goetschl led a trio of Austrians in the top six, including a
third-place finish by Alexandra Meissnitzer.
	   Meissnitzer's time of 1:36.64 was well behind second-place
finisher Isolde Kostner of Italy, who handled the course _ 2.7
kilometers (1.68 miles) with a vertical drop of 735 meters (2,411
feet) _ in 1:36.43.
	   Meissnitzer said the Austrian women have been overshadowed by
the success of their male compatriots and the German women.
	   But with German dynamo Katja Seizinger sidelined for the season
after injuring a knee, Meissnitzer said it was time to make a
statement.
	   ``The Austrian team this year is in really good shape and it
doesn't depend on Seizinger if she's here or not,'' said
Meissnitzer. ``It would have been hard to beat Renate today.
	   ``We're always in the shadow of the men. This means a lot to the
team, it's important that we're starting with a big success.''

Chilean, British ministers meet as court extends Pinochet deadline

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Citing the ``historic'' nature of the case, a
judge gave Britain's government an extra week to decide whether to
allow the extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet to face charges
including genocide.
	   Chile's foreign minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, flew into London
to meet with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, arguing that
Pinochet should be allowed to return home.
	   The former Chilean dictator will learn his fate when British
Home Secretary Jack Straw announces his decision at a Dec. 11 court
appearance.
	   Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Graham Parkinson
ordered Pinochet to appear in court to hear Straw's decision,
``subject to any medical reports.''
	   Pinochet, 83, who is sought by Spanish authorities on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his 17-year rule,
remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he is
recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British police on
Oct. 16.
	   ``There must be time given for proper consideration,'' Parkinson
told attorneys representing Britain, Spain and Pinochet on Friday.
``It is in some respects quite a historic decision to make.''
	   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled Wednesday that Pinochet
could not claim immunity as a former head of state.
	   Cook issued a statement after his meeting with Insulza saying
that his Chilean counterpart had expressed his government's
``strong view'' that Pinochet should be returned home.
	   Cook said he assured Insulza _ who himself lived in exile under
Pinochet's regime _ that neither the dictator's original arrest nor
subsequent actions by the British government had been ``politically
motivated.''
	   ``We both expressed our shared commitment to maintaining good
relations between our two countries,'' Cook said.
	   The Chilean Embassy filed written arguments on Thursday with
British authorities, and Insulza made no comment after the meeting.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Straw would make the
decision independently.
	   ``He will not be seeking the views of Cabinet colleagues,'' said
a spokesman for Blair, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
prime minister does not expect to be consulted on this at all.''
	   Pinochet is receiving psychiatric care for stress-related
disorders, which his lawyers might cite in a bid to have him found
mentally unfit to stand trial, The Times reported Friday.
	   ``He is undergoing assessment for stress and stress-related
disorders,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified ``highly placed
medical source'' as saying.
	   Straw, whose department is responsible for justice issues, has
wide discretion to decide whether to follow the House of Lords
ruling and send the Spanish extradition request through the courts
_ or to allow Pinochet to go free.
	   Pinochet's supporters, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, are pressing Straw to allow the general to return home on
``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail health and age.
	   Human rights activists are urging the government to let the case
make its way through the British courts. A Chilean government
report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands
of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship, which began in
1973 when he overthrew President Salvador Allende. Allende died in
the coup.

Pressure in Israel grows for pullout from south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ There have been seven military funerals over
the past 10 days. Again and again, Israel's nightly news has led
with anguished parents sobbing as the caskets of their sons,
soldiers in their teens or early 20s, were lowered into the ground.
	   Sensing the growing popular pressure to get the troops out of
Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday promised a
thorough review of Israel's policy, saying he cut short a trip to
Europe and returned home to ``make decisions.''
	   He called a Sunday meeting of Cabinet ministers and generals to
discuss Lebanon, one of many attempts, all unsuccessful, in recent
months to ``rethink'' the policy.
	   Israel invaded Lebanon twice, in 1978 and 1982, to drive back
guerrillas with the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah. Israel set up a
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon after
withdrawing from the rest of Lebanon in 1985.
	   The Israeli rationale for maintaining the security zone is to
prevent Hezbollah from approaching Israeli villages along the
border. Israel's history is spotted with bloody terror attacks in
cities and towns near the border, including assaults on a school
and a kindergarten.
	   Netanyahu said Friday he would only pull Israeli troops out of
southern Lebanon if this did not expose northern Israel to
Hezbollah attacks.
	   With Hezbollah unwilling to give such guarantees, it is unlikely
Israeli troops will redeploy any time soon.
	   Hezbollah commander Sheik Nabil Kaouk on Friday offered little
encouragement that an Israeli troop withdrawal would quickly end
the conflict. He warned that ``any adventure by the Israeli
occupiers to try and change the status quo in south Lebanon will
serve to increase its losses.''
	   Since 1985, Israel's policy has been based on the belief that it
can only pull out its troops as part of a peace agreement with
Lebanon. However, Syria, the main power in Lebanon, is unlikely to
permit such talks until Israel withdraws from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 war.
	   Netanyahu is unwilling to hand back the Golan, thus making a
peace agreement with Syria or Lebanon in the near-future unlikely.
	   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot quoted Netanyahu as saying in
London that he did not reject out of hand a plan by Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon under which Israel would withdraw gradually
and strike Hezbollah if it attacked northern Israel.
	   However, upon his return home Netanyahu appeared to be sticking
closer to Israel's long-standing policy. ``As long as we don't have
an alternative, we'll stay in Lebanon in order to defend northern
Israel,'' he said.
	   Still, the rising death toll is increasing Israeli popular
pressure to end Israel's occupation of south Lebanon. In all, 23
Israelis have died in Lebanon this year.
	   A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated that
40 percent of Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal, compared to
only 16 percent in February 1997. The survey was conducted among
560 adults and had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.
	   A signed front-page commentary in Yediot Ahronot called on
Netanyahu to ``take an initiative,'' cut through the tangle of
Israel's involvement in Lebanon and order a pullout.
	   Many Israelis say that if the Israeli army is no longer in
Lebanon, Hezbollah will have no reason to attack. The Lebanese
government endorses that argument.
	   But Hezbollah, sponsored by Iran and driven by an extremist
ideology that leaves no room for a Jewish state in the Middle East,
has given no such assurances.
	   A unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon would be a
``gamble,'' Israeli army Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz has said.
	   The grim choice facing Israel's leaders may well be choosing
between army casualties and civilian casualties, say opponents of
an Israeli pullout. They say Syria would have an interest in
wearing Israel down by encouraging Hezbollah attacks against
Israeli villages.
	   Along the Israeli border, many residents are nervous about the
prospect of an Israeli army pullout. A mayor of one of the border
towns estimated that if a terror attack follows an Israeli military
withdrawal, 20 percent of the residents of the area would leave for
good.

Radio broadcasts aim to give Iraqis a news alternative
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ When it comes to learning about the rest of
the world, Iraqis have had few choices beyond tightly controlled
government outlets.
	   President Bill Clinton's administration is trying to add at
least a U.S. point of view to the alternatives with a new program,
Radio Free Iraq, part of an expanding effort to weaken President
Saddam Hussein's grip on his people.
	   For the past four weeks, Iraqis have been able to hear
Arabic-language news and commentary on a 45-minute daily broadcast
from studios in Prague, Czech Republic. They are patterned along
the lines of the U.S.-sponsored broadcasts to communist countries
during the Cold War.
	   ``We are using truth and accuracy to fight propaganda,'' says
David Newton, director of the Prague-based station. ``The goal is
to promote democracy, to let the Iraqi people hear different
opinions.''
	   The broadcasts and a similar program beamed into Iran have
caused some security concerns in Prague. The new Czech government
agreed to allow the broadcasts but asked broadcasters to look into
moving out of a densely populated residential area.
	   The broadcasts into Iran drew immediate criticism from Seyyed
Jafar Hashemi, Iran's ambassador in the Czech Republic, who called
them ``an act of aggression against the government and people of
Iran by the United States.''
	   Iraqi authorities are not known to have commented on Radio Free
Iraq.
	   Newton says Radio Free Iraq is getting no real feedback from its
listeners and does not expect quick results. ``This is a long-term
proposition,'' he says.
	   Radio Free Iraq is not the only international service available
to Iraqis. They also can tune in Arabic services of the British
Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America as well as the
French-sponsored Radio Monte Carlo. But officials point out that
Radio Free Iraq is tailored exclusively for Iraqi audiences while
the other services are beamed throughout the Arab world.
	   The new radio station's mandate is to provide news and
commentary that is ``not inconsistent'' with U.S. government
policy, says Paul Gobel, a high official of Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, the entity that beamed broadcasts into communist countries
during the Cold War and has continued operations in the
post-communist era.
	   Working with a dlrs 5 million budget, Radio Free Iraq is off to
a modest start. It offers a rerun of the 45-minute program later in
the day and plans to expand the broadcast to three hours next year.
	   Gobel says it is impossible to measure listenership in Iraq.
	   ``We will know that we matter if we are attacked,'' he says.
	   One anti-Saddam stratagem the administration will avoid is using
Radio Free Iraq to call on the Iraqi masses to rise up against
their leader.
	   Gobel says that approach has been ruled out since the United
States got into international broadcasting early on in the Cold
War.
	   The broadcasts, he adds, ``may seem bland to someone accustomed
to a free press but to an Iraqi who is constantly fed propaganda,
it's revolutionary.''
	   Radio Free Iraq has been incorporated under the RFE/RL umbrella,
bringing to 21 the number of services it operates. A network of
stringers has been assembled in a number of countries to contribute
to the newscasts.
	   From within Iraq, the station expects to use electronic-mail and
other means to cover developments in predominantly Kurdish northern
Iraq, a hotbed of anti-Saddam sentiment. The Shiite population of
southern Iraq is equally hostile to Saddam, but coverage
opportunities for Radio Free Iraq there are less promising.
	   The station is one of several manifestations of an
administration attempt to increase pressure on Iraq beyond military
threats and U.N. sanctions which, after eight years, appear to have
done little to destabilize the regime.
	   The administration also is prepared to provide support for
democratic Iraqi groups opposed to Saddam. Congress has authorized
dlrs 97 million in military assistance for such groups. The
administration also is gathering evidence for possible U.N.
prosecutions of Iraqis suspected of committing crimes against
humanity in Kuwait and elsewhere.

Philadelphia beats Toronto 4-3

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Eric Lindros and Keith Jones each had a goal
and two assists and John LeClair scored the game-winner during a
wild second period as Philadelphia snapped Toronto's three-game
winning streak, 4-3.
	   Rod Brind'Amour also scored Friday for the Flyers and LeClair
added a pair of assists for Philadelphia, which has won five of its
last six games.
	   Igor Korolev and Todd Warriner each had a goal and an assist,
and Dimitri Yushkevich also scored for the Maple Leafs, who missed
a chance for their longest winning streak in four years.
 &UR; Bruins 5, Canadiens 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, the Bruins scored five goals in the final period, two
by Sergei Samsonov in a span of about six minutes to beat
struggling Montreal 5-1.
	   Ray Bourque, Don Sweeney and Jason Allison also had third-period
goals for the Bruins, who jammed their scoring into the opening
12:19 of the final period en route to their fourth consecutive win.
	   Saku Koivu had a second-period goal for Montreal, losers of six
of its last seven games.
	   Byron Dafoe, coming off his fourth shutout of the season in a
1-0 win at Florida on Wednesday night, had 24 saves for Boston.
 &UR; Sharks 4, Blues 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Jeff Norton scored a power-play goal with 8:56
remaining as San Jose won its first road game 4-2.
	   The Sharks, 1-5-3 on the road this year, appeared ready to go
down once again after Chris Pronger's goal at 4:47 of the third
period gave the Blues a 2-1 lead. But Steve Guolla tied the game 17
seconds later, and Norton scored his first goal on a slap shot from
the left circle while Pronger was in the box for interference.
	   Marco Sturm added an unassisted empty net goal at 18:47 to ice
the game.

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ Rescuers have pulled 205 bodies from the
wreckage of two trains in India, using cranes and blow torches to
cut through the mangled debris and prying corpses that were trapped
after India's deadliest rail disaster in three years.
	   Nearly 1,500 grieving relatives converged on the wheat-trading
town of Khanna on Friday to find survivors or identify the dead.
	   Of the 205 bodies recovered, only slightly more than half have
been identified. Most of the rest were so badly mutilated they
remained unclaimed, S.P. Mehta of Indian Railways said.
	   No survivors have been found since Thursday, when the trains
collided in the northwestern state of Punjab. Ten more passengers
are feared dead in the debris, Mehta said. The last of the wreckage
was to be cleared Saturday.
	   Officials said 260 people were injured and about 30 were in
critical condition.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express collided with cars that had
uncoupled from the Frontier Mail en route from New Delhi and
toppled into the path of the oncoming train on a parallel track
Thursday.
	   Relatives sobbed uncontrollably as they peeked under one shroud
after another at the local college playground, converted into a
makeshift mortuary. Bodies were laid out on slabs of ice to slow
deterioration.
	   Unclaimed corpses were expected to be cremated by the
authorities Saturday.
	   Helped by giant cranes, nearly 2,500 workers untangled train
carriages to extricate bodies. Rescuers covered their faces because
of the stench of rotting flesh.
	   ``Many of the bodies are badly mutilated. We may never be able
to identify them,'' said A. K. Kapoor, a top official of the
government-owned railroad company who was supervising the rescue
operations.
	   Work speeded up after the arrival of the huge crane that could
lift an entire train car. The workers, including nearly 200 army
soldiers, supported the wobbly wreckage with planks of wood and
steel beams. Others used acetylene torches or crowbars.
	   The workers cleared and opened one of the two railroad tracks
after a 46-hour disruption, said Mehta, speaking at this town 150
miles (240 kilometers) northwest of New Delhi.
	   India records around 300 accidents a year on its railways, the
largest rail network under one management in the world. Most are
blamed on human error or outdated equipment.
	   Safety recommendations are often ignored in the rush to expand
the network. The government-owned railroad company added 500 trains
in the last four years.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day.
	   The Indian Express newspaper said a flashing light on the engine
and last coach of the train _ a recommendation of numerous safety
committees _ might have prevented the accident. The government has
said it has little money for better equipment.
	   The worst accident was three years ago when two trains collided
near New Delhi, killing 358 people.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ His main goal out of the way, Pete
Sampras can now concentrate on another record at the ATP Tour World
Championship.
	   After making sure of finishing as No. 1 for the sixth
consecutive year, Sampras can pull even with Ivan Lendl in winning
the season-ending tournament for the fifth time.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Sampras played Alex Corretja, while
Tim Henman battled Carlos Moya, the French Open champion.
	   Sampras is the defending champion, having won the dlrs 3.5
million tournament the past two years.
	   Having not conceded a set in three matches, Sampras looked
impressive.
	   ``He's playing amazingly, he's just unbeatable,'' said Moya, who
was one Sampras' victims in the round-robin portion.
	   Sampras was assured of holding the No. 1 spot for the sixth
consecutive year when Marcelo Rios had to drop out with a back
injury Thursday. That ruined Rios' hopes of challenging Sampras for
the No. 1.
	   Moya, who had not won an indoor match until earlier this week,
made the semifinals by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5, 7-5.
Kafelnikov had beaten Moya is last year's semifinals, before losing
to Sampras in the final.
	   ``I was stronger mentally this year,'' Moya said. ``He was
coming back every time from a break down but I was strong enough
mentally to win.''
	   Although not known for prowess indoors, Moya has now reached the
semis twice in a row.
	   ``If I'm in the semifinals, I deserve to be there and I am very
proud,'' said Moya, who is ranked No. 4 in the world.
	   ``I fought until the death. I had to be like a wall, putting
back every ball,'' he said.
	   Henman, already assured of a place in the semifinals, lost to
British teammate Greg Rusedski, 6-2, 6-4.
	   The victory gave Rusedski, an alternate for injured Andre
Agassi, short-lived hopes of making he semifinals.
	   But when Corretja downed fellow Spaniard and friend Albert Costa
6-2, 6-4, Corretja was in and Rusedski was out. Costa had replaced
Rios.
	   ``It was a disappointing performance,'' said Henman, who is the
first Briton to make the semis in the event. ``But I'm obviously
through to the semifinals so I need to pick up my performance.''
	   ``Moya is playing really well at the moment and it's not going
to be easy,'' Henman said.

Schroeder says Germany has no intention of extraditing Ocalan

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany and Italy hope to extricate Europe from
growing Kurdish-Turkish tension by arranging for the trial of a
Kurdish rebel leader in an international court. Kurds continued to
press for the release of Abdullah Ocalan, who now seeks a political
solution with Turkey.
	   Fearing unrest among Germany's many Turkish Kurds, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder on Friday ruled out seeking Ocalan's extradition
on murder and terror charges.
	   The announcement followed Schroeder's meeting with Italian
Premier Massimo D'Alema, whose country arrested Ocalan two weeks
ago on a German warrant.
	   Schroeder noted that Germany has more Turkish Kurds than any
other European Union nation _ about a quarter of its 2 million
Turkish nationals are Kurdish _ and said he was acting to ``protect
the peace'' by not bringing Ocalan here for trial.
	   D'Alema, who also agreed to push for an international court,
said he took Schroeder's concerns seriously and that he could not
judge questions of German internal security.
	   Even as the politicians met in Bonn, 11,000 Turkish Kurds
rallied nearby to support the rebel leader. Some beat drums and
carried photographs of Ocalan, whose outlawed Kurdish Workers
Party, or PKK, has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Kurdish groups have announced protests for Saturday in several
cities around Germany.
	   After the meeting, Schroeder said Germany and Italy will work
with Turkey to help it resolve the question of Kurdish autonomy at
home. ``We want a friendly, normal relations with Turkey,'' the
chancellor said.
	   Ocalan _ a fugitive from terror and murder charges in Turkey,
where he faces the death penalty _ was arrested Nov. 12 when he
arrived at the Rome airport aboard a flight from Moscow.
	   A Rome court freed him last Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant
because Italian law forbids the extradition of suspects to
countries where they face the death penalty. The decision enraged
many in Turkey who consider Ocalan their most-wanted criminal.
Protesters have burned Italian clothes and cars and launched
boycotts against Italian products.
	   Turkish authorities tightened security around the country Friday
for fear of attacks timed to the 20th anniversary of a Kurdish
rebel organization, despite the rebel leader's declaration that the
group had given up armed struggle.
	   Investigators examined the wreckage left by a bomb that blew up
a bus on a road about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Ankara,
killing four and injuring 17 early Friday. Suspicion fell on the
PKK, blamed for similar bombings in its war for Kurdish autonomy.
	   PKK responsibility would discredit Ocalan's announcement this
month that the rebels would now use only peaceful means to advance
the cause of Turkey's Kurds.
	   The international attention to Ocalan's case could push Turkey
to review its Kurdish policy, which does not grant minority rights
to some 12 million Kurds.
	   For now, Ocalan is under police surveillance at a Rome villa.
Judges have ordered him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give
Germany time to mull over extradition. Germany, as well as the
other countries in the European Union, does not have the death
penalty.
	   Germany has two arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one
for a single murder charged in 1990 and another issued last
weekend. German media reports say the new, broader charges include
``liquidation of a string of dissidents'' in Germany in the 1980s
and a string of arson attacks in 1993. The attacks led Germany to
ban the PKK as a terrorist group the same year.
	   The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany, Mehmet
Tanriverdi, has asked the German government to help reach a
political settlement in Turkey on the question of Kurdish autonomy.
He also says Ocalan should be given asylum in Italy and be free to
travel in Europe.

Soccer, tennis and cycling face pressure to comply with doping
</HEADLINE>
policies &QL;

 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Five years ago, Olympic sports
agreed to unify their anti-doping policies. It didn't work.
	   Will it this time?
	   International federations approved a series of measures Friday
to harmonize the fight against banned drugs _ including a mininum
two-year suspension for a first major offense and life for a
second.
	   But cracks were apparent as three major federations _
representing soccer, tennis and cycling _ expressed reservations
and refused to go along with the other 32 sports bodies.
	   Now, the three dissenting sports face the possibility of being
thrown out of the Olympics unless they fall into line.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was confident the
dissenting federations would sign up to the agreement before the
world anti-doping summit in Lausanne in February.
	   ``These three federations have reservations, but after
consulting with their governing bodies, I'm sure they will agree,''
he said.
	   Track and field chief Primo Nebiolo, head of the association of
all summer federations, pushed through a last-minute resolution
stating that compliance with Friday's agreement was a condition for
being an Olympic sport.
	   The message: accept the terms or you're out of the Olympics.
	   ``That was as strong a message as they could have received,''
said John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee and
a leading advocate for hardline doping policy. ``The ultimate
sanction is participation in the Olympic Games.''
	   Soccer, cycling and tennis _ worried that they might not meet
all the other terms _ all expressed objections to that provision.
	   Despite the clear warning in the document, Samaranch carefully
avoided making any ultimatums, preferring to let the federations
police themselves.
	   ``I think all federations will remain on the Olympic program,''
he said. ``The policy of the IOC is not to threaten the
federations.''
	   It's the same situation that existed five years ago when the IOC
brokered an accord on harmonization of anti-doping rules _ only for
the deal to unravel after soccer, tennis and cycling failed to
comply fully.
	   Friday's agreement binds the 28 summer sports and seven winter
sports to abide by a unified medical code that includes a minimum
two-year suspension for athletes using steroids or other major
doping substances.
	   Athletes caught a second time would be banned for life.
	   Previous IOC guidelines recommended a two-year ban as a maximum
punishment.
	   Friday's agreement allows federations to impose additional
sanctions, including fines or other financial penalties.
	   FIFA's acting general secretary, Michael Zen-Ruffinen, objected
to the two-year sanction on grounds that the penalty might not
stand up in court and because certain prohibited drugs have no
performance-enhancing benefits in sports like soccer.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter did not attend Friday's meeting. He
was in South Africa to receive an award from Nelson Mandela.
	   Samaranch said he planned to meet with Blatter on Jan. 6 to try
to find an accord.
	   The cycling federation, whose sport was damaged by revelations
of systematic doping during the Tour de France, went along with the
two-year sanction.
	   But UCI president Hein Verbruggen said the penalty won't serve
much use because it won't be accepted by the legal system.
	   ``The rules have to be in line with what is acceptable to the
courts,'' he said.
	   On another key issue, the federations expressed support for the
establishment of an independent agency to coordinate anti-doping
efforts around the world.
	   They also supported the collaboration of governments in the
anti-doping fight, pledged to increase their anti-drug prevention
campaigns and agreed that the Court of Arbitration for Sport should
be the final avenue of appeal in doping disputes.

Kabila appears closer to dialogue with Uganda, Rwanda

	   PARIS (AP) _ Congolese leader Laurent Kabila appeared to be
edging closer to a dialogue with his adversaries on Saturday, a day
after the first sub-Saharan African U.N. Secretary rebuked his
continent's leaders for cultivating a ``culture of intolerance.''
	   Kabila, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu,
Rwanda's leader, are attending a summit of African leaders in
Paris. Both Rwanda and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency
in the Congo.
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled to hold separate
talks with French President Jacques Chirac on Saturday.
	   Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said there had been
some progress toward a dialogue between Kabila and his adversaries,
with each of the parties presenting their views.
	   ``That at least allows one to look directly at the problems,
which is a beginning,'' Colonna said.
	   Secretary General Kofi Annan on Friday called on African leaders
- especially those at war in Congo - to renounce violence and
accept compromise in the quest for peace on the strife-torn
continent.
	   Speaking at a summit of African leaders in Paris, Annan said
many African conflicts are ``rooted in a culture of intolerance''
and that war in Congo poses the greatest challenge for the
continent.
	   ``In the Congo, as everywhere, what is needed is for all parties
irrevocably to choose peace and compromise, turning their backs on
violence and conflict,'' Annan said.
	   Though concrete solutions to the Congo crisis were unlikely to
emerge from the summit, participants said they hoped for progress.
	   Charles Josselin, France's cooperation minister in Africa, said
Friday he hoped for a resolution to the conflict in Congo ``during
the month of December.''
	   And the Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared to meet
with Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila has not been optimistic, saying a pullout of Rwandan
and Ugandan-backed forces from the Congo was a precondition for
substantive talks on a peace settlement.
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France
Internationale, Kabila added that his allies, Angola and Zimbabwe,
``were not pushing (him) to negotiate.''
	   In Chirac's address to the 20th French-African summit, where 34
African leaders are focusing on security issues, he renewed
France's call for a regional peace conference in central Africa's
Great Lakes region.
	   He urged African nations to do their own peacekeeping - a
departure from past practices that put the burden on France and
other Western nations.
	   Chirac called on African nations to move forward with plans for
regional security structures, but added this would not imply an
``erosion of responsibilities'' by the United Nations or the
international community.
	   ``The reality at the end of 1998 is that a quarter of
sub-Saharan African states are in crisis,'' he said, ``in most
cases, spilling over national borders.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A 25-year-old Colombian suspected in
last weekend's slaying of a U.S. drug agent has surrendered to
authoritiesat a ranch owned by his family southwest of Bogota,
authorities said.
	   Jorge Figueroa Monroy was paraded before the news media in the
capital by national police director Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, who
said the suspect had turned himself in at a ranch in Ilarco, Tolima
state, in the presence of an attorney.
	   The short-haired Figueroa, dressed in a smart suit and wearing a
blue tie, did not speak to reporters.
	   Figueroa was described by witnesses as the man who shot and
killed Frank Arnold Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, outside a Bogota
discotheque early Sunday after an argument with the Drug
Enforcement Administration agent, police say. After the shooting,
Figueroa fled on a motorcycle, they said.
	   The suspect, who is from a well-to-do Bogota family and was not
currently employed, had been trying to negotiate his surrender in
return for a reduced sentence, said police sources who spoke on
condition they not be further identified. Murder carries a maximum
sentence of 30 years in prison in Colombia.
	   The deputy federal prosecutor, Jaime Cordoba Trivino, did not
comment on a possible plea bargain. Officials said before the
surrender that such a deal was unlikely.
	   Cordoba said Colombia has not received an extradition request
from the United States for Figueroa.
	   An autopsy of the 37-year-old DEA agent found a small amount of
alcohol and no drugs in his body, police sources said. They said
Moreno had gone to the El Divino discotheque with a Colombian
friend after a day of motorcycle riding.
	   Figueroa was described by police as a well-known fixture of the
Zona Rosa entertainment district, where Moreno was killed.
Authorities said they did not know exactly what words were
exchanged between the two men before the shooting or whether
Figueroa knew the victim was a DEA agent.
	   U.S. officials have said that Moreno's death was unrelated to
his job, although Colombian police said members of Figueroa's
family were being investigated for alleged money laundering.
	   A 20-year-old Colombian wounded in the neck during Sunday's
shooting died the following day. Police said it appeared that
Figueroa only fired one shot, and the bullet probably ricocheted.

	   THREE HUNDRED PEAKS MOUNTAIN, Thailand (AP) _ Monsoon clouds
scrape jagged limestone cliffs that plunge into the dawning sea.
Fishing smacks, their nets piled high, cast off from a remote
beach.
	   The sweet scent of burning coconut husks drifts across a green
lacework of canals. Bird songs mingle with the chant of Buddhist
monks in village temples.
	   Off the beaten tourist tracks, these are two of Thailand's
alluring regions as recently experienced by a group of Thais and
foreigners from the seats of their leisurely whirring mountain
bikes.
	   And as the country gears up for what promises to be the biggest
tourist season ever, more people are planning to capture its
sights, sounds and smells via the bicycle.
	   Recreational biking is relatively new in Thailand. Many look
down on bicycles as old-fashioned and needlessly fatiguing,
symbolic of those without the means to upgrade to motorbikes or
pickup trucks.
	   ``The bike has been regarded as a poor man's vehicle,'' says
Thongchai Phansawat, president of the now 2,000-strong Thailand
Cycling Club, recalling he was once barred from a government
building when he showed up on a bicycle.
	   Thongchai, an environmental engineer, says genuine concerns
about the environment and fitness plus a penchant for copying
Western trends sparked interest in biking about five years ago.
	   Tour organizers saw profit from both locals and foreign visitors
seeking more elemental encounters with the country than travel by
bus, car and plane normally afford.
	   ``This is the old Thailand. Sometimes you forget there are still
such places left just off the main roads,'' said Tanit Habanananda,
a medical doctor, as our group pedaled into the great water world
of the Central Thailand plains some 100 kilometers (60 miles)
southwest of Bangkok.
	   Soon we were enveloped in plantations of coconut, mango and
lychee sustained by a vast network of canals which once provided
the only form of transport in the region and spawned one of the
world's great rice bowls.
	   When we took a break, friendly villagers emerged from their
wooden, stilt-propped houses amid the greenery to chat, happily
noting the rising price of coconuts.
	   The following day and further south along the Gulf of Siam
coast, we cycled 25 kilometers (15 miles) by long ranks of sea
pines and past fishing villages toward Khao Sam Roi Yot, or Three
Hundred Peaks Mountain.
	   This dramatic assembly of limestone summits is enclosed in a
national park well-known for its migratory shorebirds, the serow
goat-antelope, offshore dolphin and impressive caves.
	   Organizing our weekend bike trek was Tanin Rittavirun, a
32-year-old former businessman who first learned about mountain
biking in Japan and decided he would much rather make a living
through sport than the stock market.
	   He and his wife, Lek, started Bike and Travel 3 1/2 years ago,
and have gained a reputation for fine organization and friendly
ambiance.
	   Journeys by Tanin and others now range across Thailand, from
beaches and islands in the south to jungles near the border with
Myanmar, also known as Burma, to the infamous ``Death Railway''
built for the Japanese by Allied prisoners of war.
	   Some of the itineraries combine cycling with bird watching,
canoeing, rafting, visiting historic sites and even treks on
elephant back.
	   Another pioneering outfit, Diethelm Travel, features a sometimes
strenuous pedal to several hill tribe villages tucked into the
mountains of northern Thailand.
	   These cycling forays have proved particularly popular during
Thailand's cool season, between early November and mid-February,
when tourism peaks.
	   With prices very attractive due to the devaluation of the Thai
baht, and competing destinations like Malaysia and Indonesia in
political turmoil, Thailand expects a record tourism year. It
welcomed 7.2 million visitors in 1997.
	   While most will probably begin their vacations in the capital,
Bangkok, this is one place cyclists might want to avoid, given the
wild driving habits, notorious traffic jams and pollution.
	   ``One needs training and confidence,'' says Thongchai, trying to
sound reassuring. ``And if you go en masse it's not so scary.''

Japanese veteran denounces Tokyo's no-apology policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KANCHANABURI, Thailand (AP) _ A Japanese veteran on his 100th
trip of atonement to the site of World War II's Death Railway has
denounced Tokyo's refusal this week to fully make up to China and
surviving Allied prisoners for war-time atrocities.
	   Takashi Nagase, 80, of Kurashika City, Japan, offered two simple
words that have seemed to elude Japanese officialdom during Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit to Tokyo: ``I'm sorry.''
	   Nagase gave a similar apology to the elderly Allied veterans
whose demand for dlrs 450 million in compensation for brutality
suffered as prisoners of war was turned down by a Japanese court.
	   Nagase accused his government of ``playing a waiting game until
the last veteran dies. Then the issue is dead and buried.''
	   ``The Japanese did not give the POWs their own Red Cross parcels
during the war, so what makes them think they will get anything
now?'' Nagase said. ``I feel sorry for the ex-P0Ws.''
	   Nagase should know. He was an officer in the brutal Japanese
military police that oversaw the construction of the Death Railway
_ of which the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai in Kanchanaburi
was a part _ that linked up Japanese troops in Thailand and Burma.
	   At least 16,000 Allied prisoners and 100,000 Asian laborers died
building the railway, which cut through some of the most
inhospitable jungle on earth, from disease, starvation, torture and
execution.
	   Nagase has been one of the few Japanese veterans to publicly
campaign for Japan to apologize for war-time aggression. This week,
he made his 100th trip to the Kanchanaburi area since 1963 to
express his personal atonement.
	   Nagase has personally apologized to more than 100 former POWs
and offered money he raises back home to fund a variety of
charities here.
	   It's a contrast with official Japanese policy. On the 50th
anniversary of World War II's end, Tokyo expressed only ``deep
remorse,'' insufficient for many countries that suffered Japanese
depredations.
	   Nagase feels that Japan will never be able to hold its head up
in Asia until it comes clean about the war.
	   ``Tokyo should atone in a manner similar to West Germany after
World War II,'' Nagase said. ``Not even 100 pilgrimages can wash
away my sense of guilt.''
	   Nagase has apologized to many ex-POWs, including Eric Lomax, an
English prisoner whom Nagase questioned under torture. Lomax wrote
a best-selling memoir, ``The Railway Man.''
	   ``I have offered apologies to all those I meet, but some spat in
my face. Others threatened to throw me off the Bridge on the River
Kwai,'' Nagase said. ``Hate is a very powerful thing. Perhaps it
never dies.''
	   Nagase has earned the wrath of the Japanese Foreign Ministry
over his criticism of the late Emperor Hirohito and hard-core
Allied veterans who have branded him a publicity-seeking phony.
	   But the stooped old man has won the hearts and minds of local
Thais over the years with donations amounting to 50 million baht
(dlrs 1.5 million) raised from public donations in Japan.
	   Not only has he spent money on nursing scholarships for local
students and other charities, but in 1996 he discovered a former
slave laborer still living in Thailand and paid for his return to
Indonesia.
	   ``I give the money not from guilt, but from gratitude to the
Thai people,'' Nagase said. ``When Japan lost the war, the Thais
saved me from starvation.''
	   Thursday, at the opening of an annual light and sound festival
at the bridge, Nagase addressed an audience including the
ambassadors of the United States and Britain, two of Japan's
war-time enemies.
	   U.S. Ambassador William Itoh said his embassy was making efforts
to repair a memorial to U.S. war dead near the bridge that was
vandalized earlier this year.
	   Last year, local people constructed a grandstand for the light
show over the monument, removed only after complaints from the
embassy.

Mexican newspaper confirms former president's whereabouts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Where in the world is Carlos Salinas de
Gortari? After years of speculation, the disgraced former Mexican
president has set the record straight: Dublin, Ireland.
	   Salinas left Mexico soon after his 1988-94 term. His reputation
was stained by the economic turmoil which swept the country just
weeks after he left office and the arrest of his brother, Raul, in
1995 on charges of masterminding the assassination of a political
rival.
	   His presence in Ireland was widely known, but newspapers
recently had reported that Salinas had relocated to Cuba.
	   In an interview published Friday in the daily Reforma, Salinas
said he continues to live in Dublin, but spends much time in
London.
	   ``I also travel constantly to several Latin American and
Caribbean nations, and throughout Europe, in response to
invitations from think tanks, academic groups and non-government
organizations,'' he is quoted as saying.
	   The Reforma interview _ and several photos of Salinas' wife and
children _ appeared part of a plan to rehabilitate his image. He
previously has defended his administration in an interview with the
magazine Latin Finance, and in articles written for Newsweek
magazine and the Spanish newspaper El Pais.
	   A new biographical dictionary published by Oxford University
lists Salinas as one of only three Mexicans among the 20th
century's most important political figures. The other two were
revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata and former President Lazaro
Cardenas.

Mexican Congress erupts in budget battle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A scuffle that erupted in Mexico's Congress
has highlighted acrimony between legislators and the administration
over an unpopular 1999 budget proposal and a massive private bank
bailout.
	   Ruling party legislators shouted insults and scuffled with other
lawmakers and reporters Thursday after the opposition majority in
the House of Representatives shouted ``Resign! Resign!'' at Finance
Secretary Jose Angel Gurria and walked out of the session.
	   Sen. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, an independent lawmaker and former
congressman, said the disagreement could shut down the Mexican
government if it is not resolved.
	   ``It's very likely that the president's budget proposal won't be
approved by the Dec. 15 deadline,'' he said. Mexico's Congress is
normally in recess from mid-December to March.
	   After hours of gtilling, Gurria finally acknowledged that the
cost of a massive bailout of private banks had risen as high as
dlrs 67 billion.
	   Apparently angered by the repeated questioning and catcalls,
Gurria complained that lawmakers had turned the session into ``a
circus.''
	   That comment _ which the opposition called an attack on the
dignity of Congress _ sparked a walkout by the two largest
opposition parties. As legislators left Congress, they were pursued
by ruling-party lawmakers screeching insults.
	   One female opposition legislator was manhandled by another
female ruling-party representative; a reporter was grabbed by the
throat by another congressman from the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
	   After Gurria's disastrous confrontation with Congress,
opposition leaders said they are ceasing negotiations on the budget
unless Gurria resigns.

U.S. clergymen meets with pro-rebel villagers in Chiapas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POLHO, Mexico (AP) _ Twenty U.S. clergymen have delivered aid to
supporters of the leftist Zapatista rebels and met three villagers
who say they were attacked by Mexican soldiers this week.
	   Members of the Chicago-based charity Pastors for Peace on Friday
spoke with Indians who fled the nearby village of Acteal after 45
men, women and children were massacred there on Dec. 22, 1997.
	   Three refugees said they scuffled with soldiers Monday while
trying to work their crop fields near Acteal. Three who were
injured in the clash, Maria Arias, Veronica Perez and Juan Perez,
showed the pastors a bayonet they said was dropped by a Mexican
soldier.
	   State officials have disputed the villagers' version of events,
saying the skirmish began when about 100 people approached an army
camp and began shouting anti-government slogans.
	   The pastors spoke with a village doctor, Jose Luis Pineda
Salgado, who said that since last December, 34 refugees have died
due to ``infirmities of poverty.''
	   He said that half of the 10,500 refugees from across Chiapas
suffer malnutrition and illnesses such as diarrhea and lung
infections, especially among young children.
	   Thousands have been displaced by violence since the Zapatista
rebels rose up in January 1994 to demand greater democracy and
Indian rights.
	   Earlier this week, rebel negotiators ended their latest round of
peace talks with the government with no conclusive outcome.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Three people _ two landless rural
workers and a hired gunman _ were killed in two separate conflicts
Friday in a southern state, police said.
	   Landless rural worker Setimo Garibaldi, 51, was gunned down at
the Sao Francisco farm in the northeast of Parana state, 415 miles
(670 kms) south of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Ggunmen hired by the farm's owner tried to remove settlers who
had invaded and occupied the farm in September, said Parana state
policeman Adenaldo da Silva.
	   In a separate incident, landless rural worker Jose Rodrigues and
an unidentified hired gunman died in attempt to expel settlers from
the Pedra Branca farm in central Parana state, da Silva said.
	   In both cases, the settlers were members of the Landless Rural
Workers' Movement which has gained international attention by
occupying land it considers unproductive. Such land may be
expropriated and distributed to small farmers under Brazilian law.
	   The movement condemned the killings in a press release blaming
the ``state government's judicial policy'' for the deaths.
	   Land disputes are a frequent source of tension in this country
where the richest 20 percent of the population owns 88 percent of
the land, while the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent.
	   More a thousand people have lost their lives in land related
conflicts over the last decade.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Prisoners seized control of an
overcrowded police jail in an eight-hour rebellion Friday that left
three inmates dead.
	   The uprising followed a foiled escape attempt at the First
Precinct station in Diadema, a poor industrial suburb of Sao Paulo,
police chief Mikiaki Yamamoto said.
	   Three prisoners were stabbed to death with homemade knives,
apparently in a settling of scores among inmates, he said. TV
footage showed prisoners with improvised masks milling around the
body of a victim lying in the yard.
	   The uprising ended when a judge agreed to transfer 20 prisoners,
Yamamoto said.
	   The Diadema jail was built to hold 60 prisoners but housed 209.
Overcrowding is chronic and often breeds violence, including 195
jail rebellions last year in Sao Paulo state alone.
	   This week, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed a bill
allowing some non-violent criminals to do community service or pay
a penalty instead of going to jail. The measure is expected to
reduce overcrowding.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A 4.4-magnitude earthquake Friday centered
off the southern coast of Mexico rattled the tourist resort of
Acapulco but apparently did no damage.
	   The quake occurred at 9:29 a.m. local time (15:29 GMT) and was
centered about 25 miles (40 kms) east of Acapulco in southern
Guerrero state, the National Seismological Service said.
	   Acapulco Fire Chief Lazaro Manuel Martinez said the earthquake
had caused some alarm among tourists and residents but no injuries
or damaged had been reported, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Four officials at Lima's central morgue were
charged with selling human body parts after a TV station filmed the
sale of a heart in an alley behind the morgue, authorities said
Friday.
	   Two autopsy technicians have been charged with selling organs,
the Attorney General's Office said. The morgue's director and
administrator were charged with misconduct and obstructing an
investigation into the alleged organ trafficking ring.
	   The report by Channel 2 showed a medical student paying 250
Peruvian soles (dlrs 80) for the heart while several middlemen
hovered outside the morgue, located in Lima's tough downtown,
offering to negotiate organ sales. The medical student returned the
next day to collect the heart.
	   Buyers are often students at Peru's underfunded medical schools,
who buy cadavers or organs to use in their studies, the report
said.
	   Authorities said they were looking into the charges.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A leader of Argentina's former
military junta who was detained earlier this week was moved from a
detention center to a hospital for health reasons, authorities said
Friday.
	   The judge, Maria Servini de Cubria, ruled that Emilio Massera,
an admiral during the military's 1976-83 reign, be moved to a
medical facility after doctors said he was suffering from heart
complications.
	   Cubria said she was also considering a request by Massera's
lawyer that he be put under house arrest while her investigation
continues.
	   Argentine law allows for prisoners over the age of 70 to be
confined to their home.
	   Massera is being held on charges of kidnapping children born to
slain dissidents during the military's rule and giving them to
officials in the armed forces.
	   He was the second official of the junta to be arrested this
year. Jorge Videla, a former army lieutenant general, was detained
in June on the same charges.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Police captured a man Friday that they
had linked to a seven-ton cocaine shipment seized earlier this year
in one of the largest drug busts in Colombia's history.
	   Jose Ignacio Cordoba, 38, was arrested at a luxury home in Cali,
the country's third largest city, said National Police operations
chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado.
	   Cordoba, who goes by the nickname ``Nike'', is a top figure in
the Norte del Valle cartel, an important trafficking organization
based in southern Valle del Cauca state, Salgado added.
	   In July, police in the Caribbean port of Cartagena raided a
maritime cargo warehouse and seized seven tons of cocaine concealed
in metal containers being readied for export through Mexico to the
United States.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Two Mexico City police officers are alleged
to have kidnapped a pair of Colombian tourists Friday and forced
them to withdraw money from several automatic teller machines,
according to a criminal complaint.
	   The tourists, Santiago Arguella and Victor Apontes, both 22,
said they were abducted by the officers as they left a popular
shopping center west of the city.
	   The officers allegedly drove the pair to automatic teller
machines and forced them to withdraw cash _ demanding dlrs 600 at
first, but later settling for dlrs 280.

Tabloids: Jagger and Hall planning divorce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ This time, it's definitely over between Rolling
Stone singer Mick Jagger and former Texan model Jerry Hall _ at
least according to an array of British tabloids.
	   Hall, 42, has called in a divorce lawyer after the latest
reports of Jagger's infidelities, according to The Daily Mail, The
Sun and other tabloids.
	   The Sun quoted unnamed sources Saturday as saying that Hall
rebuked Jagger, 55, this week at their mansion in southwest London,
after she read newspaper reports that a Brazilian model, Luciana
Gimenez Morad was pregnant with Jagger's child.
	   The Sun said that Hall, who has three children with Jagger, has
contacted attorney Anthony Julius, Princess Diana's lawyer in her
divorce from Prince Charles.
	   Neither Hall or Jagger have commented on the reports, and Morad,
29, has denied Jagger is the father of her child. Lawyer Julius has
refused to comment, although he has admitted in the past that Hall
is a client.
	   Newspapers have long reported details of Hall and Jagger's
stormy relationship. The couple have lived together since the late
1970s and married in 1991.

Japanese professional baseball scout commits suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The chief scout of a Japanese professional baseball
team plunged to his death from an apartment building after
negotiations with a high-school baseball star failed, police said.
	   Orix BlueWave official Katsutoshi Miwata, 53, fell Friday from
the 11th floor of the building in Naha, Okinawa, 1,600 kilometers
(1,000 miles) south of Tokyo, said a police spokesman, who gave his
surname, Matsuno.
	   Miwata was scheduled to meet Friday with high-school pitcher
Nagisa Arakaki, the BlueWave's top pick in last week's amateur
draft, but the 18-year-old had said he was unwilling to join the
team.
	   Police were investigating the death as a suicide, but declined
to speculate on motives. There was no suicide note.
	   Miwata had taken off his shoes and left his wallet on the ground
before leaping.
	   Arakaki had expressed his wish to play for the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks, but Orix had won exclusive negotiating rights to the player
at an amateur baseball draft last Friday.
	   High-school players are required to spend three years in Japan's
corporate baseball league or four years with a university team,
before gaining the right to negotiate directly with pro teams of
their choice. Arakaki had reportedly already begun enrolling in a
university.
	   Friday's suicide sent shockwaves through Japan's baseball world,
which has been debating Japan's rigid amateur draft system after a
number of high-school stars chose to defer entry into the pro
league this year.

	   PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) _ It used to be called Hog Island
by the British settlers who used it as a pig farm.
	   Then it became a holiday hideout for European aristocrats and
reclusive millionaires, who renamed it Paradise for its clear
turquoise waters and fine beaches.
	   Today, Vegas meets the Caribbean on the island in a fantastical
recreation of the legendary lost continent of Atlantis. This
Bahamian dlrs 450 million (equal to the U.S. dollar) brainchild of
South African entrepreneur Sol Kerzner features a rose-colored
``Mayan'' temple topped by a daring, almost-vertical water slide 60
feet (18 meters) long that propels riders through a see-through
tunnel in a lagoon filled with sharks and barracudas.
	   Kerzner says he has created the largest island resort in the
world at Atlantis, which covers 600 of the island's 800 acres (240
of the island's 320 hectares). There's a 63-slip marina and a
seven-acre (three-hectare) snorkeling lagoon teeming with 100,000
tropical sea creatures, from anemones to gigantic groupers.
	   Inside, also, there is water, water everywhere, bubbling from
geysers at tiny pools and, in the main lobby, waterfalls cascading
from four massive pillars supporting the domed 70-foot (21-meter)
ceiling.
	   Kerzner says the resort includes the Caribbean's biggest casino,
set in a 100,000 square-foot (30,000-meter) gaming, dining and
entertainment area.
	   ``I figured with such great water, beaches, miles (kilometers)
of undeveloped beach, and being so close to the U.S. market _ such
a strong marketplace _ I felt that we could develop probably the
greatest resort of the world in time,'' Kerzner said in an
interview.
	   The transformation centers around the 23-story Royal Towers,
which adds more than 2,000 rooms to the 1,150-room property. The
two towers are joined by the Bridge Suite, for which Kerzner said
his Sun International Hotels Ltd. would charge dlrs 35,000 a night.
	   The Bahamian government has invested much in the resort,
offering tax and other breaks as well as building a dlrs 20 million
bridge linking the resort to Nassau's international airport. In
addition, Kerzner has built a subterranean tunnel offering
alternative access from Nassau.
	   Some opposition was put up by businessmen who wanted to ensure
that they got their share of the new tourist trade. Last year,
Kerzner said he was scrapping plans to develop a dlrs 50 million
entertainment and retail complex at the resort. In a compromise, 12
of 15 shops will be let to Bahamian entrepreneurs instead of the
international designer boutiques that Kerzner wanted under
franchise to Sun Hotels.
	   And Kerzner had hoped to buy the entire island, but there have
been a few holdouts, including a shopping mall and hotel.
	   Officials hope Atlantis, which opens Dec. 11 with a gala weekend
and dozes of celebrities invited, will boost a lackluster year for
tourism, which employs 70 percent of the work force and is the
mainstay of the Bahamian economy.
	   In fact, a drop in unemployment from 13 percent to 9.8 percent
this year is largely attributed to construction work at Atlantis.
The resort now is the biggest employer on the island after the
government, with 5,500 workers to the government's 25,000.
	   ``We cannot even begin to think about the failure of Sun,
because it has so much impact,'' said a competitor, Nassau Beach
Hotel general manager G.M. Robert Sands. ``It must work.''
	   Airlines that had cut back service to the Bahamas are looking to
expand. TWA has a new nonstop service from New York's Kennedy
airport in February, Delta has upgraded its daily New York flight
from a Boeing 727 to a Boeing 757 and British Airways is switching
its thrice weekly flights from London in March from a DC-10 to a
new Boeing 777.
	   Tourism Minister C.A. Smith said the new and upgraded services
would match a 26 percent increase in hotel rooms this year.
	   Vincent Vanderpool Wallace, the Bahamas director-general of
tourism, waxes poetic about Atlantis.
	   ``I believe that Atlantis is the first true manifestation of a
growing belief that neither the Bahamas nor the Caribbean can
continue to rely primarily on sun, sand, and sea for attracting
visitors,'' he said. ``We have the world's greatest canvas in this
region, but we are only just beginning to paint it.''

A trickle of American tourists returning to Iran

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Inside the Islamic Museum in Tehran, Mimi
McLaughlan of Chicago was studiously taking notes, a tuft of gray
hair protruding beneath the scarf she wore to comply with Islamic
laws.
	   The low hum of conversation in the darkened hall of Islamic art
treasures mingled with camera clicks. In a corner, Katherine O'Hara
of New York was taking snapshots of a 17th-century book cover with
signs of the zodiac.
	   The two women moved on with their group of American tourists,
led by guide Peter Morgan of Britain who stopped to extol a section
of an early 12th-century mud wall engraved with brown cursive
writing in a stylized form of Islamic calligraphy called Kufic.
	   ``I love Islamic art,'' says McLaughlan, 62, leaning on her
cane.
	   Overcoming nearly two decades of Iran-U.S. hostility, people
such as McLaughlan and O'Hara are trickling back, drawn by the
cultural and historical grandeur of an ancient land that many
Americans have long associated with Islamic fanaticism.
	   They are coming despite a U.S. State Department warning against
traveling to Iran, where militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy
in 1979 after the Islamic Revolution and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.
	   Amid the bad blood that flowed afterward, America became the
``Great Satan,'' and the slogan ``Death to America'' was a virtual
anthem for many Iranians.
	   But time is healing mistrust on both sides, and a potent balm
has been applied by President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric.
After his election in May 1997, Khatami proposed cultural exchanges
between Iranians and Americans.
	   ``Americans are missing out so much on an incredible country and
incredible people,'' says Meghen Fife, the tour coordinator.
	   According to Iran's Tourism Organization, just over 2,000
Americans came to Iran in the past year, only about 0.1 percent of
the total tourist arrivals. In contrast, 130,000 Western Europeans,
182,000 South Asians and 312,000 people from the Caucasus Mountains
region visited.
	   Despite more relaxed social mores under Khatami, Iran does not
exempt Westerners from the Islamic dress code of modesty, requiring
women to cover every part of their body except the face.
	   ``I found it strange the first couple of days, bothersome the
following couple of days and then got used to it _ until it gets
too hot,'' says O'Hara, a thick black scarf pinned under her chin
and a long skirt and shirt draping her tall body.
	   ``That's the one thing I don't like. It's inconvenient,'' says
McLaughlan, a self-declared ``Asia freak'' and a retired social
worker whose obsession with the continent started with a visit to
Japan 30 years ago. From Japan she began wending her way west
during vacations, but the revolution preceded her to Iran.
	   For now, McLaughlan and her friends, back in Tehran after a
10-city tour, were too delighted by the friendliness of Iranians
and the sights to bother much about having to wear head coverings.
	   ``People have been nice to us. Their faces light up when they
find out we are Americans. They said `America is good,'''
McLaughlan says.
	   The only hostility the Americans encountered was a ``Death to
America'' sign at their Homa Hotel in the northeastern holy city of
Mashhad.
	   ``We were not offended because we were overwhelmed by people's
friendliness. I haven't seen this kind of friendliness anywhere
else. The hotel staff apologized profusely for the sign,'' said
O'Hara, 40-year-old lawyer.
	   The few grouses she had were typical of tourists everywhere.
	   ``It's not an easy country to travel,'' O'Hara said. ``Hotels
are in need of upgrading, renovating. There's a lack of western
bathrooms. All signs are in Persian.''
	   One big gripe was that she couldn't take any Persian rugs home
with her because of a U.S. trade embargo against Iran.
	   Still, there were enough memories and pictures to take back.
	   Iran's tourist sites are a smorgasbord of Islamic mosques,
Persian palaces, houses where exquisite rugs are woven and bazaars
on the crossroads of ancient trade routes still abuzz with
commerce.
	   The group arrived in Iran Oct. 12 on an 18-day tour organized by
Distant Horizons, one of the three U.S. companies to offer group or
individual trips of up to 24 days.
	   Their itinerary included Mashhad and Isfahan.
	   Mashhad isthe burial site of Imam Reza,a Shiite Muslim saint
whose tomb is a magnificent complex of gold domes, blue mosaics,
mirrored walls and bubbling fountains.
	   In the central city of Isfahan, they spent three nights, soaking
in the beauty of the Imam Mosque whose peaked arches and
intricately cut mosaics have enthralled visitors since the 17th
century.
	   Isfahan scored highest on their favorite city list.
	   ``I could spend the whole day at the Royal Mosque and absorb the
harmony of proportions, almost like it floats,'' said O'Hara.

Americans Silverstein and Pekarek win ice dance title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Jamie Silverstein and partner Justin
Pekarek took the gold medal in the ice dance at the world junior
figure skating championships.
	   Silverstein, 14, and Pekarek, 17, sparkled to the tunes of
Secret Garden on Friday, collecting scores ranging from 5.1 to 5.6
for technical merit and 5.6 to 5.7 for artistry.
	   It was a dramatic improvement for the duo who finished in tenth
place at last year's championship in Canada and the second straight
title for the United States.
	   The pair also collected dlrs 16,500 in prize money.
	   Frederica Faiella and Luciano Milo of Italy matched their last
year's performance, taking second, while Russian's Natalia
Romaniuta and Danil Barantsev came in third.
	   In the ladies short program, Russian skaters swept the top two
podium places with Daria Timoshenko turning in the best score to
maintain her lead earned in the qualifying. Timoshenko received
dlrs 11,000 in prize money.
	   She was followed by Victoria Volchkova, who took the bronze
medal last year, and Sarah Hughes, a 13 year-old rising American
talent.
	   The dance event combines skating with ballroom dancing, with a
strong emphasis given to composition and how well the partners
interpret the music.
	   In Canada, the Russians took all three medals.
	   The championship ends Saturday with the ladies free skate and a
gala for the winner's of all disciplines on Sunday.

Fuji Heavy Industries chairman questioned over lawmaker scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors have questioned the chairman of Fuji
Heavy Industries Ltd. on suspicion of bribing a scandal-tainted
lawmaker for help in obtaining a Defense Agency contract, a news
report said Saturday.
	   Isamu Kawai, 70, and other Fuji Heavy executives are suspected
of bribing ruling party lawmaker Yojiro Nakajima, arrested on fraud
charges, while the legislator was a parliamentary vice defense
minister, Kyodo News reported.
	   Fuji allegedly sought Nakajima's help in joining a project to
develop a search-and-rescue amphibian craft for Japan's Marine
Self-Defense Forces, Kyodo said.
	   On Thursday, prosecutors arrested Yasuyuki Kogure, 64, a former
Fuji Heavy executive director, for allegedly giving 5 million yen
(dlrs 41,000) in kickbacks to Nakajima.
	   Nakajima, 39, a Liberal Democratic Party member of Parliament,
was arrested last month on charges of ordering false receipts made
to account for missing party money. The arrest was unrelated to the
Fuji Heavy Industries case.
	   Investigators also suspect money Fuji Heavy Industries gave to
Nakajima was used to bribe other members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and his supporters in preparation for an election.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru automobiles, has said it
donated 4 million yen (dlrs 33,000) to Nakajima since 1993, and
bought 740,000 yen (dlrs 6,115) worth of tickets for fund-raising
parties for the lawmaker.
	   In a separate scandal involving the Defense Agency, ministry
officials are being investigated for allowing NEC Corp. inflate
defense contracts bills in exchange for cushy executive posts for
retiring bureaucrats.
	   Two Defense Agency officials have been indicted in the scandal,
as have a dozen employees at NEC and two of its subsidiaries.
	   Defense Minister Fukushiro Nukaga resigned last week to take
responsibility for the scandal.
	   Japan's political world has been rocked by a series of
corruption scandals in recent years that have exposed cozy ties
between government officials and businesses.

Cleaner acquitted for accepting cigarettes in payment from Iraqi
</HEADLINE>
embassy

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Accepting tax-free cigarettes as payment is
understandable when that's all the Iraqi embassy can afford to pay,
a Canadian judge has ruled.
	   A woman who hadn't been paid for cleaning work at the Iraqi
embassy for more than two months did nothing wrong in accepting the
cigarettes, Judge Jennifer Blishen said Friday.
	   Anahit Geodjzjan, 46, was strip-searched and charged with
possessing illegal tobacco after accepting tax-free cigarettes from
her employer Oct. 8, 1997.
	   A beaming Geodjzjan leapt from her seat, upon hearing the
verdict. ``Thank you, Your Honour,'' she said. ``Thank you.''
	   The Russian immigrant was initially thrilled to receive the
gift. She had been promised a Canadian dlrs 450-a-month (dlrs U.S.
300) salary but had yet to receive a cent, the court was told.
	   She didn't know it was illegal to accept tax-free cigarettes
intended for embassy personnel only.
	   Blishen said Geodjzjan acted as any ``reasonable person in these
circumstances,'' and never thought she was receiving ``anything
other than a legitimate gift.''
	   After the ruling, Geodjzjan's lawyer, Julianne Dunbar,
questioned police and the Crown's decision to prosecute the woman.
	   ``She was the victim in all this,'' said Dunbar, adding she
didn't get paid, had her gift taken away and then was charged.
	   Prosecutor Pierre Lapointe defended the use of police and court
time _ which included hiring a Russian interpreter for court dates
_ to prosecute the cleaner.
	   ``There's a law that we have to pay (tobacco) taxes. This
offence isn't as serious as murder or sexual assault, but it's
still against the law and merits prosecution,'' he said.
	   Geodjzjan was arrested after she was given two cases of
cigarettes and several bottles of alcohol.
	   The cigarettes were bought by the embassy at a steep discount
because it doesn't pay federal tobacco taxes.

Kasprowicz.
	   England suffered a major setback when Graham Thorpe was ruled
out with back stiffness. His place was taken by Graeme Hick, who
arrived as a cover for opener Mike Atherton.
	   In the three changes made to the side that was saved from likely
defeat in the first test by rain in Brisbane, fast bowler and test
debutant Alex Tudor came in for Angus Fraser and as England opted
for a seventh batsmen, with John Crawley nudging out off spinner
Robert Croft.
	   Teams:
	   AUSTRALIA: Mark Taylor (captain), Michael Slater, Justin Langer,
Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Damien Fleming,
Jason Gillespie, Colin Miller, Glenn McGrath; 12th man: Michael
Kasprowicz

Tabloids: Jagger and Hall planning divorce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 4th graf that Jagger and Hall have four STED three
children. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ This time, it's definitely over between Rolling
Stone singer Mick Jagger and former Texan model Jerry Hall _ at
least according to an array of British tabloids.
	   Hall, 42, has called in a divorce lawyer after the latest
reports of Jagger's infidelities, according to The Daily Mail, The
Sun and other tabloids.
	   The Sun quoted unnamed sources Saturday as saying that Hall
rebuked Jagger, 55, this week at their mansion in southwest London,
after she read newspaper reports that a Brazilian model, Luciana
Gimenez Morad was pregnant with Jagger's child.
	   The Sun said that Hall, who has four children with Jagger, has
contacted attorney Anthony Julius, Princess Diana's lawyer in her
divorce from Prince Charles.
	   Neither Hall or Jagger have commented on the reports, and Morad,
29, has denied Jagger is the father of her child. Lawyer Julius has
refused to comment, although he has admitted in the past that Hall
is a client.
	   Newspapers have long reported details of Hall and Jagger's
stormy relationship. The couple have lived together since the late
1970s and married in 1991.

Germans win two-man competition; U.S. ties for second
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Germany's Christoph Langen shrugged off a
bad week of training and navigated the serpentine Bear Hollow
bobsled course in a record-setting performance to win a two-man
World Cup bobsled race.
	   Tied for second Friday were Brian Shimer, driving USA I, and
Guenther Huber, in Italy I, just 28-hundredths of a second behind.
	   Langen covered the 15-curve track built for the 2002 Winter
Olympics in a combined time of 1 minute 38.01 seconds for two runs.
He and brakeman Thomas Platzer set track records for their second
start _ 4.82 seconds _ and their first run _ 48.90 seconds.
	   Langen said he did not expect to win in his first race at Park
City.
	   ``Especially not when I come to a new track,'' he said.
``There's so much I had to learn.''
	   Shimer, seventh two weeks ago in the tour's first race at
Calgary, Alberta, was third after his initial run and moved briefly
into first after his second.
	   Canada's Pierre Lueders couldn't beat Shimer's combined time of
1:38.29, but then Huber matched it and Langen shot past it.
	   For Shimer and brakeman Paul Wise, who has been nursing a sore
hamstring, the race was a confidence-booster after the performance
in Calgary.
	   ``I would say that first trip down the hill was my best of the
season,'' Shimer said. ``The way we came into the season, I'm not
blinking an eye at a silver.
	   ``I count my blessings that we came away with a medal today.''
	   Lueders, who tied Huber for the two-man gold medal at the Nagano
Olympics earlier this year and opened the current season with a win
at Calgary, was satisfied with a fourth-place finish.
	   ``I have nothing to be ashamed of today,'' he said, but added
that he should have had a better first run, positioning himself
better for the final run.
	   USA III driver Todd Hays finished fifth in 1:38.45 thanks to a
strong second run.

Cancer-stricken Tampa Bay center retires, moves into coaching
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ The John Cullen comeback story is over.
	   The Tampa Bay Lightning center, who missed all of last season
while battling cancer, announced his retirement on Friday.
	   Cullen, 34, will remain with the team as an assistant coach.
	   ``My goal was to come back and play; to make it back after a
bone marrow transplant and all the radiation I had, and I did it,''
said Cullen, who was pointless in four games with the Lightning
this season. ``The greatest thing was just to get back, but the
greatest thing of all is being healthy.''
	   After making the Tampa Bay opening game roster, Cullen was
reassigned to Cleveland of the IHL on Oct. 26.
	   Cullen returned to his Tampa area home last Sunday after coming
down with bronchitis. The nine-year NHL veteran said he wrestled
with the issue of retiring during the past week.
	   ``I've been going crazy all week, deciding what to do,'' Cullen
said. ``I knew my shot to return was slim. It was a tough decision,
but I'm comfortable with it.''
	   Cullen said that being with his family in the Tampa area was a
major factor. The two-time All-Star also said he still has some
side effects, including a diminished conditioning level, from his
extensive cancer treatments.
	   ``If I didn't get cancer, there's probably a good chance I'd
still be playing,'' Cullen said. ``I missed a year and I'm not the
same physically as I was.''
	   Cullen scored 187 goals and had 550 points in 621 career games.

Tropical Storm Nicole strengthens in the Atlantic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Nicole restrengthened Friday, but
forecasters said the storm will not threaten land.
	   At 2200 GMT Friday, Nicole's center was near 25.7 latitude, 43.2
longitude, or about 1,570 miles (2,527 kilometers) west-southwest
of the Canary Islands of the African coast.
	   Nicole is moving west at about 12 mph (20 kph), the National
Hurricane Center said.
	   The storm has 45 mph (72 kph) winds with higher gusts. Tropical
storm force winds extend up to 105 miles (170 kilometers) for the
storm's center.
	   Nicole, the 14th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
formed Tuesday and intensified quickly to near hurricane strength.
It weakened Thursday to a tropical depression and then became a low
pressure center before regaining strength.
	   An impending cold front is expected to sweep the storm away,
said hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence.
	   ``It's not threatening land, but not dissipating as fast as we
previously forecast,'' Lawrence said.
	   A tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm when it has
top sustained winds of 39 mph (63 kph). Tropical storms become
hurricanes as their top sustained winds reach 74 mph (119 kph).
	   The annual Atlantic basin hurricane season begins June 1 and
ends Nov. 30. Such a late-season storm was not unusual, hurricane
experts said.

Dennis Rodman sues World Championship Wrestling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Dennis Rodman has capped off a bizarre month
by suing World Championship Wrestling.
	   The eccentric basketball star who has been married, separated,
and sued in the last two weeks, alleges he wasn't fully paid under
two pay-per-view contracts with WCW.
	   According to the suit filed in Orange County Superior Court and
moved Wednesday to federal court in Los Angeles, Rodman claims
under one contract, he was to be paid a base amount of dlrs 750,000
to be host for an event in Charleston, South Carolina, and to
wrestle in Daytona, Florida.
	   Rodman, 37, was to get half of all gross cable sales revenue
more than dlrs 3.9 million for each event, the suit charges.
	   Richard Howell, a lawyer for Rodman, said the WCW has ``given us
different sets of numbers that confuse us and appear to be in
conflict with other numbers that we have been provided.''
	   Howell said the WCW also now claims Rodman is entitled to a
percentage of the pay-for-view cable TV sales but not the cable
satellite sales.
	   ``We strongly disagree with that,'' Howell said.
	   The suit also alleges a second similar contract covered an event
in Detroit as well as the ``Bash at the Beach'' in San Diego last
July, where Rodman, Karl Malone, Hulk Hogan and Diamond Dallas Page
wrestled.
	   WCW officials could not be reached for comment.
	   A seven-time NBA rebounding champion who helped the Chicago
Bulls win the championship the last three years, Rodman filed
papers last week seeking annulment of his Las Vegas marriage to
former ``Baywatch'' actress Carmen Electra on Nov. 14.
	   And a cocktail waitress who sued Rodman for assault and battery
earlier this month filed a criminal complaint against him Tuesday
at the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's West Hollywood
station.
	   Susan Patterson claimed Rodman jammed a dlrs 100 bill down her
blouse and grabbed her breast on Oct. 3 while she was working at
the Fenix in the Argyle Hotel in West Hollywood.

Powerful family may give up control of Bangkok Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One of Thailand's richest and most
powerful families would give up control of the country's biggest
bank if foreign investors had to step in and save it, a newspaper
said Saturday.
	   Executive Chairman Chatri Sophonpanich Chatri said that if the
economic situation did not improve and the Bangkok Bank's
non-performing loans mounted, foreign partners might have to be
brought in.
	   But he told the Bangkok Post that situation at the bank was ``so
far so good.''
	   ``If we bring in strategic partners, they are likely to demand
power to control the bank and we (the Sophonpanich family) are
willing to accept that,'' Chatri was quoted as saying. Foreign
investors now hold about 48 percent of the bank's shares.
	   The bank has been under the control of the Sophonpanich family
for about half a century. Thailand's most powerful private
financial institution was founded by Chatri's father Chin, a
Chinese immigrant who began work as a coolie and small-time money
lender in Bangkok's Chinatown.
	   The Sophonpaniches are among a score of Sino-Thai families who
still exercise a powerful hold over the economy, although their
wealth and influence has been somewhat eroded since the country's
economic crisis began last year.
	   Chatri said the bank's top management would be reorganized by
the end of the year, and he would step down as executive chairman
to prepare for possible foreign partners. Chatri said he would
remain in some executive capacity at the bank.
	   Bangkok Bank's assets have declined from 1.40 trillion baht
(dlrs 38.8 billion) at the end of last year to 1.27 trillion baht
(dlrs 35.3 billion) as of October 31. Its total credit extension in
the first ten months of this year was 13.2 percent lower than at
the end of last year.
	   Its non-performing loans are currently equivalent to 30 percent
of its total lending.

Old Army post holds a trove of history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY308-310 &QL; 
 &UR; By ED SCHAFER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ What three American presidents served at one
time as commandant of the old Jefferson Barracks Army post just
south of St. Louis?
	   Answer: Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant and Jefferson Davis. Of
course, Davis was president of the Confederate States of America
during the Civil War, but a divided America was still America.
	   Besides, no less than eight commanders of the post here went on
to become Confederate generals. Historian Marc Kollbaum says he has
counted an additional 57 officers who passed through the post and
became Confederate leaders, including Robert E. Lee.
	   Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman and dozens of northern leaders
are also listed among the Jefferson Barracks alumni.
	   Grant, who married a St. Louis woman and dropped out of the
Army, fell on hard times and at one point became a hardscrabble
farmer forced to sell firewood to the post to make a living. The
Civil War came along at the right time for Grant, who reentered the
Army and eventually became its commander-in-chief.
	   ``There's so much history tied up in this place,'' says
Kollbaum, curator of the Jefferson Barracks County Park. ``People
from this area don't know what they have. Visitors who stumble onto
it are amazed.''
	   Today, the spacious park on the bluffs of the Mississippi River
offers athletic fields, picnic grounds and hiking and biking trails
winding among the restored stone buildings of the original fort.
	   There's also a visitors' center and a powder magazine converted
into a museum.
	   Founded in 1826 on land donated by farmers and residents of the
nearby village of Carondelet, the Army post was named after Thomas
Jefferson just months after his death on July 4 of that year.
	   The civilians in the area welcomed the fort for its protection
against marauding Indians, as a source of employment and as a
market for the produce they raised.
	   Originally designated as an ``Infantry School of Practice,''
what would now be called a boot camp, the post quickly became a
staging area for the Army of the West, escorting settlers into the
frontier and fighting the Indian and Mexican wars.
	   Troops from Jefferson Barracks were involved in one way or
another in all the battles against the Indians. Over the years, the
troops defeated the Cheyenne, the Commanches, the Nez Perce and
Geronimo and his Apaches. The Army took its losses at the Little
Big Horn under Gen. George Armstrong Custer on its way to the sad
climax of the wars in the massacre at Wounded Knee.
	   Mementos from those campaigns can be found in the museum.
	   The fort went on to become a major training ground and military
hospital and was turned over early in World War II to the Army Air
Corps as its primary training center.
	   The Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery also welcomes visitors
in search of memories or history.
	   There are more than 127,000 graves at the 302-acre (122-hectare)
cemetery overlooking the Mississippi River and the number rises
daily.
	   ``We are constantly digging,'' says Ralph Church, administrator
of the cemetery for the Veterans Administration. ``We average 17
funerals a day.''
	   The flag is flown at half staff all day over the neat rows of
uniform white tombstones marching over the Ozark foothills into the
distance.
	   Buried in the old section are 3,200 unknowns, primarily from the
Civil War. Fifteen of them are Confederates. Unlike the rounded
tombstones of all the rest, the stones marking Confederate graves,
known and unknown, are pointed, the better, so the old story goes,
to keep northerners from sitting on them.
	   Other sections of the cemetery hold 564 group burials, mostly
crews of World War II bomber and Vietnam-era helicopter crashes.
But the largest single group burial holds the remains of 123
American prisoners of war executed by the Japanese in December 1944
on Palawan Island in the Philippines.
	   In 1862, President Lincoln signed legislation establishing

Survey ranks Union Square Cafe the favorite in New York City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The 18,320 New York City diners participating in
the 1999 Zagat restaurant survey rated Le Bernardin, the French
seafood palace, the best for food. But Danny Meyer's Union Square
Cafe remained the overall favorite for the third year in a row.
	   Meyer's other restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, moved into third
place in popularity.
	   The 20th annual edition of the survey also noted ``major
openings'' throughout the year, including Union Pacific, Cena, City
Hall, EQ, Babbo, Cafe Boulud, Mercer Kitchen and Michael Jordan's
Steak House, ``which hit the floor running even if the start of
Jordan's NBA season was put on hold.''
	   The survey tallies nine New York City restaurants with the cost
of meals averaging dlrs 70 or more, led by Lespinasse (dlrs 77),
Les Celebrites (dlrs 76) and Jean Georges (dlrs 75). The average
for the 20 most expensive spots was dlrs 68.56.
	   That's dlrs 10 more than the next most-expensive city, San
Francisco ( dlrs 58.20), and dlrs 40 more than the cheapest, Kansas
City (dlrs 27).
	   ``However, New York is still a bargain compared to London, where
the 20 priciest restaurants average dlrs 91, and Paris, where the
top 20 come in at a heady dlrs 129 per person,'' the survey said.

 &UR; Reno planners give OK to Beverly Hillbillies Casino
	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ A hotel-casino with a theme based on the
``The Beverly Hillbillies'' television show has been approved by
the Reno Planning Commission.
	   The dlrs 130 million project was proposed by Max Baer Jr., who
played the dimwitted Jethro Bodine on the hit TV show that aired in
the United States from 1962-1971.
	   Baer says Jethro's Beverly Hillbillies Mansion and Casino will
rejuvenate city's sluggish gambling and tourism industry and pump
new life into the struggling Park Lane Mall south of downtown Reno.
	   The hotel-casino would connect to the mall and the nearby
Century Theaters.
	   Baer also has recommended the mall's interior be remodeled to
give a feel of the famed Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.
	   Commissioners also endorsed the project's 240-foot (73-meter)
marquee oil derrick topped by a 70-foot (21-meter) flame.
	   The project must still be approved by the Reno City Council and
Regional Planning Commission.

 &UR; New York's famous fashion benefit offers bargains galore
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tourists who come to New York for fashion
bargains might want to take a cue from the savvy natives, and check
to see if Lighthouse International is holding its well-known,
semi-annual fashion benefit.
	   Twice a year, in the spring and fall, the not-for-profit
organization that helps people who are visually impaired, holds
what it calls the POSH (port outward, starboard home) sale,
offering one of a kind designer samples and gently used goods
donated by some of the city's best known residents.
	   At the POSH sale held at its headquarters this month,
well-dressed men and women were seen snapping up dresses, suits,
furs, shoes and accessories with controlled frenzy.
	   Armani suits and separates for women were on sale from dlrs 75
to dlrs 300, and a Givenchy wool suit for dlrs 125. Chanel bags
were priced from dlrs 250 to dlrs 300. An Yves Saint Laurent wool
overcoat went for dlrs 100.
	   The benefit attracts from 3,000 to 4,000 people over a 3-day
period, and raises on the average dlrs 350,000, Vernice Williams,
the organization's media manager said.
	   Lighthouse International also operates a store, open year round.
It sells such items as closed circuit TVs that magnify printed
words on the monitor, talking watches and calculators and
large-print books.
	   The organization was founded in 1905, and works with other
vision rehabilitation agencies and eye care professionals
worldwide. Its headquarters are located at 111 East 59th Street.
The telephone number is 212 821 9200. The Web site is

 &UR; Disney back on the fast track with new race ride
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Auto fans who have waited two
years to race around a track at Walt Disney World only have to sit
tight for two more months.
	   Disney officials now say the troubled Test Track ride will open
in January.
	   Visitors to the Epcot attraction will be able to climb in a car
and spin around a mile-long course modeled after an automaker's
test track. The ride has been plagued by delays that kept pushing
back the opening date.
	   ``Test Track is the most advanced, most complex ride we've ever
embarked on,'' says Orrin Shively, a Walt Disney Imagineering show
director who developed the ride.
	   Disney officials also announced dates for the openings of
several new attractions, including an expansion of its newest theme
park, Animal Kingdom, and the Florida debut of Cirque du Soleil.
	   Asia, a part of Animal Kingdom devoted to rain forests and wild
creatures from southern Asia, is scheduled to open March 18, said
Bob Lamb, vice president of Animal Kingdom.
	   Cirque du Soleil will open the doors to its special
effects-filled acrobatics show at Walt Disney World on Dec. 23,
with ticket prices beginning at dlrs 56.50. Seventy-two performers
will perform in a 1,600-seat theater at Downtown Disney for the 1
1-2 -hour show.

Cancer-stricken Tampa Bay center retires, moves into coaching
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to FIX slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ The John Cullen comeback story is over.
	   The Tampa Bay Lightning center, who missed all of last season
while battling cancer, announced his retirement on Friday.
	   Cullen, 34, will remain with the team as an assistant coach.
	   ``My goal was to come back and play; to make it back after a
bone marrow transplant and all the radiation I had, and I did it,''
said Cullen, who was pointless in four games with the Lightning
this season. ``The greatest thing was just to get back, but the
greatest thing of all is being healthy.''
	   After making the Tampa Bay opening game roster, Cullen was
reassigned to Cleveland of the IHL on Oct. 26.
	   Cullen returned to his Tampa area home last Sunday after coming
down with bronchitis. The nine-year NHL veteran said he wrestled
with the issue of retiring during the past week.
	   ``I've been going crazy all week, deciding what to do,'' Cullen
said. ``I knew my shot to return was slim. It was a tough decision,
but I'm comfortable with it.''
	   Cullen said that being with his family in the Tampa area was a
major factor. The two-time All-Star also said he still has some
side effects, including a diminished conditioning level, from his
extensive cancer treatments.
	   ``If I didn't get cancer, there's probably a good chance I'd
still be playing,'' Cullen said. ``I missed a year and I'm not the
same physically as I was.''
	   Cullen scored 187 goals and had 550 points in 621 career games.

Jiang speech at university marred by protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Protesters heckled visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin as he spoke at Japanese university Saturday, momentarily
interrupting his speech urging Japan to not forget its militaristic
past.
	   Three protesters were arrested in the hall at Tokyo's Waseda
University on suspicion of trespassing and obstruction of justice,
local media reported. One demonstrator unfurled a banner reading:
``Down with the Jiang regime.''
	   Outside, scores of students protesting torture and human rights
abuses in China shouted slogans and carried anti-Chinese placards.
About 100 protesters staged a separate rally protesting Chinese
nuclear weapons.
	   Several of the demonstrators were dragged away forcibly by
police.
	   Also at the campus, heated clashes erupted between security
personnel and Japanese ultra-nationalists protesting Jiang's visit.
	   On the fourth day of his state visit to Tokyo, the first by a
Chinese head of state, Jiang launched a strong appeal for Japan not
to forget its brutal World War II invasion of China.
	   ``Thirty-five million Chinese soldiers and civilians were either
killed or injured, and China suffered economic losses worth more
than 600 billion dollars,'' Jiang told students at Waseda.
	   He urged Japan to teach its children never to allow a
re-emergence of militarism.
	   The Chinese president was accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, himself a graduate of the university.
	   Jiang was apparently angered after Japan failed to include a
clear written apology for wartime aggression against China in a
joint communique issued Thursday.
	   Japanese right-wingers have strongly opposed any apology for the
war, saying Japan was trying to liberate Asia from Western
colonialism. The omission of a full expression of remorse in the
joint statement was widely interpreted as an indication Obuchi
caved in to opposition from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
conservatives.
	   Later in the day, Jiang was scheduled to meet with business
leaders and hold a press conference. He leaves Tokyo on Saturday
for visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

North Korea to march behind arch-rival South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The North Koreans will have to walk
behind their South Korean rivals during the opening ceremony of the
13th Asian Games because the Thai alphabet is being used in
establishing marching postions, an organizer said Saturday.
	   Santiparb Tejavanija, assistant secretary of the Bangkok Asian
Games Organizing Committee, said an advance team from North Korea
asked him about the marching procedure Friday.
	   He said the North Koreans wanted to know who would march first
and how far apart the team would be when they entered the stadium
at the opening ceremony Dec. 6.
	   Santiparb gave no indication that the North Koreans protested
the plan, saying it was in keeping with well-established games
rules and totally non-political.
	   ``We all have to understand that this is a sports event and
sports have nothing to do with politics. You have all read the
motto of `Friendship Beyond Frontiers,' and that speaks for
itself,'' he said.
	   Despite some lessening of tensions, North and South Korea
continue to be bitter rivals in almost every international arena.

 &UR; Panthers 2, Lightning 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Tampa, Florida, Scott Mellanby scored two goals as Florida
snapped a five-game winless streak with a victory over Tampa Bay,
sending the Lightning to their seventh straight loss.
	   Mellanby scored a goal in each of the second and third periods
to give the Panthers a 2-0 lead before Tampa Bay came back with a
goal by Stephane Richer.
	   The victory was the Panthers' first in seven games at Tampa Bay
(1-3-3).
 &UR; Penguins 2, Rangers 2
	   In Pittsburgh, newly-acquired Alexei Kovalev assisted on two
goals, including Robert Lang's score with 15 seconds left in the
third period, to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a tie with the New
York Rangers.
	   The teams were matched two days after their five-player trade.
Kovalev and Harry York debuted with the Penguins, while Petr
Nedved, Chris Tamer and Sean Pronger all played for the Rangers.
Nedved had an assist for New York, his second in two games.
	   John MacLean and Brian Leetch scored for New York. Aleksey
Morozov scored Pittsburgh's other goal.
 &UR; Red Wings 7, Canucks 1
	   In Detroit, Igor Larionov and Brendan Shanahan both had a goal
and two assists in a seven-goal third period, leading the Detroit
Red Wings over the Vancouver Canucks.
	   Larry Murphy had two goals and goaltender Norm Maracle won his
third straight start in place of injured regular Chris Osgood as
the Red Wings won their fourth straight overall, including two wins
over the Canucks. Detroit won 4-2 at Vancouver last Saturday.
	   Vyacheslav Kozlov, Doug Brown and Tomas Holmstrom scored the Red
Wings' other goals. Markus Naslund scored for the Canucks, who have
lost four straight and six of eight.
 &UR; Predators 3, Mighty Ducks 1
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Patric Kjellberg scored twice and Mike
Dunham earned his career-high ninth win as the Nashville Predators
beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
	   Kjellberg, whose only previous NHL experience before this season
was seven games with Montreal in 1992-93, got Nashville off to a
rare hot start with his fourth goal in the opening period and added
an insurance goal in the third. Kjellberg's first goal of the night
marked the first time in eight games that the Predators had scored
the first goal.
	   Dunham made 26 stops to improve his record to 9-8-1.

Indonesian military says students roughed up plainclothes officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police vowed to arrest alleged
activists who abducted and roughed up a plainclothes officer during
a student protest that ended early Saturday.
	   Several students pushed the officer into a taxi near Jakarta's
main police station on Friday night and later dumped him, bound and
gagged, on a toll road, said Maj. Gen. Nugroho Jayusman, police
chief in Jakarta.
	   About 200 students had marched to the station to protest against
the shooting deaths of nine students in clashes with the military
earlier this month. The fighting broke out during a controversial
government assembly on political reforms.
	   Students say President B.J. Habibie, who took office after riots
and protests dislodged his authoritarian predecessor Suharto in
May, is stalling on pledges to democratize Indonesia.
	   Plainclothes police often infiltrate student protests and
sometimes are caught by protesters and beaten. The officer who was
abducted Friday was unharmed and flagged a taxi, returning to
report to his commander at the police station.
	   There were no arrests.
	   Dozens of student protesters lingered outside the station for
hours, taunting a line of riot officers with slogans such as
``Police are criminals.''
	   The students, many of whom had arrived on buses from the nearby
city of Bandung, lounged in the street and ate packets of rice
while soldiers with sticks and shields watched them in silence. The
last demonstrators left at 2 a.m. Saturday.
	   Many students want Suharto to be tried on charges of corruption
and human rights abuses, and on several occasions have tried to
march to his house in an affluent neighborhood of the capital.
Police and soldiers have blocked them.

Bonecrusher stops Slaughter in second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GARY, Indiana (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion James
``Bonecrusher'' Smith stopped journeyman David Slaughter at 1:50 of
the second round of a their bout Friday night.
	   Smith, a former WBA champ, moved in straight and landed punches
from the start. The 45-year-old boxer, who weighed about 260
pounds, opened cuts on Slaughter's face in the first round.
	   The referee stopped the fight in the second.
	   Smith (44-16-1) lost his WBA crown to Mike Tyson in 1987. He
last fought in July in Brisbane, Australia, against Joe Bugner.
Smith had to quit after the first round of that fight when he threw
out his shoulder.
	   He used the fight Friday as a tuneup, and said he wants to fight
George Foreman, Larry Holmes or Buster Douglas _ all former
champions.
	   Smith, who hold a business degree from Shaw University in
Raleigh, North Carolina, recently said he is trying to make a
comeback for the money.

Explosion rocks central African Republic capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ An explosion just
outside the French Embassy rocked the Central African Republic's
capital late Friday, a diplomat said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, the French
diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the embassy sustained any
damage, but the blast happened just outside the diplomatic compound
near the banks of Bangui's Oubangui River.
	   The Central African Republic has been witness to brutal violence
in recent years _ a combination of terrorism, general lawlessness
and rebellions.
	   For years, French military personnel helped prop up President
Ange-Felix Patasse's government. The French withdrew earlier this
year and were replaced by a multinational United Nations
peacekeeping force.
	   The Central African Republic's former colonial power, ties with
France have been strained in recent years. In October, authorities
ordered the expulsion of a Frenchman working at his embassy in
Bangui, accusing him of subversive activities.
	   Despite the constant threat of violence in the Central African
Republic, voters earlier this month participated in the first round
of legislative polls without any major incident. The second round
of the elections is scheduled for Dec. 16.
	   The Central African Republic is still trying to emerge from the
tyrannical 1960s and 1970s rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel
Bokassa, who was accused of corruption, murder, widespread torture
and cannibalism.
	   Deposed in a bloodless 1979 coup, the Central African Republic
in Bokassa's wake remains a troubled and isolated country prone to
bombings and rebel attacks.
	   Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against Patasse, whose election in 1993 ended more than
a decade of army rule.

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ An explosion just
outside the French Embassy rocked the Central African Republic's
capital late Friday, a diplomat said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, the French
diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The embassy sustained only minor damage, with a few windows
shattered by flying debris. The blast happened just outside the
main embassy walls near the banks of Bangui's Oubangui River.

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Eric Lindros and Keith Jones each had a goal
and two assists and John LeClair scored the game-winner during a
wild second period as Philadelphia snapped Toronto's three-game
winning streak, 4-3 Friday.
	   Rod Brind'Amour also scored for the Flyers and LeClair added a
pair of assists for Philadelphia, which has won five of its last
six games.
	   Igor Korolev and Todd Warriner each had a goal and an assist,
and Dimitri Yushkevich also scored for the Maple Leafs, who missed
a chance for their longest winning streak in four years.
 &UR; Bruins 5, Canadiens 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Boston scored five goals in the final period, two by
Sergei Samsonov in a span of about six minutes to beat struggling
Montreal.
	   Ray Bourque, Don Sweeney and Jason Allison also had third-period
goals for the Bruins, who jammed their scoring into the opening
12:19 of the final period en route to their fourth consecutive win.
	   Saku Koivu had a second-period goal for Montreal, losers of six
of its last seven games.
	   Byron Dafoe, coming off his fourth shutout of the season in a
1-0 win at Florida on Wednesday night, had 24 saves for Boston.
 &UR; Sharks 4, Blues 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Jeff Norton scored a power-play goal with 8:56
remaining as San Jose won its first road game.
	   The Sharks, 1-5-3 on the road this year, appeared ready to go
down once again after Chris Pronger's goal at 4:47 of the third
period gave the Blues a 2-1 lead. But Steve Guolla tied the game 17
seconds later, and Norton scored his first goal on a slap shot from
the left circle while Pronger was in the box for interference.
	   Marco Sturm added an unassisted empty net goal at 18:47 to ice
the game.
 &UR; Panthers 2, Lightning 1 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, FLorida, Scott Mellanby scored two goals as Florida
snapped a five-game winless streak with a victory over Tampa Bay,
sending the Lightning to their seventh straight loss.
	   Mellanby scored a goal in each of the second and third periods
to give the Panthers a 2-0 lead before Tampa Bay came back with a
goal by Stephane Richer.
	   The victory was the Panthers' first in seven games at Tampa Bay
(1-3-3).
 &UR; Penguins 2, Rangers 2 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, newly-acquired Alexei Kovalev assisted on two
goals, including Robert Lang's score with 15 seconds left in the
third period, to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a tie with the New
York Rangers.
	   The teams were matched two days after their five-player trade.
Kovalev and Harry York debuted with the Penguins, while Petr
Nedved, Chris Tamer and Sean Pronger all played for the Rangers.
Nedved had an assist for New York, his second in two games.
	   John MacLean and Brian Leetch scored for New York. Aleksey
Morozov scored Pittsburgh's other goal.
 &UR; Red Wings 7, Canucks 1 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Igor Larionov and Brendan Shanahan both had a goal
and two assists in a seven-goal third period, leading the Detroit
Red Wings over the Vancouver Canucks.
	   Goaltender Norm Maracle won his third straight start in place of
injured regular Chris Osgood as the Red Wings won their fourth

4-2 at Vancouver last Saturday.
	   Martin Lapointe, Vyacheslav Kozlov, Doug Brown, Larry Murphy and
Anders Eriksson scored the Red Wings' other goals. Markus Naslund
scored for the Canucks, who have lost four straight and six of
eight.
 &UR; Predators 3, Mighty Ducks 1 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Patric Kjellberg scored twice and Mike
Dunham earned his career-high ninth win as the Nashville Predators
beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
	   Kjellberg, whose only previous NHL experience before this season
was seven games with Montreal in 1992-93, got Nashville off to a
rare hot start with his fourth goal in the opening period and added
an insurance goal in the third. Kjellberg's first goal of the night
marked the first time in eight games that the Predators had scored
the first goal.
	   Dunham made 26 stops to improve his record to 9-8-1.
 &UR; Stars 4, Capitals 0 &QC; 
	   In Dallas, Mike Modano had two goals and an assist and Derian

Jiang speech at university marred by protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of arrests; Edits lightly thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Protesters heckled visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin as he spoke at a Japanese university Saturday, momentarily
interrupting his speech urging Japan to not forget its militaristic
past.
	   Three protesters were arrested after scuffling with security
guards in the hall at Tokyo's Waseda University, police said. One
demonstrator unfurled a banner reading: ``Down with the Jiang
regime.''
	   Outside, scores of students protested torture and human rights
abuses in China, shouting slogans and carrying anti-Chinese
placards. About 100 demonstrators staged a separate rally against
Chinese nuclear weapons.
	   Several of the protesters were dragged away forcibly by police.
	   Also at the campus, heated clashes erupted between security
personnel and Japanese ultra-nationalists protesting Jiang's visit.
	   On the fourth day of his state visit to Tokyo, the first by a
Chinese head of state, Jiang launched a strong appeal for Japan not
to forget its brutal World War II invasion of China.
	   ``Thirty-five million Chinese soldiers and civilians were either
killed or injured, and China suffered economic losses worth more
than 600 billion dollars,'' Jiang told students at Waseda.
	   He urged Japan to teach its children never to allow a
re-emergence of militarism.
	   The Chinese president was accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, a Waseda graduate.
	   Jiang has apparently been angered by Japan's failure to include
a clear written apology for wartime aggression against China in a
joint communique issued Thursday.
	   Japanese right-wingers have strongly opposed any apology for the
war, saying Japan was trying to liberate Asia from Western
colonialism. The omission of a full expression of remorse in the
joint statement was widely interpreted as an indication Obuchi
caved in to opposition from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
conservatives.
	   Later in the day, Jiang was scheduled to meet with business
leaders and hold a press conference. He leaves Tokyo on Saturday
for visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

England teetering on 76 for six at lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The Australian pace quartet led by Glenn
McGrath left England battered, bruised and humbled on a fast and
bouncy WACA pitch on the first morning of the second Ashes cricket
test Saturday.
	   Sent in to bat, England was teetering on 76 for six at lunch
with Mark Ramprakash and Dominic Cork on 22 and naught
respectively.
	   After dismissing Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain in the space
of 15 balls, McGrath nailed Ramprakash on the chin, inflicting a
cut.
	   Ramprakash resumed after attention from team physiotherapist
Wayne Morton, but stitches were to be inserted during the lunch
break, a team spokesman said.
	   McGrath, who has tortured Atherton in a personal dual spread
over nine tests, once again dismissed the former England captain.
It was the 12th time he's caught Atherton since claiming his wicket
for the first time in Perth in February 1995.
	   Atherton sparred at an outswinger to give wicketkeeper Ian Healy
the second of his four catches of the morning.
	   McGrath, with 36 wickets in Australia 3-2 Ashes success in 1997,
continued with his seven-wicket match haul in the first test in
Brisbane with 3-26, bowling 11 overs on the trot.
	   It was only the fourth time in Mark Taylor's 46-test captaincy
that he has won the toss and sent a team in to bat.
	   When Ramprakash's injury forced the first break, England was 29
for three with the ball exploding off the pitch making batting
difficult.
	   Alec Stewart came out of a twin failure in the first test with a
quick-fire 38 off 29 balls, but McGrath avenged for the 14 runs the
England captain took off his eighth wicket, forcing him to play on.
	   McGrath's new-ball partner Damien Fleming began the slide,
forcing the in- form Mark Butcher to drive with minimal footwork
and give 'keeper Ian Healy the first of his three catches.
	   Gillespie, playing his first test in 15 months since the 1997
Ashes series, dismissed John Crawley (four) and Graeme Hick in
three balls minutes before lunch. Replacement batsman Hick, who
came in for an injured Graham Thorpe, lasted two balls and failed
to score.
	   Gillespie took 2-18 and Fleming 1-26. (ik/djp)
